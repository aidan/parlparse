                special funding, and immediately before the Adjournment debate
                tomorrow there be a private notice question in the name of Mrs
                Mary Nelis about the Transtec company.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The final stage of the Appropriation Bill is
                the first item on this week’s Order Paper. The matter was well
                aired in debate on the Estimates, no amendments have been tabled
                at any stage, and no notice has been received of Members wishing
                to speak. I therefore propose, by leave of the Assembly, that we
                take not more than 30&nbsp;minutes for this item.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Speaker. I am
                concerned about the authority of your office. Last week a Member
                took upon himself the role of &quot;Pope&quot;. In view of the
                statement by that Member, who in other places exercises powers
                of infallibility, will you confirm that he will not be allowed
                to exercise those powers in this House and that your authority
                will remain paramount?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Whatever authority the Speaker may have, it
                is much more limited than that of the Holy Father. I will simply
                do the best that I can to make the Assembly work, and I have no
                doubt that other Members will do likewise.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will allow up to the full one hour for

                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister (Mr Mallon):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to advise the Assembly that on 21 June
                the First Minister and I, accompanied by the Minister of Finance
                and Personnel, had a series of important meetings in Brussels
                with members of the European Parliament, the Commission and the
                Council.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The aim of our visit was three-fold. First,
                as Members will be aware, over the last 18&nbsp;months the First
                Minister and I have been working to obtain significant
                continuing financial support from Europe to help secure Northern
                Ireland’s transition to a new peaceful society. That is
                something that we must all work towards, and I thank the MEPs
                for their continuing role.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During our visit we met with Commissioner
                Barnier, who is responsible for the structural funds, to
                conclude our negotiations on the first stage of a process that
                will secure the allocation of £940&nbsp;million of support over
                the next six&nbsp;years. That will be channelled through both
                the Transitional Objective 1 and the Peace II programmes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We had a very useful and very heartening
                meeting with Commissioner&nbsp;Barnier. We discussed the
                important role that the Peace II programme can play, both in
                addressing the legacy of the last three decades and in seizing
                the opportunities of peace. In short, it can help us create a
                prosperous, peaceful and inclusive society. When one takes the
                matching funding into account, Peace II equates to
                £75&nbsp;million each year for Northern Ireland. We agreed the
                importance of not just spending these resources effectively but
                creating a highly inclusive plan to implement and monitor these
                important funds.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first stage has now been completed with
                the formal processing of these documents in Brussels. We can now
                turn to the detailed negotiation of the operational programmes.
                In that matter we will work closely with a wide range of local
                interests including local government and the social partners.
                Commissioner Barnier, whose first visit to a region as the
                Commissioner was to Northern Ireland, emphasised his personal
                commitment to our work. He also emphasised the European Union’s
                desire to share in the process of creating peace here. We
                discussed our aim of developing our links with Brussels. This
                includes the opening of an office and increasing the exposure of
                Northern Ireland officials to the European institutions. He
                particularly welcomed these plans.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, the First Minister and I had a
                valuable meeting with Commissioner&nbsp;Byrne, the Health and
                Consumer Protection Commissioner. We supported very strongly the
                real efforts made by our Minister of Agriculture and Rural
                Development, Bríd Rodgers, and the United Kingdom Minister for
                Agriculture, Nick&nbsp;Brown, who are seeking to ensure that
                Northern Ireland can benefit from low incidence BSE status and
                the potential that provides for beef exports. We thanked the
                Commissioner for his continuing commitment to this initiative
                and emphasised the importance of rapid progress. The prospects
                of a resolution of this problem seem to be good and we welcome
                the efforts of the Commission and the support of the United
                Kingdom Government and congratulate the Minister of Agriculture
                and Rural Development on her efforts.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The third theme of our day was to
                re-establish contact with key individuals in both the Commission
                and the Parliament and to start building the links we need to
                ensure that Northern Ireland not only benefits from the European
                Union but contributes to it as well. We had a very substantial
                meeting with Romano&nbsp;Prodi, the President of the European
                Commission, to brief him on Northern Ireland and to invite him
                to visit here.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am delighted to say that he eagerly
                accepted the invitation, and plans will be put in place in the
                coming months. We also emphasised the need for an early decision
                on the eligibility of the Viridian capital fund.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We also met with Commissioner Kinnock, Mr
                David O’Sullivan, the new secretary-general of the commission,
                Sir Stephen Wall, the UK’s permanent representative to the
                European Union and Denis O’Leary, the Irish permanent
                representative. Two of our MEPs, Mr&nbsp;Hume and
                Mr&nbsp;Nicholson, were involved in part of the visit, and their
                presence, as always, was most helpful. We had a series of
                meetings with Members of the European Parliament to brief them
                on developments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This visit emphasised the immense goodwill
                towards Northern Ireland in all parts of the European
                institutions. The successful transition that we are seeking to
                achieve here is of real interest to our European partners. They
                see it as an important development for the European Union. They
                have shown new willingness to support this not just financially
                but also in other practical ways. This is extremely welcome. It
                is important, however, that we do not see ourselves simply as
                recipients of others’ assistance. We have had to learn a great
                deal over the last decades. Those lessons have been hard learnt,
                but we have now a unique experience of seeking to live together
                in peace. Leading a region through the transition from conflict
                to peace is no minor task. It is the task that faces all of us.
                We are not the only region in the expanding European Union that
                faces this challenge. It is important that we share with others
                what we have learnt and, of course, in the process, learn more
                ourselves. We too will be exploring practical ways to see how
                this can be brought about.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr Ian Paisley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the Minister explain to the House when
                this money was first announced and when it will be available? We
                seem to be having a series of announcements about money, many of
                which repeat what is already in the public domain. What extra
                money would we have received if we had met the same conditions
                for Objective 1 as were met by the Irish Republic? What extra
                percentage of funds would this part of the United Kingdom have
                obtained?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What is the result of the agriculture talks
                on the BSE problem? The Minister responsible is today in the
                Irish Republic and absent from the House. Surely her first duty
                is to tell this House what is happening among the hard-hit
                farmers of Northern Ireland. How long ago was the money known to
                be available? Sir Reg Empey made a statement about money from
                Europe being squandered. What actions are going to be taken by
                the Minister to see that this will not happen with this money?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This money is supposed to be extra. It is not
                supposed to be used for areas or programmes to which the
                Government are already committed. The vexed question of
                additionality arises again. Is the Minister prepared to tell us
                that this money will be used for additional and supplementary
                programmes?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These are questions that need to be answered
                by the Deputy First Minister.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the hon Member again, as I do all
                other MEPs, for the help and support that he has given to us on
                this. I am sorry that Mr&nbsp;Paisley was not present last week,
                though no doubt there were good reasons for his absence.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly will know that it is clear to
                everyone who was involved in and understood the institutions in
                the run up to the Berlin summit of 1999 that no region with a
                GDP of more than 75% on average could maintain Objective 1
                status.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No exceptions to that were possible, and none
                was made. The outcome secured for Northern&nbsp;Ireland is much
                better than that obtained by any other former Objective 1
                region. The continuation of the peace programme with full
                additionality means that Northern Ireland benefits as much from
                funding as any other comparable Objective 1 region. We should
                recognise that the battle for the Peace II programme in terms of
                traditional Objective 1 status was crucial for it has created a
                situation in which funding for the North of Ireland is equal to
                that of any other Objective 1 region.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">10.45 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister and I secured this outcome
                after an intensive six-month lobbying campaign with the help of
                all the MEPs to obtain the support of the United Kingdom and
                Irish Governments, the European Commission and the German
                presidency. Fortunately, it was successful.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member raised the question of funds being
                squandered. I should like to point out that the most stringent
                monitoring will be carried out. There is disquiet, and we must
                ensure that we deal with it. We shall do this in the most
                effective and ruthless way possible so that there can be no
                misappropriation or squandering of the funds for which we are
                responsible. I also give an assurance that the Peace II
                programme is additional. That was one of the conditions of its
                being granted by the European Commission, and we shall adhere to
                that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the Member knows, a range of BSE-related
                issues regarding trade must be sorted out to deal with a complex
                system. In Brussels we stressed the importance of rapid progress
                in this area. Both Commissioner&nbsp;Byrne and Nick&nbsp;Brown,
                the Minister of Agriculture, are committed to having this matter
                resolved, and I believe that that will happen. It is impossible
                to put a timescale on it at this stage, but it is on the way to
                being resolved, and that must be good for us all.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Lewsley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome this opportunity to congratulate
                the First Minister, the Deputy First Minister and the Minister
                of Finance and Personnel on completing the negotiations on
                European support mechanisms, including the structural funds and
                the special support programme for peace and reconciliation. I
                also commend the three MEPs on their ongoing work in Europe and
                their working relationship, which, along with the working
                relationship between the parties in the Assembly, are a proof of
                our future strength in Europe.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How can we ensure that partnership boards are
                fully involved in the implementation of the structural funds?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The European Commission has been extremely
                positive about partnership in the peace package.
                Commissioner&nbsp;Barnier stressed the value of such partnership
                during both his visit to us and our visit to him. I also recall
                his predecessor, Monika Wulf-Mathies, placing a great deal of
                emphasis on partnership in her earlier negotiations. The
                question of how we develop it will arise in the next stage. The
                involvement of local government, the voluntary sector and other
                parts of the local partnership — a key part of the Peace I
                programme — is to be considered and developed. I understand
                that proposals on this are being discussed and will come before
                the Executive Committee.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Undoubtedly this form of partnership has been
                a crucial aspect of the Peace I programme, and in the light of
                experience we will wish to see how we can develop this to the
                maximum benefit. I would like to dispel any unease that, in
                effect, the partnership element in the administration of the
                Peace II programme will continue; we will try to ensure that it
                continues in the most valuable way possible. Also, I would like
                to take this opportunity to thank all of those involved in the
                positive elements of those partnerships for the work they did
                and the efforts they made.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McLaughlin:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I
                want to say on behalf of Sinn Féin that we welcome the
                statement. We applaud the very good work of all those who
                contributed to securing this additional funding, both the
                transitional funding and the additional tranche for Peace II. A
                relationship with European partners is a necessary and important
                element in the peace process in Ireland. Of unique importance,
                over and above the continued EU financial support for the
                transitional funding from Objective 1 status, has been the
                continued funding for peace and reconciliation purposes —
                Peace II. A number of concerns in relation to Peace II have
                emerged, and the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister
                — and, indeed, Minister Mark Durkan — will be aware that
                these issues have been raised. The previous balance between
                economic development and social inclusion, which was achieved
                with such remarkable results under the peace and reconciliation
                funding, is now under threat, and that balance may be lost.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A second concern is that there might be a
                hiatus in funding, and I would like to ask the Deputy First
                Minister if this is to be addressed. Now that the funding has
                been secured, would it be possible to arrange for bridging
                funding to ensure that many of these organisations do not
                collapse as a result of a break in funding or a lack of
                continuity?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A third issue of concern is to do with the
                district partnerships, which represent civic society’s
                involvement in this process. A proposition is being seriously
                considered that district councils take over those functions and
                replace the district partnerships. That would be a step back
                from the principle of inclusivity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I note with some assurance the mention in the
                statement that we are talking about a more inclusive process,
                and I hope that that particular aspect will be addressed and
                resolved.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, I want to mention the issue of this
                possibly being the last such funding tranche for peace and
                reconciliation purposes. This is a society emerging from
                conflict into a process of change. That process of change will
                continue to challenge all of us, and it may be necessary to
                attempt to secure continuous support from the EU for this
                process — and I hope that the Deputy First Minister will be
                able to give some indication of this. As a society, we are
                looking towards not just continuous political change but, quite
                possibly, within the foreseeable future, constitutional change.
                That would be of interest to our European partners. Thank you
                very much.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Member for his observations. He
                is quite right: the European Union is a crucial part of our
                existence. I welcome his implication that we should be a crucial
                part of the European existence. We are not simply a region
                sitting with our own problems here; we are part of a European
                Union that has and will have continuing problems — problems
                especially concerning the expansion of the European Union. It is
                my belief that we have a very important role to play in being
                able to make the North of Ireland the template for conflict
                resolution in other places, the template for dealing with the
                transition from violence to peace. I consider that that is one
                of the crucial roles that we should and must play in Europe. It
                is not just a matter of our always looking for what we can get
                out of Europe; we should be asking what can we contribute to
                Europe. The more we do that, the more our voice will be heard
                there.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee has developed an approach that
                strikes a good balance between the economic and social elements.
                Commissioner Barnier also appeared to feel that we were getting
                this right. Economic and social actions can and must be mutually
                supportive. We will continue to listen to the views expressed in
                consultation on this so that the best possible outcome is
                secured in the next phase of negotiations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also take the point that the Member made on
                a hiatus in funding. We have to ensure that that hiatus, if
                there is one, is as short and as painless as possible. I know
                the Member will understand that I cannot anticipate decisions
                that may be made on this by the Executive Committee or by other
                Departments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There should be no tension between the
                partnership boards and district councils. When we look at the
                genesis of the partnership boards we realise that most of them,
                and the community groupings involved, did a remarkable job, in
                difficult circumstances, on issues which were not being
                addressed by Departments or by district councils. That was one
                of the reasons for the creation of those partnerships. We will
                have to get, as in the socio-economic balance, the right mix
                between partnerships at all levels in Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member makes a very interesting point
                about securing continuing support from the EU. We will try to do
                that. We will try to make the North of Ireland as relevant to
                Europe as is possible to try to maximise that opportunity. We
                have to work on the basis that we are not going to see the same
                type of Peace I or Peace II programme. That does not mean that
                we cannot, given our ingenuity, create other ways in which to
                seek assistance, while not at this stage attempting in any way
                to anticipate that we might get it.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I encourage Members to remember that this is
                an opportunity to ask questions. Any intervention should be in
                the form of a question.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Leslie:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the statement from the Deputy First
                Minister about his visit to Brussels. I note the reference to
                the opening of an office in Brussels. What budget has he in mind
                for that office, and what does he anticipate being the
                additional benefits that would be obtained through that office
                in return for the money that it would cost to run it?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In his statement he used the words, in the
                context of that office,</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;increasing the exposure of Northern
                Ireland officials to the European institutions.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is a slightly unfortunate choice of
                words in view of the recent inquiries on the conduct of certain
                European officials. He might like to rephrase that if it is
                going to be used in future. I have no reason at all to think
                that any of the inquiries about European officials will be about
                our officials, but I would not like them to be associated with
                those inquiries by a form of words.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The other matter relates to the question the
                Deputy First Minister has just answered on the peace money. His
                statement says that Peace II equates to £75&nbsp;million each
                year for Northern&nbsp;Ireland. Last week I asked the Minister
                of Finance and Personnel whether this should be spent in equal
                tranches over the period or whether it would be in some other
                configuration. At that stage he thought that equal tranches were
                what was envisaged. I question whether that is sensible. There
                is the distinct probability that this funding will diminish very
                considerably at the end of the current programme. It might be
                more prudent if the amount were higher at the start and then
                tapered. The recipients would become accustomed to getting by
                with a smaller allocation over time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We do not want a repetition of the situation
                which we have now with a great many, often very worthy,
                organisations finding themselves short of funding because of the
                uncertainty between one programme and the next. We should be
                planning for the future to ensure that we do not have that
                problem at the end of the programme.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.00 am</p>
                </i><b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Member for his questions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am advised that the cost will be in the
                region of £500,000 per year. Proposals, soon to be brought to
                the Executive Committee about the office will ensure that the
                money is well spent. The proposals will also aim to achieve a
                number of other things. We have been looking at examples from
                other regions and would like to start by developing an office to
                provide a base for Ministers and officials visiting from
                Northern Ireland. That is important, because as the Assembly
                develops, the number of visits, in both directions, will
                increase.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A small number of permanent staff will have a
                role in ensuring that we have an early warning of developments
                at the European level and this will ensure that the Northern
                Ireland interest is taken into account in all negotiations, in
                the Commission, the Council and the Parliament. We should look
                at the Welsh and Scottish experiences and at how they are
                maximising their presence in Brussels. They know the fast
                tracks, they know how to get on to the fast tracks and more
                importantly, and they know how to get off the fast tracks with
                the maximum advantages.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We also want to see how such an office could
                help us build links with regional authorities from other member
                states to ensure the best exchange of ideas and information. The
                other objective is to establish a role for us in the European
                Union that will transcend funding. Such involvement could
                substantially increase our stock there and ensure that when we
                do need assistance we will be knocking at more open doors than
                might otherwise be the case. We are very keen to work with other
                organisations from Northern Ireland that are also eager to
                develop links in Europe.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second point that the Member made was
                about exposure. I am not sure which elements of exposure the
                Member was speaking of, but I will simplify it in these terms.
                As the relationship between the political process in the North
                of Ireland and Europe increases, I would like to see people from
                there being seconded to here, and vice versa, so that we can
                develop that ongoing process. We have to lose our insularity. We
                have to expose ourselves and our officials to fresh thinking,
                especially from within the European Union.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Regarding the Member’s third point about
                allocating £75&nbsp;million per annum on a decreasing scale as
                opposed to in equal tranches, I am not sure that any
                mathematical formula will be consistent. I will leave that to
                the Executive Committee and to the Department of Finance and
                Personnel. However, thinking of partnership, there are some
                things you cannot quantify, such as the value of inclusion and
                the work done by inclusion. I do not think that we should be
                looking at the Peace II element in that way. While it must be
                effective and efficient, I am not sure that it is something that
                a slide rule could be effectively applied to.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Neeson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the statement made by the Deputy
                First Minister and thank him and his Colleagues. We are well
                aware of the delays in the acceptance of the submission that was
                made from Northern Ireland, so this is very good news for
                Northern Ireland and the Assembly. We want joined-up Government
                in Northern Ireland, so can the Minister assure me that the
                funds will be used in a strategic way, rather than
                Department-led, as was often the case in the past?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A large element of the package deals with
                structural funds, and a major element of that, in my book,
                relates to infrastructure. As a member of the monitoring
                committee that was established during the period of suspension,
                I raised the issue of the crisis with the railways. May I ask
                the Deputy First Minister what provisions have been made to
                address this crisis and what funds have been made available for
                the possible extension of the natural gas pipeline to the north
                west.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, I welcome the announcement that
                there will be an office representing Northern Ireland’s
                interests in Brussels. As a very strong supporter of Europe, I
                would like to be assured by the Minister that the role played by
                the Northern Ireland centre in Europe will also be recognised.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the Member’s first question,
                the detail of the operational programmes still has to be
                negotiated. Like Mr&nbsp;Neeson, I hope that it will be done on
                a strategic basis with the cross-cutting element properly and
                adequately dealt with. With regard to the targeting of social
                need (TSN), it is essential that each Department fully implement
                those proposals and, at the same time, have a strategic overview
                on what must be done.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second question about support for
                railways depends on the view taken by the Minister for Regional
                Development and other Ministers on how we approach investment in
                railways. The rail infrastructure for the North of Ireland is a
                huge issue which must be addressed by the Executive Committee.
                We must make progress here, but railways are not likely to be
                suitable for inclusion in the Peace II programme, although there
                may be scope in transitional Objective 1, but not as an
                addition, as I think the Member will accept.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Morrice:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I join with others in welcoming the Deputy
                First Minister’s statement. A number of people have been
                patting themselves on the back for securing this funding, but I
                am sure that the Deputy First Minister will agree that it is the
                European Union that deserves the appreciation and recognition
                for the strong commitment it is showing to Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Can the Deputy First Minister confirm that
                European Union funding from Peace II, the peace and
                reconciliation fund, will be used for the vital purpose of peace
                building, and for this alone, and that any project which does
                not fit this criterion will not be accepted?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, can the Deputy First Minister
                confirm that intermediary funding bodies which have shown high
                levels of expertise and experience on the ground will continue
                to be used as funding mechanisms for this new programme?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thirdly, I too welcome the increased links
                with Europe and the opening of an office as an extension of
                those links. I hope that it was only a slip of the pen that
                caused mention to be made of increasing the exposure of Northern
                Ireland officials to the European Institutions. Surely what we
                need is to increase the exposure of Northern&nbsp;Ireland’s
                people to these institutions. That includes young people,
                business people, trade unions and other organisations, which can
                become a much greater part of the European project.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Member for those questions. When
                I speak of exposure, of course I mean it at every level. I
                referred to the ones for which we have administrative authority.
                Like the Member, I hope that every facet of life will avail of
                the communications that exist, and especially of the new office,
                which will be a great help.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member asked whether the Peace&nbsp;II
                programme would be used for peace-building alone. I believe that
                the mixture of economic and social priorities has to be right.
                It is very difficult. To put it simply, one of the most basic
                things that puts people at peace with themselves, their
                neighbours and their environment is the hope that they will have
                a job to go to and a wage packet at the end of the week. That
                gives them the self-respect that any family is entitled to. I do
                not think it is possible to draw a simple line of demarcation
                between that which would assist people in the North of Ireland
                in economic terms and that which could be defined as purely
                social input.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The remarkable work that has been done by
                many of the partnerships has been to give people the confidence
                not just to develop their own communities but to develop on the
                type of strategic basis that Mr Neeson mentioned. We must keep
                developing that. I cannot say at this stage which funding
                mechanisms will be retained or sustained, but we are committed
                to building on the success of the peace programme, and
                particularly on those partnerships. Further work is needed on
                how best to bring together all the positive contributions made
                by district councils, social partners and voluntary and
                community groups.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must have an inclusive, grass-roots-based
                process. That is very important to us and to the Commission. The
                Commission has made it clear that that is regarded as being of
                primary importance. We will treat it as such, not only because
                it is the right thing to do — which it is — but because it
                is essential in this type of development to have those
                partnerships working properly, in the proper meaning of the term
                — partnerships with this Administration, with the district
                councils and with the communities.</p>

                will arrive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In his address the Deputy First Minister
                referred to the wider range of local interests, including local
                government and the social partners. I welcome a close liaison
                between local government and the partnership boards, but I have

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will come a bit closer.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to ask three questions about local
                government and social partners.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Deputy First Minister agree that
                local councils have an important role to play in economic
                strategy and can spend up to 5p in the pound of their rates
                income on that sector? Secondly, does he agree that there should
                be more local representatives on the local partnership boards?
                At present they number seven out of 21. Thirdly, and most
                importantly, does he agree that there should be closer
                co-operation between councils and local partnership boards, as
                many councils feel that they would be the poor relation in that
                partnership?</p>
                <i>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Obviously district councils have a crucial
                role to play in developing economic strategy, and they have the
                fund-raising mechanism to facilitate this. There have been many
                instances in which district councils have been the springboard
                for investment and for Government decisions that would not
                otherwise have been made. We must continue to try to get this
                balance right — the balance between economic strategy and the
                need to deal with the social aspects of partnership. The two are
                not mutually exclusive, and we should avoid thinking that
                district councils and district partnerships are exclusive. I
                served on a district council for 16 years. Many of the needs of
                the partnerships were fulfilled by the partnerships themselves
                because they were doing the type of work that neither the
                district councils nor the Departments were equipped to do. The
                term &quot;partnership&quot; needs to be regarded more globally.
                We need to consider partnership between this Administration,
                district councils, partnership boards and other elements of
                social partnership. There will, no doubt, be further discussion
                about the numbers of councillors on partnership boards, and here
                again we need to get the balance right. The more successful the
                current operation is, the more we will extend beyond just
                administering funds to creating broad partnerships throughout
                the community. We ourselves are a product of this process. We
                should not forget that, when we set about trying to resolve our
                political problems, we took as a template the partnerships that
                already existed. From these we created the partnership here,
                known as the Northern Ireland Executive Committee of the
                Assembly.</p>

                to reassure people watching this programme that EU funding will
                reach the people that it is intended to help?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Member for his question, which is
                very important.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I understand that this evening’s ‘Insight’
                programme takes a critical look at excessive, or irregular, EU
                funding for projects under Peace I. I should like to stress
                that, while I am not aware of specific project details, any
                evidence that suggests misappropriation of European programme
                funds has been, and will continue to be, thoroughly
                investigated. These are public funds, and the highest standards
                of accountability must be attached to all these moneys.
                Accountability, value for money and the safeguarding of public
                funds are all of primary concern in the structural fund
                programmes. The programme places considerable emphasis on
                reaching out to grass-roots organisations, but since these are
                public funds, their use must be carefully scrutinised and the
                moneys accounted for through the proper channels. Grants-in-aid
                to intermediary funding bodies and second-tier bodies are
                subject to terms and conditions, which make them responsible for
                the monitoring of grants to final recipients. Government
                Departments remain fully accountable for all EU and matching
                funding handled by these organisations. All structural funds
                expenditure handled by Northern Ireland Departments is subject
                to the normal requirements for Government accounting by the
                Northern Ireland Audit Office and the European Court of
                Auditors.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Any lessons learned from Peace&nbsp;I, along
                with the experience gained by the funding bodies, will be built
                upon in Peace&nbsp;II to ensure that the programme is managed
                efficiently and effectively. This matter was raised with the
                First&nbsp;Minister, the Minister of&nbsp;Finance and Personnel
                and myself by Commissioner&nbsp;Barnier. I say to the Assembly
                what I said to him: &quot;We will not put ourselves in the
                position where we make a case in Brussels for funding, for that
                funding to be in any way misused or misappropriated.&quot;</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I know that there are details that must be
                looked at. They are being looked at, and they will be looked at.
                I would dispel the notion that it is just some of the community
                groupings that are involved. It is much more fundamental than
                that and, therefore, much more worrying. At this stage I assure
                everyone that what can be done will be done in relation to what
                might have happened, and we will ensure there will be no repeat
                of that in any shape or form.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Deputy First Minister’s
                statement. I want to tease out the last sentence on the first
                page of the statement:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;We agreed the importance not just of
                spending these resources effectively, but creating a highly
                inclusive plan to implement and monitor these important
                Funds.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Efficiency and inclusion are important. On
                efficiency, can the Deputy First&nbsp;Minister give us an
                assurance that sustainability will be an important element of
                any projects coming through under peace and reconciliation? It
                should be addressed under project assessment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This follows from Mr&nbsp;Shannon’s
                question. In some projects, district councils are having to give
                assistance. It would be better if the sustainability element
                could ensure that these projects are able to proceed on their
                own. Regarding inclusion, there is a need to be proactive in
                encouraging applications from the Protestant community, whose
                ethos, particularly in the rural areas, has, in the past,
                militated against it availing of the benefits of peace and
                reconciliation funding. I know that there is a need to redress
                the balance in my constituency. I hope that this will be taken
                on board.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Member for his question.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sustainability is very important. It is very
                important in relation to the question from the Member for Foyle
                about the end — for there will be an end to Peace&nbsp;II,
                just as there was an end to Peace&nbsp;I. In seeking
                sustainability, we must recognise that there are elements in our
                lives that cannot be measured. The benefit to the entire
                community in the North of Ireland from some of the input from
                Peace&nbsp;I and Peace&nbsp;II cannot be quantified. It cannot
                be sustained unless we, as part of the political process,
                recognise its importance and ensure that we have laid the basis
                for its sustainability should funding of this nature come to an
                end. The Member’s point is a good one, and it must be kept at
                the forefront of our minds.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He also raised the question of district
                councils, and I reiterate that the ultimate elements of
                partnership involve that between all of us. I know from
                experience that remarkably good work is being done in the
                community by various groupings — work that district councils
                and Government Departments are not equipped to do. One must ask
                why, if district councils and Government Departments regard that
                work as important, they were not doing it when it was most
                needed. In reality there is, and will continue to be, another
                level in our society which needs input on a community basis.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member’s third point related to
                encouraging the Protestant community to redress the imbalance in
                community involvement and in the level and depth of
                applications. I believe that is right. The Catholic community,
                for whatever reasons — and there were many — was better
                geared towards benefiting from this type of funding. It was
                probably better organised on a community basis and hence better
                able to seek this funding. We want to make sure — I intensely
                dislike talking in terms of Protestant or Catholic communities
                — that the entire community in the North of Ireland is in a
                position to seek funding where it is needed and that the
                Administration is in a position to ensure that it gets it.</p>

                everyone involved in securing that allocation for the coming
                months and years. For us, the question is obviously to do with
                implementation. There has to be a balance in implementation
                between east and west. There have been several bids for money
                for certain areas so far. I ask that the needs of the economy in
                the west be given due consideration.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The recent package given to agriculture has
                had very little impact, particularly when one considers the
                negative impact that European policies have had on our
                agriculture industry.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that some of this money will be used
                to try to redress the losses rural areas have sustained because
                of European policies which have made them non-competitive.
                Clearly, this money must be additional. It is important that we
                do not simply use it for Government schemes which should be
                covered by the block grant. In the last round the Government
                tried to get some of the peace money used in this way.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is also the matter of the bid for
                control of the money between the councils and the partnerships.
                Part of the success of the partnerships has been the whole issue
                of social inclusion. The Minister mentioned that those that were
                there previously were not doing the work that the partnerships
                have done. I see that as being part of the success of
                partnerships. It is important that that element be considered
                very strongly indeed and that they have the necessary input to
                deal with this money in a balanced and fair way.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Member for his question. I can
                assure him that, so far as the Executive Committee is concerned,
                it will be done in a balanced and in a fair way. That is the
                type of problem we now have to grapple with in terms of how we
                deal with the negotiations and make sure that those negotiations
                are properly handled.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the western part of Northern
                Ireland, I share his view that we must be aware of the needs of
                all sections of the community — and not just in terms of
                political or religious divisions. One of the biggest divisions
                in Northern Ireland is that between the rural and the urban
                areas. We have to ensure that the rural areas are properly
                catered for, and it is not easy to do that. Rural areas tend not
                to have the infrastructure in terms of community involvement
                that urban areas have. There the problems are not so glaring,
                but they are there.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I can assure the Member that things will be
                done fairly and in a way that the entire Northern&nbsp;Ireland
                community is allowed to benefit from them and that the problem
                of divisions between urban and rural areas will be addressed.
                Some of us on the Executive Committee are from rural Northern
                Ireland, and we will ensure at all times that those needs are
                brought to the attention of other members and dealt with.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hay:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Minister agree that in some parts of
                Northern Ireland there has been serious tension between local
                government and the 26 district partnerships? In fact, both local
                government and district partnerships sometimes see each other as
                a threat. What mechanisms can he put in place between district
                councils and the 26 district partnerships to try to smooth out
                those issues?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is another matter which seriously
                concerns those involved in local government in Northern Ireland.
                It has been the experience of our council that after money has
                been allocated to projects, groups come along asking for serious
                money to make up the shortfall in their finances and also
                looking for running costs for their projects. These costs can
                run into several thousands of pounds. I want to ask the Minister
                how these projects can be sustained. I believe that many of them
                will run into financial difficulties over the next few years.
                The only path that they see open to them is that of local
                government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What mechanism can the Deputy First Minister
                put in place to ensure that both communities share finance
                equally? I am glad to hear him say that there has been an
                imbalance of the spending of European money on Northern Ireland’s
                communities — it is good that he recognises that — and I
                agree that the Protestant community comes from a lower base when
                applying for project funding. There is an imbalance that needs
                to be addressed.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Member for his questions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The question of district councils as opposed
                to partnership boards keeps cropping up in those terms. We must
                try to regard this in terms not just of district councils versus
                partnerships but also of how they could work and dovetail
                together. When the Peace I programme was agreed by Europe, we
                should remember, it was agreed only on the basis of the approach
                that Europe suggested in terms of partnership boards — in
                other words, a bottom-up approach. Commissioner&nbsp;Barnier
                would not have sanctioned Peace II unless there were that
                partnership approach and those mechanisms. That does not
                preclude the fact that district councils could work with
                partnership boards in such a way that it will not be regarded as
                a contest bout that they are working together maximising the
                benefits for their city, town or district council area.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I recognise the shortfall and the unease that
                exists. It is always easy to blame something else, but
                suspension did not help in having this matter finalised, and it
                is one of the contributing factors.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The last question relates to what mechanisms
                there are to ensure that all of the community properly maximises
                its advantage from these funds. I am not sure that there is a
                specific mechanism or mechanisms that could be devised for that,
                but I am sure that the everybody realises that the proper,
                effective and full utilisation of these funds will benefit the
                entire community, and I recommend that type of approach.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">May I too compliment the First Minister, the

                on the encouraging outcome of the work they did in Brussels this
                week. I am sure that Deputy Speaker Morrice will acknowledge
                that this was in the face of considerable competition from
                others interested in securing EU funding.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I note from his statement that the Deputy
                First Minister raised the issue of BSE low incidence status with
                Commissioner&nbsp;Byrne. He also indicated that the prospects
                for a resolution of the problem are good. Will he outline how
                this issue is to be resolved?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Member for his question.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While Northern Ireland complies with the
                criteria for a low-incidence region as set out by the OIE —
                and as we all know what the OIE is, I will not attempt to
                pronounce it from the piece of paper in front of me.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is the Animal Health Organisation, and it
                has a very important say in this matter. We have yet to have BSE
                low incidence status formally recognised by the European Union.
                The main obstacle to achieving that centres on convincing the
                Commission and the other 14&nbsp;member states that we have the
                controls in place to guarantee that only Northern Ireland
                cattle, beef and beef products could be exported.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is the kernel of this problem, and it is
                the kernel of the problem that the Commissioner, the Minister of
                Agriculture (Nick Brown) and our Minister of Agriculture and
                Rural Development (Bríd&nbsp;Rodgers) are addressing. We must
                address it in a way that will minimise any disruption to the
                existing trade in beef and beef products coming into
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland from Britain. Again that is a crucial part
                of the problem.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nick&nbsp;Brown has already made it clear
                that the case would only be progressed on the basis of a full
                and detailed public consultation throughout the United Kingdom.
                To that end DARD and MAFF officials have had preliminary
                discussions with Commissioner Byrne’s officials to agree the
                shape of the consultation document. It is hoped that that
                consultation could start in the next few weeks. Again, I am
                reasonably hopeful that the matter will be addressed at its
                core, which is in ensuring that beef that would come from the
                North of Ireland would be Northern Ireland beef. I look forward
                to a resolution of this matter because I think it is now
                possible to have it resolved in our favour.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This stage provides an opportunity for a
              general debate on the Bill and for Members to vote on its general
              principles. Weights and measures law has a history going back
              thousands of years. In England, it was mentioned in as fundamental
              document as the Magna&nbsp;Carta.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Until about 100 years ago weighing and
              measuring equipment was fairly basic and consisted of simple
              weighing scales and measures of capacity for commodities such as
              wine and grain. During the first half of the
              twentieth&nbsp;century, weighing machines with levers and dials
              and petrol pumps with meters, became commonplace. With the advent
              of electrical devices and more recently micro-electronics,
              equipment has become more tehcnical in its construction and
              operation and it is often connected to other equipment such as
              cash registers.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.45 am</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The history and nature of weights and measures
              law in Great Britain and Northern Ireland has evolved to establish
              suitable units of measurements and to ensure that equipment
              operates fairly, favouring neither buyer nor seller.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Northern Ireland, the law governing the
              verification of weighing or measuring equipment is the Weights and
              Measures (Northern Ireland) Order 1981, and this Bill proposes
              three specific amendments to that Order.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Verification is the examination and testing of
              weighing and measuring equipment before it is allowed to be used
              for trade transactions. The equipment includes things like
              butchers’ scales and petrol pumps. Currently, verification is
              achieved by having the weighing and measuring equipment tested,
              passed and stamped by inspectors of weights and measures before it
              can be used for trade. Inspectors of weights and measures are
              suitably qualified to verify that equipment conforms to the
              relevant regulations, and measures with sufficient accuracy,
              before it can be used.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The purpose of this Bill is to introduce
              deregulatory measures associated with such verification of
              weighing or measuring equipment. These deregulatory measures can
              be achieved without compromising confidence in a fair trading
              environment.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first measure — the self-verification of
              weighing or measuring equipment — will permit approved
              manufacturers, installers and repairers to conduct their own
              testing, passing as fit for use for trade, and stamping of
              weighing and measuring equipment. Currently, such equipment can
              only be verified by an inspector of weights and measures. Any
              approved manufacturer, installer or repairer will have to meet the
              same testing standards as used by inspectors.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second measure — the testing by official
              European economic area (EEA) testers — will allow an inspector
              of weights and measures to accept, as part of the process of
              verification of equipment, test reports from third-party testers
              established in the European economic area.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the inspector is satisfied that the tests
              have been performed by a competent person, he will accept the test
              report as part of his verification of the equipment. That would
              result in a saving to the owner of the equipment, as he will not
              incur the cost of having the test repeated.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The final measure — applying the prescribed
              stamp prior to testing the equipment — will enable manufacturers
              of weighing or measuring equipment (beer glasses, for example) who
              are approved verifiers to incorporate into the manufacturing
              process the stamp to be applied to the equipment. However, the
              manufacturer must have safeguards in place to ensure that the
              equipment will be passed as fit for such trade use and that it
              will not be used until it has been so passed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These three deregulatory measures were first
              proposed for inclusion in the composite Deregulation (Northern
              Ireland) Order 1997. Consultation on that draft Order took place
              here in December 1996 and January 1997. No adverse response to the
              weights and measures provisions was received from this
              consultation exercise. The delay in proceeding was, of course, due
              to the 1997 general election. The measures perished at the time of
              the dissolution of Parliament.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The measures replicate for
              Northern&nbsp;Ireland the provisions contained in the Deregulation
              (Weights and Measures) Order 1999, which was made by the
              Department of Trade and Industry on 1&nbsp;March&nbsp;1999. The
              proposed amendments in this Bill will provide parity with the law
              already in force in Great Britain.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The implementation of the measures contained in
              this Bill has the potential to reduce burdens on business and can
              be achieved without reducing the current level of consumer
              protection in this area.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that I have given Members an
              appreciation of the scope of the Bill and that the Assembly is
              content that it should now pass to the Committee Stage for more
              detailed scrutiny.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr O’Hagan:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want briefly to sound some notes of caution
              in relation to this Bill. Obviously we will be looking at it in
              greater detail in Committee.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the moment, such equipment must be verified
              by an inspector of weights and measures. This Bill means that
              shopkeepers and manufacturers can act as their own inspectors.
              Installers and repairers can verify equipment as fit for trade.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am concerned that this deregulation is
              fraught with opportunities for abuse. I sound a note of caution at
              this stage, and we shall obviously look at it in further detail.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should not go down the road of deregulation
              for its own sake. One must remember the deregulation of animal
              feeds which brought us the BSE crisis. If there is to be
              deregulation we must be careful that, at the very least, we put
              something in place for the safeguard of consumers.</p>

              Assembly Public Accounts Committee give continuing attention to
              the issues raised in the report.</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a Chathaoirligh. I welcome
              the opportunity which the publication of the Westminster Public
              Accounts Committee (PAC) report has afforded the Assembly to
              debate an important issue. Since putting this motion down I have
              been contacted by various Government officials and advised that
              such a motion may be premature as the Department of Enterprise,
              Trade and Investment and the Industrial Development Board (IDB) in
              particular cannot formally reply to the Public Accounts Committee
              at Westminster until 20 July. I have also been informed that it
              will then be up to that Committee to decide if the response is
              acceptable and that the Comptroller and Auditor General will
              monitor undertakings given in the response, reporting back on any
              concerns.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All of this, however, should not and does not
              preclude this debate’s taking place, especially since we are
              heading towards the summer recess. This is too important an issue,
              and there are too many concerns about the activities and
              performance of the IDB, to put this debate off until September.
              Nor does it preclude the Assembly’s PAC from keeping a watching
              brief on the IDB as recommended by its Westminster counterpart.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Over the years, a number of official and
              academic studies have analysed the work of the IDB. These include
              reports by the Northern Ireland Economic Council and the
              Controller and Auditor General, community research undertaken by
              the West Belfast Economic Forum and hearings and reports by the
              Westminster PAC itself. Each of these investigations and reports
              contains remarkably similar findings. These are: that the IDB
              claims to create far more jobs than it actually does; that it
              violates its own criteria for providing grants; that its internal
              performance appraisals are inadequate; that its monitoring of
              grant recipients’ performance is disastrously insufficient; and
              that there is evidence of an unjustified waste of public money.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Further criticisms are also common to several
              reports. These are: that the IDB has failed to locate sufficient
              jobs in areas most in need of employment (namely, targeting social
              need (TSN) areas) in spite of the fact that TSN has been a thread
              in Government policy since 1990; that even those jobs located in
              TSN areas are not held in sufficient proportion by residents of
              the area, especially target groups such as the long-term
              unemployed; and that the IDB has shown an arrogant disregard for
              the public and for Government officials by providing misleading
              evidence and statements and, most significantly, by steadfastly
              refusing to change its bad practices.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report by the Westminster Public Accounts
              Committee expressed surprise that the IDB had to carry out special
              data collection exercises to answer basic questions that it should
              be monitoring as a matter of course. The Committee found that the
              IDB provided evidence that was contradictory, confusing and
              misleading. It concluded, in view of the IDB’s failure to
              respond to previous criticisms or to come under any kind of public
              control, that should devolved Government be re-established, that
              IDB activity is a subject which we should be commended to the
              Northern Ireland Assembly Public Accounts Committee for continuing
              attention.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to turn to some specific concerns
              surrounding the IDB. First, job creation. Studies have
              consistently shown that IDB claims regarding job creation are
              totally unrealistic. The IDB uses a basic indicator called job
              promotions which is a notional figure of the number of jobs that
              could be created in a grant-aided project over a number of years.
              I quote an IDB representative:</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;a job promoted is a result of negotiating
              with the company on a promise that the company will make on the
              basis of its business plan presented to the IDB.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Studies of actual jobs created have shown that
              the number is much less than quoted, and that the duration of IDB
              assisted jobs is quite short. For example, the Comptroller and
              Auditor General found that in the North of Ireland as a whole only
              51% of the jobs promised by IDB assisted inward investors between
              1988 and 1994 were actually created. Moreover, only 36% were still
              in place by March 1997.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is also a disingenuous method in place
              for costs-per-job figures. This is calculated by adding together
              jobs promoted and jobs safeguarded, which are existing jobs that
              were safeguarded by IDB grants. This year’s end-of-year
              statement from the IDB, for example, indicates 7,145 jobs promoted
              and 1,796 jobs safeguarded. These total 8,941. That figure is used
              to calculate the cost-per-job figure, which comes out at £9,507.
              However, when pressed, IDB representatives stated that the actual
              number of jobs created in 1999-2000 was 1,609. There is clearly a
              vast difference in these two figures, and that difference greatly
              affects the cost-per-job figures. The cost-per-job figure also
              does not take into account the cost of running overseas offices.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The IDB also uses various forms of double
              counting in its yearly in statements and annual reports, claiming
              the same jobs promoted over more than one year. The IDB has been
              criticised for using these unrealistic figures and counting
              methods since the 1983 Northern Ireland Economic Council Report,
              yet it has resolutely refused to change this practice. Therefore
              when actual jobs are considered, the IDB’s performance in terms
              of job creation has been to say the least woefully inadequate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to equality issues it appears that
              the IDB has never taken equality seriously by actively promoting
              the siting of projects in economically marginalised TSN areas. In
              response to public pressure, the IDB promised to site 75% of jobs
              in TSN areas. Yet in the period 1988-97 just 30% of projects and
              41% of jobs promoted went to TSN areas. When one looks closely at
              the figures the lack of adherence to TSN becomes even more
              appalling, with only 2·3% of IDB-assisted projects situated in
              west Belfast and none in the Moyle and Strabane District Council
              areas.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Instead of actively overturning this record and
              seriously tackling economic marginalisation and disadvantage, the
              criteria were simply broadened to include areas adjacent to TSN
              areas. This is such a wide category that the IDB can now claim to
              have successfully carried out their equality obligations when in
              fact there has been little operational change.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Up until this year the IDB made no effort to
              ensure that firms that have located in disadvantaged areas hired
              people from those areas. The IDB viewed the hiring practices of
              sponsored companies as the business of those companies. There is
              no monitoring of the equality effects of grant-aided companies
              hiring practices on groups such as Catholics, women or the
              long-term unemployed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Westminster Committee stated</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;it is not enough to record only the
              location of projects the acid test is to measure the extent to
              which jobs are going to people who actually come from
              disadvantaged areas.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The IDB is now beginning to carry out
              monitoring on this basis. This to be welcomed as a step in the
              right direction and should be monitored by the Public Accounts
              Committee here.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.00</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given the IDB’s failure to carry out its
              equality obligations thus far, it is therefore cause for concern
              that it was not obliged to publish a draft equality scheme.
              Instead, the Department’s equality scheme will also cover the
              IDB. The IDB is the largest recipient of public funding within the
              Department. Other agencies under the control of the Department are
              obliged to publish equality schemes. Therefore it is simply not
              good enough that the IDB should be exempt. Basic data on the
              religious and gender composition of workforces in IDB-sponsored
              companies must be maintained and published.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Statistics that measure actual job creation
              should be compiled. The IDB claims it must use the measure of job
              promotion because that is widely used by other agencies and allows
              it to measure its success against its competitors. This is a
              disingenuous argument. First, one method does not preclude it from
              using other methods for measuring performance. Secondly, the IDA
              in the South of Ireland publishes annual statistics of actual jobs
              in IDA-assisted companies by economic sector and location. It has
              carried out an annual survey of employment in all industry since
              1973. That survey gathers data on employment in each company,
              including by gender. As the existing regulations require companies
              to report on the religious composition of their workforces, there
              is no excuse for the IDB’s avoiding the collection and
              publication of a similar survey of IDB-sponsored companies.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another issue brought up by the Westminster
              Committee, and also the subject of other studies, has been the
              internal performance of the IDB — in particular, its failure to
              adequately assess the performance of its units, and especially its
              foreign offices. The Select Committee found that the IDB does not
              yet have a performance-measurement system that clearly
              demonstrates the relative and individual cost-effectiveness of its
              overseas offices, despite the high levels of costs involved in
              running these offices. Such internal accounting must be
              implemented. Not only is it necessary for assessing the efficiency
              of specific units, but it also has an additional impact on other
              statistics. As I mentioned earlier, cost-per-job figures are
              understated not only because of the use of inflated jobs promoted
              figures but further because they do not include the institutional
              costs of attracting companies.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The IDB also fails to collect data on the
              economic performance of grant-aided companies. The Select
              Committee found it unacceptable that it took the IDB five years to
              begin even basic monitoring of the economic efficiency of the
              firms it sponsored, even though it had been told to do so in a
              previous report in 1992-93. Having failed to adhere to Westminster
              recommendations, the IDB must be monitored in this regard.
              Moreover, it is crucial that the IDB extend its data collection
              and monitoring to other areas. It should be conducting annual
              surveys of each company’s performance. It should be looking at
              costs, whether the materials or services are purchased locally or
              imported, its profit rate, where it obtains its technology and at
              what costs, and so on. Citing a company confidentiality clause is
              not enough. The IDA has conducted a complete survey of components
              of sales, including scrutiny of costs and profits since the early
              1980s. All companies are required to provide this by law. As the
              recent performance of the &quot;Celtic tiger&quot; demonstrates,
              such requirements have not affected in the least the IDA’s
              ability to attract companies.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is also need for a review of IDB
              operations in promoting local economic development projects and
              jobs in indigenous companies. The IDB admits that it has failed
              badly in this respect. We must all recognise, whatever our
              concerns, that foreign companies and multinationals will play a
              role in the future development of our island economy. However,
              this should not be to the detriment of indigenous Irish industry.
              Overdependence on transnational corporations does not make for a
              healthy economy. Experience has shown that multinationals whose
              decisions are based on global success rather than local concerns
              are more likely to move away from a host locality if global market
              conditions dictate. The IDB would be better placed promoting local
              industry, which is rooted in local economies and is more likely to
              reinvest its profits in the local economy.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No one denies that the IDB has difficult job.
              Its activities have been severely hampered by several factors,
              including the political conflict and the inability to use policies
              like low taxation rates, which the much more successful IDA in the
              South has been able to do.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the IDB’s job is not made any easier
              by massaging figures to reflect better performance or by making
              grossly inflated claims. Keeping accurate records, carrying out
              rational accounting and putting in place adequate monitoring
              practices all represent good housekeeping.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The IDB has received massive sums of public
              money. It has the largest budget within the Department of
              Enterprise, Trade and Investment. People are entitled to know what
              is being done with this money, how efficiently and successfully it
              is being used, and what improvements are going to be brought about
              within the IDB.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The resistance within the IDB over the years
              despite repeated studies and recommendations, be publicly
              accountable, to make positive changes, to institute rational
              accounting and monitoring methods is unacceptable. Furthermore, it
              leads one to wonder whether if the true cost of their activities
              were known, it would bring forth such public criticism as would
              convince those who hold the purse strings that some money which
              has gone to the IDB would be better spent elsewhere.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I ask the Assembly to vote in favour of this
              motion because one of the problems over the years has been the
              lack of accountability shown by the IDB.</p>

              tribute to the valuable work carried out by the Public Accounts
              Committee at Westminster over recent years. That work has been
              based on reports prepared by the Comptroller and Auditor General
              for Northern Ireland and by Mr&nbsp;John&nbsp;Dowdall and his
              staff in the Northern Ireland Audit Office. It has been their job
              to seek to ensure that Government Departments and their agencies
              fulfil their responsibilities to the taxpayer and that money voted
              by Parliament has been spent wisely and in a proper manner.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I know that Mr&nbsp;Dowdall and his staff have
              drawn the attention of Parliament to a number of instances where
              Departments have fallen short of this requirement. He will now
              carry out this important function for the Northern Ireland
              Assembly.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The independence of the Comptroller and Auditor
              General in exercising his functions is an essential element in the
              process of holding Northern Ireland Departments accountable to the
              taxpayer through elected representatives. Section 65 of the
              Northern Ireland Act 1998 provides that he shall not be subject to
              the direction or control of any Minister, Northern Ireland
              Department, or the Northern Ireland Assembly. Taking that into
              account, I wonder how wise it was, or what the Business Committee
              were thinking about, to even propose that this motion be debated
              here today.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Section 60(3) of the Northern Ireland Act 1998
              provides for Standing Orders to establish the Assembly’s Public
              Accounts Committee. The main statutory function of that Committee
              is to consider accounts and reports of the Comptroller and Auditor
              General laid before the Northern Ireland Assembly.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The remit of the Assembly’s Public Accounts
              Committee is strictly limited to the consideration of reports
              prepared by the Comptroller and Auditor General. Since the
              legislation makes it clear that he cannot be directed by the
              Assembly in exercising his functions, it follows that the Assembly
              cannot direct the Public Accounts Committee as the motion seeks to
              do.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We all have a number of concerns in relation to
              the report on the IDB’s performance. However, there is a clear
              procedure already. As the report was submitted by the Committee on
              Public Accounts, the next stage in the process would be for the
              Department of Finance and Personnel to respond by producing a
              memorandum of reply. That procedure is based on the principle
              that, in replying to reports of the Committee, the Government
              should provide considered responses to the recommendations, which
              must first be given to Parliament.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is a long-established procedure, and it
              will apply to any future reports to this Assembly by my Committee.
              Sir Reg&nbsp;Empey will undoubtedly want to carefully consider the
              issues raised in the report, and provide a measured response
              through the memorandum of reply. That reply is due to be completed
              next month. In those circumstances, Members should be aware that
              the Minister will not be able to respond at this stage to detailed
              issues in the report.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although my Committee awaits publication of the
              Department of Finance and Personnel memorandum with interest, it
              will be a response to the Committee of Public Accounts, and it
              will be for that Committee to decide if the response is
              acceptable. The Comptroller and Auditor General will of course
              monitor any undertakings given in that response and report to my
              Committee any concerns about their implementation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The recommendation of the Chairman of the
              Committee of Public Accounts that my Committee should keep a
              watching brief on this issue has already been drawn to the
              attention of Committee Members. The Assembly’s Public Accounts
              Committee, however, can only take this matter forward in the
              context of any future Northern Ireland Audit Office reports on the
              work of the IDB. My contention is that we cannot be directed by
              this motion.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dallat:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to pick up on what Mr Bell has
              said. If we are not directed, I hope that at least we will be
              influenced. That is what is important. As Chairperson of the Audit
              Committee and a member of the Public Accounts Committee, I welcome
              the report referred to in the motion. The under-performance of the
              IDB is an issue which the Public Accounts Committee will, in time,
              have to take on board as part of a programme of work which is
              already under review. I have before me the business for next
              Wednesday, which deals with road safety in a very comprehensive
              way — one of the major issues concerning Northern Ireland at the
              moment.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Public Audit Office’s function is to
              ensure that the Assembly gets value for money. That is achieved by
              providing the Assembly with independent information and advice
              about how economically, efficiently and effectively Departments
              and agencies and other bodies use their resources.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The public auditor also gives help to audited
              bodies on how to improve their performance to achieve value for
              money. Clearly the Assembly’s Public Accounts Committee must be
              concerned that the IDB achieved its annual targets for job
              promotion in only four of the nine years under review. There will
              be concern too about the number of jobs that remained in place.
              The absence of a set of performance measures to demonstrate the
              relative and individual cost-effectiveness of the IDB’s overseas
              offices is perhaps one of the most alarming disclosures in the
              report. Clearly, a Government agency charged with inward
              investment and having no formal records of their performance is
              mind-boggling, to say the least.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a positive note, we welcome the IDB’s
              assurance that in future it will monitor the cost-effectiveness of
              its overseas offices and sector campaigns. However, it is
              essential that the weaknesses exposed in the IDB be taken on board
              by our Public Accounts Committee.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.15 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now, for the first time, we have a
              responsibility to ensure that the IDB delivers. The admission that
              it failed, over the nine-year period reviewed, to attract any
              inward investment to seven disadvantaged areas, including two
              areas of social need, is alarming. The further disclosure that the
              IDB has only begun to monitor the impact of inward investment on
              disadvantaged areas is also a cause for concern. Without
              pre-empting the findings of the Public Accounts Committee, I have
              no doubt that the IDB will be asked to ensure that what it
              promises is delivered.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now that the Public Accounts Committee is up
              and running, I, as Chairman of the Audit Committee, hope that
              there will be opportunities to scrutinise the work of all
              Government Departments with a view to improving performance. That
              includes value for money. As Chairman of the Audit Committee, I
              can report that there have been several formal and informal
              meetings with the Comptroller and Auditor General, at which my
              Vice-Chairman, Mr&nbsp;Billy&nbsp;Hutchinson, has also been
              present. A meeting of the Audit Committee was held last week, and
              another is scheduled for Tuesday. The Public Accounts Committee
              meets on Wednesday.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, I take this opportunity to assure the
              House that the Comptroller and Auditor General is not only able
              but willing to deal with this and with any other issue that
              Members feel is of concern. It is a developing process. Resources
              are obviously limited, but I am impressed by the high standards to
              which the Northern Ireland Audit Office operates. The draft
              programme of work already agreed by the Public Accounts Committee
              is impressive and will make a significant impact on how the
              Assembly delivers on its responsibilities for efficiency, value
              for money and fairness. As time goes by, new and fresh ideas will
              emerge from the scrutiny responsibilities of the Northern Ireland
              Audit Office that will result in joined-up government, bringing
              many benefits to the people of Northern Ireland. I do not accept
              that the Assembly has no role to play. The Public Accounts
              Committee has a critical and evolving role to play on this issue
              and on many others that will emerge in time.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Paisley Jnr:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The House of Commons Committee’s report on
              the IDB is an indictment of the failure of the IDB, over the
              medium term, to make a significant and lasting impact on job
              creation, employment and investment in the Province. The report is
              littered with serious criticisms of the board’s practices in
              attracting investment and its inability to cope with market
              demands and provide accurate information about its own activities.
              Without saying so openly, the report practically calls the IDB a
              failure. It is heavily peppered with criticisms such as</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;A substantial proportion of jobs promised
              were not, in fact, created&quot;,</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;taxpayers’ money is put at risk&quot;,</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;we are most dissatisfied with the
              provision by IDB of misleading information.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It also says that the IDB’s overseas offices
              secured no new projects, despite spending £80&nbsp;million.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is a catalogue of shame and long-term
              disaster. We are indebted to the House of Commons for pulling no
              punches. They have given us a wake-up call. If the IDB does not
              buck itself up, the situation will get worse. It is now for the
              Minister, Sir&nbsp;Reg&nbsp;Empey, to respond to the detailed and
              serious recommendations in this report and say what his Department
              is going to do to repair the damage and ensure that the future of
              the IDB is a success.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It would be easy to come to the House, give the
              IDB a good kicking, shout &quot;Hurray&quot; and walk away, but if
              the House is really serious about improving investment,
              opportunity and employment in Northern Ireland, it will take a
              different approach. Pious hand-washing and condemning while doing
              nothing is of no use.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is in all of our interests for the IDB to
              become a success story as a result of this report rather than
              wallow in its failures. Because of the way in which the motion was
              brought forward, we will not be supporting it. Nor do we believe
              that it can be supported. The motion has been pre-empted by the
              recommendations of the report itself. If the Member who moved the
              motion had read the report, she would have seen that the House of
              Commons commended it to the Public Accounts Committee of the
              Northern Ireland Assembly for continuing attention. That has
              already happened, and it is being considered by the PAC in
              Northern Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sinn Féin/IRA has shot itself in the foot by
              bringing this motion forward. It is loathsome in the extreme that
              IRA/Sinn Féin has the audacity to criticise the Industrial
              Development Board. Yes, the IDB’s record is poor and the IDB
              must improve itself. But at least the IDB, misguided though it has
              been, had the best interests of Northern Ireland at heart.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That can certainly not be said of IRA/Sinn
              Fein. Not only has it detracted from investment by its long-term
              bombing campaign, but it has shot industrialists, extorted money
              from building and investment programmes, done untold damage to
              Northern Ireland’s public-relations schemes, and killed workers.
              It boasted to the world that its ambition was to destroy Northern
              Ireland, and now it comes here and criticises the IDB for doing a
              terrible job. Despite IRA/Sinn Fein the IDB tried to make a good
              job of things. If the situation were not so serious, the inverted
              evil of Sinn Fein would be a joke, as I think most Members on this
              side of the House would agree.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This report by the House of Commons says that
              the disadvantaged areas of Northern Ireland must now become
              priority investment areas. It singles out two specific areas —
              one in Mid Ulster and the other in my constituency of North
              Antrim. The report urges the IDB to attract investment to North
              Antrim — to Moyle in particular. I hope that the Minister will
              respond to this positively. In the report an amazing excuse is
              given by the IDB to the House of Commons. It claimed that it was
              unable to attract investment to the Moyle area because the
              location was bad. Only the IDB would dare to say that the Causeway
              coast, which has a major research university on its doorstep and a
              young well-educated workforce, is not a suitable area for
              investment. This is especially the case since the IDB owns sites
              less then 10&nbsp;miles from Moyle in the Ballymoney area, and we
              could indeed have major investments there. The IDB refused to
              invest in the Moyle area despite the fact that there are excellent
              opportunities there and 10·6% unemployment.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that, as a result of this report, the
              Minister will prompt the IDB to develop a strategy for investment
              in that area — a strategy that will encourage inward investment
              and also encourage indigenous employers to develop and act
              positively for the whole area. If we are to attract disadvantaged
              people into employment such a strategy must be created. However,
              we are not going to pre-empt the Minister who, we hope, will be
              able to respond positively on these issues.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The reality is that the IDB dropped its
              ambitions because of the problems it faced as a result of
              terrorism. As a House we must encourage the IDB to lift its eyes
              again to get a vision and to create a strategy for investment
              which is both ambitious and achievable. We all understand the
              terrible blight that terrorism has inflicted on Northern Ireland,
              but the IDB cannot keep using that as an excuse. Rather, it will
              be judged on its ability to overcome the additional problems
              associated with Northern Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not believe that the Belfast Agreement has
              made things much better in terms of public relations. I have
              spoken to industrialists, and I am sure that many of them look
              cautiously at investment in Northern Ireland when they consider
              that one of the Ministers of the Crown is also a godfather of
              IRA/Sinn Féin.</p>

              ramifications for Northern Ireland. The reality is that investors
              and industrialists have spoken to me about their concerns. They
              have made statements in the press that they will look cautiously
              at Northern Ireland, given that one of the Ministers of the Crown
              is also a godfather of Provisional IRA/Sinn Féin. That is a fact.
              It is something that people might not like to be said in the
              House, but it has to be said if we are going to be honest about
              achieving investment in Northern&nbsp;Ireland. At the weekend I
              was reading a book written by Eamonn&nbsp;Mallie and
              Patrick&nbsp;Bishop. I was refreshing my memory — it stated,
              with specific regard to the long-term investment problems in
              Northern Ireland, that in 1976 the IRA army council gave its
              approval to the new Northern command. One of its leaders was, of
              course, Mr&nbsp;McGuinness, our Minister of Education. Mallie goes
              on to say that the first action of Northern command was</p>

              criticise the IDB when its leading members organised the campaign
              that made the work of the IDB doubly difficult for all those
              years. The proposer of this motion should hang her head in shame.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The IDB headquarters in Belfast was bombed by
              this crowd over here — IRA/Sinn Féin — in the early days of
              the troubles, in some of the first actions of Northern command.
              Now it has the audacity to condemn the IDB. The IDB has been
              sweeping up the results of bomb attacks on its own offices, so it
              is little wonder that it has had difficulty attracting investment
              into the Province. Yes, the IDB could have done better, and it did
              back the wrong horses at times. Some of the examples in this
              report about Hualon and other companies clearly indicate that, but
              the reality is that the IDB’s job was made doubly difficult by
              this crowd over here — Sinn&nbsp;Féin.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This report indicates that the IDB spends, in
              real terms, almost £40,000 per job. That is an astounding figure,
              given that less than 50% of the investment proposals are
              successful. I hope that the IDB and LEDU can, together, come up
              with a strategy that will allow more money to be spent on LEDU
              projects — instead of vast sums going to create short-term jobs,
              some of which last less than 10 years. LEDU projects give
              indigenous companies the opportunity to pay and increase their
              workforce and to develop indigenous employment. Indigenous
              employers stay here longer because they have a long-term
              commitment to the Province.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that the Minister will take up the
              recommendations and ensure that the very detailed criticisms made
              of the IDB in this report are responded to thoroughly. We look
              forward to the House of Commons continuing to monitor the IDB. A
              number of recommendations have come to my attention. I have skited
              over some of them briefly already. Recommendation&nbsp;8 urges the
              IDB to attract investment to</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;disadvantaged areas … and those
              locations which have enjoyed little or no such investment in the
              past&quot;.</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We know where those locations are, and I hope
              that they will attract successful investments in the future.
              Projects should be matched to areas of unemployment. In my
              constituency, Moyle has 10·6% unemployment. Moyle and Ballymoney
              should attract an investment programme. In the last 10&nbsp;years
              there has not been one successful investment in the Ballymoney
              area. That is alarming, given the fact that the IDB holds great
              swaths of land in that part of the Province.</p>
              <i>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is essential that indigenous companies be
              given the opportunity to develop. If the IDB cannot attract
              industrialists and inward investment, then let it encourage local
              companies to invest in the Province and make a success of things.
              Yes, the IDB has had a difficult job. Yes, this report indicts it
              for some startling failures, but the reality is that Sinn Feín/IRA
              bears a great deal of the responsibility for the major problems
              faced by investors in this Province. On that basis, we will
              certainly not be associated with a Sinn Féin motion on this
              issue.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Neeson:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am somewhat surprised that this motion is
              before the House today, for it is out of order, and the Business
              Committee must bear some responsibility for that. It is important
              to bear in mind though that the report is very alarming and should
              be taken seriously indeed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A number of issues need to be addressed by the
              IDB, but I regret that we have not yet heard its response to the
              report. Convention at Westminster allows a period to respond, and
              that period is not up. As Deputy Chairman of the Enterprise, Trade
              and Investment Committee, I was looking forward to having the IDB
              before the Committee to answer the criticisms made in the report
              and to answer my questions and those of my Colleagues.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clearly, there are issues which need to be
              addressed, but we have to also accept that we are living in a time
              of change. This report was drawn up for the years 1988-97. The
              ceasefires had not been declared, and there was a very unstable
              environment in Northern Ireland. I hope that the announcement made
              this morning about the arms dumps will give us the confidence that
              will enable us to create a stable environment with increased
              opportunities for attracting inward investment and creating more
              indigenous jobs. Those are the opportunities that need to be
              grasped.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are currently looking at the document ‘Strategy
              2010’. One of the issues that it raises which is very pertinent
              to the report is that of tax incentives. My party has consistently
              argued that the Assembly should have tax-varying and tax-raising
              powers. Until that happens, we will be running behind our nearest
              neighbours in the Irish Republic, particularly on corporation tax.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I tend to agree with the Member on corporation
              tax. However, the tax-varying issue has been part of the Member’s
              party’s policy since 1997, yet it has failed to deliver. Why was
              there no successful House of Commons or House of Lords amendment
              to the 1998 Bill that would have given this House tax-varying
              powers like those of the Scottish Parliament?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Neeson:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I regret that our point has not yet been
              accepted, but I hope that it will be seriously considered by all
              parties concerned when we come to review the agreement.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must also bear in mind the positive side of
              the IDB: 86,000 people are currently employed in Northern Ireland
              because of IDB ventures. These issues must be taken on board as
              well.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to make two final points.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairman of the Committee and I had a
              meeting with the Minister recently, and he raised the point about
              reductions in the ETI budget — what was then the DED budget —
              over the years. I fully concur with him that there are
              opportunities for inward investment there as a result of the new
              environment, and I think it is vitally important that the budget
              should not be reduced, regardless of the pressures that come from
              elsewhere.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally — and this is no criticism of Mr
              Billy Bell — I wish to reiterate the point that the Chairperson
              of the Public Accounts Committee at Westminster comes from the
              Opposition, and I still believe that it is morally wrong that the
              Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee of this Assembly should
              come from a party that is included in the Executive.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Birnie:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I too welcome the recent publication of the PAC
              report. It is obviously going to be of great interest to many of
              our constituents. However, now is not the time for a full-scale
              debate. Such a debate can properly be held after a formal response
              to the report following the due procedures as outlined by the
              Chairman of our Public Accounts Committee, as said in Parliament.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To borrow — rather, adapt — one of
              Shakespeare’s phrases, I am speaking neither to praise the IDB
              nor to bury it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What we can do is highlight a number of issues
              which this House can subsequently carefully evaluate. We can start
              by looking at several things which can be said in defence of the
              IDB’s record. The first point has already been put quite well by
              the Member from North Antrim. Obviously the actuality of violence
              and the threat of violence over the last 30&nbsp;or so years has
              been a very big factor in explaining why Northern Ireland’s
              record, and latterly the record of the IDB in terms of job
              creation, has not reached that of its counterpart in the Republic
              of Ireland or, indeed, those of the comparable agencies in Wales
              and Scotland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All parties in this House must recognise that
              point. The second thing which can be said in defence of the IDB’s
              position is that it is very easy for ourselves as elected
              representatives to demand that jobs and factories be put in
              certain places. I could, for example, note the finding in the PAC
              report that the Greater Belfast’s share of inward investment has
              been only roughly half of its share of unemployment. It is easy
              for all of us to do that and demand that jobs come to certain
              localities. However, we need to recognise that we work in the
              context of a market economy and there are distinct limits on the
              extent to which the state can order companies to go to this
              village or that village, or that county or locality. We are not
              dealing with some of sort of Stalinist system of central planning,
              nor indeed are we attempting to go back to the heyday of so-called
              indicative planning, which was tried in Northern Ireland during
              the 1960s and to some extent failed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In subsequent Assembly consideration of the PAC
              report we will obviously need to take on board the various areas
              of concern which it raises, the first being the very large
              discrepancy between the promotion of jobs and the actual creation
              of jobs on the ground. This is nothing new. As the mover of the
              motion noted, a variety of reports, including those done by the
              Northern Ireland Economic Council, have been pointing this out
              over the years. Secondly, we obviously need to look at the cost
              per job, and that must include all of the costs of promotion as
              the PAC report has outlined.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thirdly, there is the whole issue of targeting
              social need. To what extent have jobs actually gone to TSN areas?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to jobs in TSN areas, how far do
              the people who took those jobs live from the TSN areas? Linked to
              this, and to a point that I made earlier, there is inevitably a
              trade-off, a difficult balance, that has to be struck. We can
              attempt to skew the location of jobs, but if we do so, efficiency
              suffers and the costs to the Exchequer rise. And that is public
              money which could be used more profitably in other ways to combat
              poverty. We need to look at that balance.</p>

              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, when the House comes to consider this
              report and the long-term performance of the IDB formally we will
              need to do so in context — and it is a worrying context. I think
              it was Mr&nbsp;Neeson who made reference to ‘Strategy 2010’.
              It is of great concern that in ‘Strategy 2010’ there was no
              critical evaluation, in any real sense, of the work of the IDB.
              Some commentators would say that that was not an accident. The way
              in which the former Department of Economic Development structured
              ‘Strategy 2010’ and the composition of its steering committee
              were quite deliberately designed to shield the IDB from the type
              of critical evaluation that, over the years, has been given to the
              work of the IDA in Dublin or similar agencies in, for example,
              Edinburgh and Cardiff.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the spirit of the motion, yet,
              because of the qualifications relating to procedure, which were
              properly raised by my Colleague Mr Bell, I cannot vote for it.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member has just made comment about
              procedural issues that were raised by the Chairman of the Assembly’s
              Public Accounts Committee and a number of other Members. I need to
              make a ruling in this regard.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, in producing its report the Public
              Accounts Committee at Westminster requires the IDB to respond
              within a period. That is clearly laid down, and it may well be
              that the Minister’s response will be limited by the IDB’s
              having to make some necessary enquiries before responding to the
              PAC at Westminster.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is wholly different from the assumption
              that the Assembly is not entitled to consider this matter and
              respond under the terms of the motion. Some people across the
              water do not yet understand the impact of devolution and what this
              Assembly, and the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly, can
              and cannot do. It seems that that is also the case even in this
              Chamber.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Public Accounts Committee’s report on the
              IDB is a public document, and anyone can comment on it. However,
              the IDB has a particular responsibility to do so and will respond
              within the necessary time. That is a ministerial responsibility,
              but the Assembly is entitled to debate a public document and to
              express its view, and that is what it is properly doing.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That that view might be taken into account by
              the IDB and the Public Accounts Committee at Westminster is not
              unreasonable, but it is proper for the Assembly to debate this
              matter, and I rule that the motion is competent.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In general recommendation xix of the PAC report
              it is recognised that the Public Accounts Committee of the
              Northern Ireland Assembly should attend to the matters raised and
              give its continuing attention to them post-devolution. We are in a
              transitional period, and there may be questions about whether the
              Public Accounts Committee at Westminster will retain a right to
              address cases of substantial expenditure.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There may also be questions about procedures
              for this Assembly’s Public Accounts Committee and what matters
              it may or may not deal with, but those are entirely separate
              issues. Members should not hold back from expressing their views
              on this publicly available document. Subsequently there will have
              to be some understanding between the devolved Assemblies and
              Westminster, on a convention basis, I suspect, as to how deeply
              things are considered, but this Chamber has the right to continue
              to debate this motion. It is a competent motion.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have already made it my practice when the
              Assembly adopts motions which relate to business elsewhere — the
              recent motion on the Postal Services Bill is an example — to
              forward the matter to the relevant Minister, with the Official
              Report, so that due consideration can be given to the views of the
              Assembly. That is proper practice, and I intend to do the same
              with regard to this matter. I felt that it was important to make
              this ruling. Without clarification, much of the debate might end
              up nugatory.</p>

              convention that when the House of Commons commends a report to
              this House, we consider it on the basis that it has been commended
              to us? If that is the case, we are today establishing convention,

              has agreed to consider this report on foot of a motion brought
              forward by Dr O’Hagan. That is an entirely proper thing to do.
              My clarification is that procedurally it is entirely correct to do
              so within the boundaries set out in our Standing Orders, in the
              motion itself and in relationships that are already established.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It may be that this will quickly become a

              traditional routes. This process might quickly become a

              thing in either circumstance, but it is there, it is proper, and
              if the Assembly takes the view that it should debate such matters,

              the appropriate time to debate the issue, or that this is the
              appropriate manner? That is a different issue, though it does not

              that one cannot have recurring debates on the same question,
              Members cannot assume that an opportunity for further debate will
              arise. That is an entirely different matter.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Further to that point of order, Mr Speaker. I
              recognise, appreciate and accept your ruling with regard to the
              competence of the House to debate the issue before us. Does your
              ruling also extend to the directive that is involved in the motion
              — namely, that the Assembly is going on to direct the Northern
              Ireland Assembly Public Accounts Committee?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is entirely proper for the Assembly to
              direct that a Committee give attention to a matter. That is what
              this motion suggest — that the Northern Ireland Assembly Public
              Accounts Committee give continuing attention to the issues raised
              in the report. It is entirely proper that the Committee should do
              that. How it chooses to give that attention, and whether it might
              attend positively or negatively to all those matters, is a wholly
              different question.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The terms of the motion make it clear that it
              is not something that can simply be ignored. The Assembly’s
              Public Accounts Committee may make its own judgements about
              precisely how it attends to the matter. It may agree or disagree
              with all of it. The motion is simply directing that the Committee
              pay attention to it. That seems to be a competent thing to do.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There may well be a procedural question — a
              question of Standing Orders — as to whether the Northern Ireland
              Assembly Public Accounts Committee may have wider or lesser powers
              extended to it within the requirements of the Act. That is another
              matter. However, this is a competent motion.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker, I appreciate your outlining the
              position of the Business Committee. As a member of that Committee
              I think we were coming under flak from parties whose Whips sat in
              the same room and did not complain. The point was that the
              Committee took a decision that the motion was competent and
              brought it forward to the Floor of the House.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr McClelland] in the
              Chair)</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Neeson said that during the period covered
              by the report — 1988-97 — there was still a lot of violence
              and that this affected the level of inward investment. I am sure
              that, on reading the report and noting the issues that must have
              raised for the Public Accounts Committee, everybody in this House,
              including the Minister responsible, would be concerned. We can
              talk about violence affecting jobs here for the last 30 years.
              However, if we look at the record of inward investment we see that
              there were foreign companies here well before the ceasefires were
              in place. They did not seem to have much of a problem.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need to look at the reasons the IDB cannot
              respond or has not done so. The hon Member for North Antrim said
              that the IDB had backed a few wrong horses. If I had backed as
              many wrong horses as the IDB I would be looking to find out the
              number of Gamblers Anonymous. It makes mistake after mistake after
              mistake.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the levels of violence in the
              past and job creation, a number of places — for instance, Antrim
              — have done very well for inward investment. It is not that far
              from north Belfast or from other places where there has been
              conflict, but we still could not attract jobs to those areas. I do
              not necessarily believe that that argument holds.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My argument is about the way taxpayers’ money
              was spent. In some cases great risks were taken with that money,
              and it did not deliver jobs. The records of the IDB and LEDU
              indicate that the lifespans of the jobs they create are about 3.8
              years and 4.2 years. This is about the length of time the grants
              last. People continually talk about a benefit culture. We have got
              into a grants culture and a benefit culture for inward investment.
              We need to look at better ways of doing this.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A number of Members have pointed out that we
              have not done so well for indigenous companies. I would like to
              see us taking the same risk for indigenous companies as we have
              taken for the IDB. One thing is for sure: the indigenous companies
              are going nowhere; they are from here, and they are based here.
              Most of them started out as family businesses and have grown. We
              should be making sure they grow even bigger.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is not to say that we do not want to see
              inward investment. Of course we do. It would be madness for this
              House to suggest that we do not. We want to create an IDB that
              performs much better. Take its performance overseas. Any of us who
              have been on trips abroad and have talked to people in foreign
              cities will know that the IDB could perform a lot better.
              Everybody knows that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have met industrialists who say that if they
              wanted to come here, the last people they would even talk to are
              those in the IDB. That has nothing to do with the people who work
              there; rather it has to do with the way it operates and the rules
              and regulations that restrict it. Those are the things that we
              need to change. I am convinced that the people who work there can
              perform at a better level. We need to ensure that the Minister is
              given support from the Committees and from the Floor of this House
              in finding the best way forward.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need to focus on how we give them the tools
              to bring the jobs here. We will not solve the problem by talking
              continually about IRA bombs and murders by loyalist
              paramilitaries, and so on. We must live in the real world and look
              at how to get jobs into the areas that most need them. The best
              thing to do is focus on this report, see what the problems are and
              try to correct them.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is not about kicking the IDB or anyone
              else. It is about having a debate, because a number of our
              constituents are concerned. People out there looking for jobs
              cannot get them, and they are asking questions about people here.
              Let us look at the number of jobs the IDB announces. It will tell
              us tomorrow that 1,500 jobs are going to appear on a particular
              site. Do we ever see 1,500 jobs? No. Those are the sorts of things
              we need to get to grips with. Why do we continually raise
              expectations? All this reflects badly on the IDB. If we were to
              look at the number of jobs it said it was bringing and then at the
              number of jobs it actually brought, it would be a very bad picture
              indeed.</p>

              which I agree. As a member of the Business Committee, I wanted to

              these very matters. Having met sufficient of the industrialists
              who deal with these matters, the hon Member knows as well as I
              that we need to put such things in place. If we do not have them
              we shall not be able to perform at the necessary level to give
              confidence to taxpayers and Members of this Assembly representing
              those people.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need to make sure that we support Dr&nbsp;Dara

              irrespective of where. However, I should like to make sure we get
              them in TSN areas. Those jobs would be extremely valuable to the

              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr McDonnell:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the report and the debate on the
              issues it raises. It is not appropriate to go backwards. We could
              use this occasion to hurl abuse and poke each other in the eye.
              However, if we did that we would undermine the very basis of
              confidence our economy requires. I should like to think anything
              we do in this House gives support to the Minister and the IDB in
              their considerable efforts to ensure we get the economy we desire,
              for it is the engine that will provide for all our social
              spending. If we do not have a healthy, strong economy, we shall
              not in the long term have the funds for the Health Service and the
              top-class education system to which we aspire.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am equally concerned that some of my
              Colleagues’ comments highlighted the risks involved. We must be
              clear that part of the problem with our economy has been that we
              have been averse to risk. Perhaps the IDB has been taking the
              wrong risks, or taking the right risks in the wrong places. I am
              not sure, and it will take some time to tease out the detail.
              However, I wish to make it quite clear that it is essential that
              we be prepared to take risks in the long term, for otherwise we
              shall not succeed.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.00 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is the big difference between our economy
              and the American economy. Those who succeed in America are those
              who take risks. In the United States people go bankrupt one, two,
              three, four times, yet on the fifth they may come up with an
              outstanding success. The cutting edge of technological
              developments, whether it be in information and communication
              technology, multi-media or biotechnology, requires risk. Venture
              capital is also important. If venture capitalists achieve one
              winner out of 10, they feel all right; if they achieve two out of
              10, they feel successful. We do not need to run like lemmings over
              a cliff on this. Certainly, there are issues involved, but we have
              to know the difference between taking responsible risks and taking
              irresponsible, reckless risks.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are glaring mistakes and omissions in the
              report, as well as a lack of accountability. This must be
              corrected. That is different from taking risks. We must refocus,
              re-energise and ensure that all our efforts go towards developing
              our economy to the maximum. We should not talk down the examples
              of success and the good work done at times by the IDB in difficult
              circumstances, but the underperformance and misinformation
              mentioned in this report will not do anyone any favours if we are
              to create a healthy economic environment, one in which
              entrepreneurship and economic prosperity flourish.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A great deal of work still needs to be done on
              ‘Strategy 2010’. It was hailed initially as being the be-all
              and end-all, but gradually we have come to realise that ‘Strategy
              2010’ was only the beginning of a process. We must now ensure
              that we are all singing from the same hymn sheet, that we are all
              marching together in the same direction, and that we are all
              broadly agreed — maybe not in every detail — on what we are
              doing, and where we are trying to go.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am concerned about false figures and
              headlines that provide jobs that are not delivered. These serious
              inaccuracies lead to cynicism of, and disinterest in, any
              publicity or announcements that the IDB makes. Many of the jobs it
              has announced in the past were temporary and short-lived.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are also the issues of
              cost-effectiveness, the measurement of the function of the
              overseas offices and project appraisal. Having gone through the
              various recommendations that emerged, I believe that immediate and
              urgent pressure must be brought to bear on our own Public Accounts
              Committee, the Department, and the Minister, to ensure that when
              jobs have been promised, there is a reasonable chance that they
              will be created, and that if they are short-term or part-time
              jobs, that is made clear.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am seriously concerned about the creative
              accountancy that is involved, suggestions regarding some of the
              costs that were attributed to jobs but not included, and the cost
              of some of the overseas offices. The report mentions using the
              Internet. Could a strong case not be made for scaling down some of
              the overseas offices, utilising an Internet system and mobile
              support unit, based at home but which could respond when and where
              it was needed? There must be ways and means of ensuring that our
              job promotion operation is cost-effective and efficient. These are
              the issues highlighted by the proposer of the motion today. The
              motion is down because we need to take account of it. I welcome
              the ruling from Mr&nbsp;Speaker that set the parameters. It is
              entirely appropriate for the House to discuss this and, indeed,
              for the Business Committee to put it on the agenda.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would welcome a more comprehensive
              opportunity later for a debate on many of the issues raised.
              Nevertheless, the point I want to emphasise is that there is a
              desperate need — if we are to go forward with a healthy and
              expanding economy, particularly in the field of new technology —
              for honesty, openness and transparency, balanced with the need not
              to talk ourselves into a corner or into a loss of confidence. We
              must learn from the serious mistakes highlighted in the Public
              Accounts Committee’s report. We need to put those right and go
              forward steadily, gaining the broad support and confidence of the
              community. If the IDB and Department of Enterprise, Trade and
              Investment do not have public support at home, they are unlikely
              to be able to sell themselves and Northern&nbsp;Ireland abroad.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, I want to raise one of my hobby
              horses, which may not be appropriate to the Public Accounts
              Committee or the issue at stake. My concern is that the IDB has
              not managed — I will not put it any stronger — to come to
              terms fully with the whole swath of new technology. While we do
              have some involvement in communication technology, perhaps it is
              at the lower end of the market. I would welcome much closer
              attention to information and communication technology; movement
              and effort on biotechnology, particularly in the fields of life
              and health sciences, and closer attention to the emerging
              multimedia opportunities where growth is currently at 37% per
              annum. Perhaps we have been a little shy and reserved about
              grappling with some of the opportunities that lie therein.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am broadly in support of the motion. It is
              only right that we should debate the issues raised, as they are
              pertinent to all of us. In doing so, we should not throw the baby
              out with the bathwater. We should be constructive in our criticism
              to ensure that we retain the credibility and strength to go along.
              It would be disastrous if we were to do ourselves damage in
              discussion.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to pick up on what Mr&nbsp;Hutchinson
              said about the need for the IDB to start taking serious risks for
              indigenous companies. It is essential that there is a balance
              between attracting inward investment such as the high-tech models
              from outside and supporting local industry. I am keen to ensure
              that the IDB does not close its door on things that Northern
              Ireland is famous for, such as the textile industry. I would like
              to see the IDB and the economic advisors take a strategic approach
              to restructuring the textile industry here. I would also like to
              see greater support for and innovation and research and
              development in successful areas such as our &quot;clean, green
              image&quot; food processing. That would allow us to capitalise on
              what we do well. Those issues will be important to feed into the
              review of economic development here and the role of the IDB.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We recognise the importance of providing
              support for new hi-tech industries, such as call centres and
              financial centres, but we need to ensure that when support is
              given to these new industries, the jobs that are created are
              properly contracted and secure jobs. We do not want to be used as
              a back door for cheap labour. The need for secure jobs is
              highlighted by the recent announcement by British Telecom that it
              is going to move its BT Cellnet operations to England. More than
              200 jobs could be lost in Belfast if that happens, and I am hoping
              that the IDB is taking this on board and doing something about it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In recent meetings with IDB officials we have
              noted that the situation appears to be improving. I have seen
              serious attempts to inform and brief Assembly Members and others
              about their work. We hope that the new political climate in
              Northern Ireland will make the work of the IDB less important as
              foreign investors queue up to put their money in what will
              undoubtedly become the perfect place in the world, and certainly
              in Europe, to invest.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Colleague from North Antrim has already made
              clear our decision on this motion, but I want to re-emphasise the
              point. We oppose this motion not simply because we are unhappy
              with the procedure, as described by Mr Bell. We are unhappy about
              its source.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am especially unhappy about what I believe to
              be the real motivation behind it — namely, an attempt by
              IRA/Sinn Féin to rewrite the history of the last 30 years. We are
              going to be subjected every week, I suspect, to the nauseating
              spectacle of Sinn Féin Members bringing forward motions to show
              how concerned they are about the ordinary issues which affect
              people on a day-to-day basis, while ignoring the fact that they
              have been partly responsible, and sometimes completely so, for
              causing the very problems to which they are now drawing attention.
              Last week we had Mr McHugh lamenting — <i>[Interruption]</p>
              </i><b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Wilson, it would be useful if you were to
              restrict your comments to this report.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr S Wilson:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I think they have been restricted to the
              motion. I do not know if you want instant gratification or whether
              you are prepared to allow me to lead up to the point I want to
              make.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Last week we had a debate on the closure of
              post offices. For the past 30 years post offices have been held up
              and bombed. Postmasters and postmistresses have been killed. Yet
              Sinn&nbsp;Féin was concerned last week about the decline in the
              number of post offices. And today it is jobs.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.15 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For 30 years the job of the IDB has been made
              practically impossible by the destructive actions of members of
              IRA/Sinn Féin. I remember, in another place, a member of the
              party opposite proudly proclaiming that they would demolish
              Belfast brick by brick. Then they complain about social
              disadvantage and no jobs. They point the finger at the IDB when
              its problem was caused by IRA/Sinn Féin’s economic warfare
              against the people of this Province.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first reason we are opposed to this motion
              is that it would give credibility to the hypocrisy and
              two-facedness of its authors. Having said that, I should point out
              that the report does list some valid concerns which need to be
              highlighted here today — concerns which hold for the Assembly in
              dealing with civil servants from various bodies. I want to
              emphasise the points made by Alasdair&nbsp;McDonnell and
              Ian&nbsp;Paisley that this is not an exercise in bashing the IDB,
              although the report does point us to what needs to be done to make
              sure that government in Northern Ireland is made more accountable.
              The Assembly and its Committees can learn from that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another concern is the lack of information. The
              report stated in paragraph 5 (xii) that the PAC was dissatisfied
              with the IDB provision of misleading information on the write-off
              costs of the Hualon Project. That failure to provide accurate
              information is unacceptable. We must stress that it is incumbent
              upon all witnesses who appear before the Committees to ensure they
              are properly briefed on the subject being examined. I do not
              believe this is unique to the IDB. A few weeks ago, on the
              Education Committee, we could have said the same about officials
              who came along from the Department of Education and who, I
              believe, treated the House, through the Education Committee, with
              utter contempt. This is endemic, because after 30 years of direct
              rule, civil servants have not been used to the level of scrutiny
              they would have had in other parts of the United Kingdom or in
              other democracies in the world. This warning to the IDB officials
              should be treated as a general warning to the Civil Service as a
              whole.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is also a lack of information on the cost
              of overseas offices. We do not know what they cost. I tried to
              find the IDB on the Internet and it does not have a site. Here is
              a body which is supposedly promoting modern industry, to which the
              House of Commons has to commend the use of the Internet. It seems
              anachronistic that a body trying to promote high-tech jobs still
              relies on people using shoe leather to walk around the world — a
              fairly expensive walk, an £80 million walk.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I notice in the report a statement that I am
              sure will warm the Minister’s heart:</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;IDB needs to improve their ability to
              respond promptly, clearly and accurately.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It does not use the terminology we are used to
              in Northern Ireland, but the words are similar: &quot;clarity and
              certainty&quot;. We wish to see some clarity and certainty. Given
              the practice that the Minister has at seeking clarity and
              certainty and at getting clarity and certainty about the things
              that he has got clarity and certainty about, I am sure that we
              will get that clarity and certainty over the period of his
              stewardship of the IDB. It is appalling that the kind of basic
              information that the House of Commons would have sought was not
              available.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second matter is the failure to hit job
              targets. There is a need to keep tabs on the promises that are
              made. There is no point in the IDB giving grant aid to firms and
              getting promises of jobs. I understand that this cannot be totally
              accurate. Circumstances change, and sometimes technology changes.
              Markets change, and one cannot be absolutely certain that the job
              targets set will always be met. However, it is important that the
              Minister ensure that when targets are set, they are met. The
              Minister’s record, or at least that of his party, on having
              targets met has been appalling. I hope he will be more successful
              at getting job targets met than he is at getting the IRA’s
              targets on decommissioning met. That is an aside, but I hope he
              heard it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My last point is on disadvantaged areas. There
              are disadvantaged areas in nearly every constituency. Nobody can
              claim a monopoly on disadvantage. Some of that disadvantage, as I
              said earlier, has been self-imposed by people who have gone out of
              their way to make areas difficult for industrialists to invest in.
              We cannot pretend, as Esmond Birnie said, that the IDB can say to
              an industrialist &quot;Go there&quot;, and the industrialist will
              jump up and go there. The skills he needs must match those
              available in the area. Very often an industrialist will go where
              he can get support from similar industries and not be sitting in
              isolation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Certain areas have an image. I accept that it
              makes good economic sense to match areas of unemployment with job
              opportunities, but the other point made by the report is that
              often, when a firm locates in a particular area, it is not people
              from that area who get the jobs. It is not simply a case of saying
              &quot;There is a business, now you have to recruit from that local
              area.&quot; There is the complex business of training and making
              sure that people are available and have the skills that are
              required. Sometimes — I have had experience of this on Belfast
              City Council — where a firm gives advance notice of the numbers
              of people and the kinds of skills it is going to need, and there
              is a long lead-in period, it is possible to do that. At other
              times, it is not. It is unrealistic for the House to impose a
              burden on the Minister and on the IDB to deliver what may often be
              an unrealistic wish-list. It is important to address these issues,
              but it is also important to recognise that microeconomics does not
              always work so smoothly.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is an important report that generates a
              lot of work for the Assembly and the Department. As a result, I
              trust, we will see an improvement in the performance of the IDB.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairman of the Enterprise, Trade and
              Investment Committee (Mr P Doherty): </b>Cheann Comhairle. As
              Chairman of the Committee of Enterprise, Trade and Investment, and
              from the meetings<b> </b>I have had with the Minister, I am
              entirely aware of the convention which prevents the IDB from
              responding for eight<b>&nbsp;</b>weeks. To some degree this
              restricts the Minister in dealing both with the issue and with the
              responses. However, there have been numerous reports, going back
              to the 1980s, which outlined virtually the same problems. Even
              without these reports those people who live in areas of social
              need (they are scattered throughout the Six Counties —Fermanagh
              and Tyrone, for example) do not need reports to tell them that
              they do not have work. They do not need reports to tell them that
              they have been discriminated against. They do not need reports to
              tell them that society here — let us hope that it is changing
              — has been unequal.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since this Assembly was elected some
              two&nbsp;years ago I have held, sometimes on my own and sometimes
              with my party colleagues, a number of meetings with IDB officials
              to try to understand their concerns and to put our views across as
              forcefully as possible. I am not lightening or lessening my
              criticism of the IDB, but we need to look at the issues in a
              holistic way.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The concerns of the IDB generally involved the
              lack of infrastructure in some areas. There are historical and
              political reasons why the areas west of the Bann do not have
              infrastructure. We have a Minister for Regional Development who
              does not attend Executive meetings yet his fellow Members preach
              to us about political instability. He will have a role in helping
              the IDB to develop and expand into areas of social need and into
              those areas which have not as yet received the type of inward
              investment that they require. As we look forward to the future,
              the political instability is coming repeatedly from the same
              source — the people who will not attend, the people who will
              criticise and reject and defy any of the collective decisions that
              are being taken by the Executive. Perhaps we need a Select
              Committee at Westminster to investigate the denial that emanates
              continuously from the DUP. Maybe it would be enlightening with
              regard to its attitudes to us.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Focusing on the key point, I do support the
              proposal. The IDB has failed many, many areas. It needs to
              seriously consider the criticisms of the Westminster report and of
              the various other reports which have appeared on a regular basis.
              If the IDB focuses on these issues, and if it approaches the
              situation in a holistic way, then in a year’s time — or two
              years’ time — when we again discuss the IDB it will be
              developing and growing and we will be able to work in co-operation
              with it. If, however, it reverts to the old ways, the old in-house
              practices, we will again be criticising and focusing — perhaps
              on the basis of our own reports rather than those from Westminster
              — on its many, many failures.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today’s criticisms stand. They are absolutely
              clear. One would need to be totally incompetent not to recognise
              that those criticisms are well founded. We need to take on board
              these criticisms and look to the future. We need to develop a
              holistic approach, and there is an opportunity now for members of
              the Committee and for the Minister, with his new responsibilities,
              to take on board these concerns and to get it right. We need to
              get it right, particularly for the people on the ground who have
              suffered from the lack of inward investment.</p>

              are a number of special programmes designed specifically to help
              autistic children, and all special schools for children with
              severe learning difficulties operate structured provision to meet
              the needs of pupils with severe learning difficulties and autism.
              Education and library boards also provide specialised support to
              other schools with pupils with autism, and I am committed to
              achieving greater consistency in the level of such provision.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To assist in this, the Education and Training
              Inspectorate will shortly be issuing two reports on provision
              presently being made for autistic children. The first deals with
              provision for autistic children in special schools for pupils with
              severe learning difficulties, and the second is a survey of
              provision for children with Asperger syndrome, that is autistic
              children with normal or high intelligence. As I indicated in my
              statement of 5 June to the Assembly on the North/South Ministerial
              Conference held on 3 February, provision for pupils with autism is
              one of the priority areas for co-operation on a joint North/South
              basis through a special education co-ordination group that will
              examine the possibilities for the exchange of information and
              experience, and for commissioning joint research studies. I have
              also agreed with the United States Secretary of Education,
              Mr&nbsp;Richard Riley, that we can have access to American
              expertise and research in this area. Both initiatives will, I am
              sure, lead to significant improvements in the quality of provision
              for children with autism.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In mainstream schools, the operation of the
              special educational needs code of practice ensures that children’s
              needs can be picked up at different levels of intervention, from
              school-based to school-supported. Stage 3 intervention brings
              additional resources and advice from the education and library
              board, and the process of individual educational plans identifies
              targets and achievement dates for review. Children can have
              differing degrees of autism, and provision must have regard for
              the impact of the condition on the child’s learning and ability
              to work with peers. It can also change with age. For example, a
              child with Asperger syndrome will probably experience more
              emotional problems during adolescence — hence the need for
              individual support — and may have additional problems with
              examinations, as the nature of autism can inhibit some children
              from doing well.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Such children’s circumstances can be taken
              into account by the examining bodies, which will make special
              arrangements to meet their needs. Provision in mainstream schools
              therefore needs to be individualised and underpinned by a visual
              and structural approach. Support is now available from education
              and library boards, educational psychology services and their
              outreach and peripatetic services. Classroom assistance is also
              provided where necessary.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the consistency and provision across the
              education and library boards, I am aware that in special schools
              for children with moderate learning difficulties, and in the
              mainstream, provision for autistic children is not as consistent
              across the boards as we would like it to be. I expect the
              Inspectorate’s forthcoming reports to highlight this. There is a
              regional strategy group for special education and that comprises
              the special education officers and principal educational
              psychologists from all the education and library boards. It is
              chaired by a senior education officer and provides the appropriate
              forum to address this important issue. I will be charging the
              group with doing so. After the Education and Training Inspectorate
              have monitored their success in this regard and they will report
              back to me.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree that dyslexia is a serious problem. I
              am not sure that I would agree that it has not been resourced. My
              Department is very conscious of the need to deal in a
              serious-minded way with any children who have severe or medium
              learning difficulties. Since I came to the Department of Education
              I have made it clear to my officials that we must prioritise the
              issue of children with severe learning difficulties. I recently
              visited Rathfriland Hill School in Newry, and that brought home to
              me at first hand the great difficulties faced by the children and
              the teachers who look after them. We are aware of the seriousness
              of the issue. It is probably safe to say that approximately 10% of
              all school-going children suffer, in varying degrees, from
              dyslexia, and a considerable number also suffer from dyspraxia.
              That is a huge problem by any standards, and it is one which my
              officials and I, as Minister, take very seriously.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have always been of the view that the private

              need for a substantial school capital building programme in any
              given year. I have already raised this issue on several occasions,
              particularly in a number of interviews with the ‘Belfast
              Telegraph’. The Department of Education has been evaluating the
              experience gained during the pathfinder programme. As I announced
              earlier this year, we will be consulting with school authorities
              and the Assembly’s Education Committee on a more extensive
              programme of private finance initiative projects to be launched
              next year. The present school projects are part of the pathfinder
              programme. Further private finance initiative developments will be
              subject to additional consultation, and I expect that increasing
              numbers of people will be keenly interested in how we develop this
              particular aspect of our school capital building programme.</p>

              Has the Minister checked that satisfactory arrangements are in
              place for the care and maintenance of school buildings under PPP?
              Also, will those who will be employed in the care and maintenance
              of the schools, under these arrangements, enjoy the same terms and
              conditions as those employed in other schools?</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Obviously, value for money is vitally important
              to my Department. Given the condition of the schools estate I have
              to be seriously concerned as to how Department money is spent in
              relation to PFI. I have had in-depth discussions with departmental
              officials in relation to all of these matters, and we are
              conscious of the need to ensure that, over a twenty-five year
              period, we are getting value for money.</p>

              schemes will be treated, particularly as they will be within a

              admission criteria when a school is oversubcribed with applicants.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Department monitors the availabiltiy of
              grammar school places on an area basis, and not on an individual

              should be available in an area for all pupils obtaining grade A,
              and 80% of pupils obtaining grade B who are seeking grammar school
              places. The situation in Strabane is that grammar school places
              are available in Strabane, Derry and Omagh, and the general policy

              Therefore the school is almost full. There are plans for future
              capital development at the school, and the long-term enrolment

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for his brief and succinct
              response. Will he take on board a particular concern I have while
              those criteria are being reviewed? My understanding of the present
              situation is that when establishing the criteria for integrated
              schools, only the number of Protestants and Catholics are counted,
              and those of mixed background and others are ignored. Will the
              Minister acknowledge that this discrimination is increasing the
              hurdles to the establishment of new integrated schools, for which
              there is a huge parental demand, and that this is something that
              must be addressed in the review that is currently underway?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr M McGuinness:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am willing to address that issue in the
              review. In my time as Minister of Education, before suspension, I
              had a number of discussions with those in the integrated sector
              about this matter, and so it is something I am conscious of. Mr
              Ford knows as well as anyone that in relation to the development
              of these schools, it is absolutely essential to get the balance
              right. The current legislation clearly refers to reasonable
              numbers of Catholics and Protestants, but I know that there are
              people who fall between two stools, and we will take account of
              that.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Minister accept that he is using
              integrated primary schools as a cover for discriminatory behaviour
              in favour of Irish language schools? Given the fact that the
              Department of Education has closed primary schools in the
              controlled sector on the grounds that they were not educationally
              efficient — some of them with just fewer than 100 pupils —
              does he agree that it is absurd to suggest that the viability
              criterion for Irish language schools and integrated schools should
              be 12 pupils? Is it not a case of him plundering his budget once
              again for his Republican disciples rather than giving good quality
              for people?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr M McGuinness:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No, I do not agree at all. Mr Wilson would be
              surprised if I did.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Integrated primary schools must demonstrate the
              potential to achieve a minimum year one enrolment of 25 pupils and
              a minimum long-term potential enrolment in the range of 150 to 175
              pupils. Integrated secondary schools must demonstrate the
              potential to achieve a minimum year eight enrolment of 80 pupils
              with a minimum long-term enrolment of 400.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the moment, Irish medium schools must
              demonstrate over a two-year period their ability to meet the
              minimum requirements for annual intake. The review put in place by
              my Department is about meeting demand. When I became Minister of
              Education I made it clear that the issues of choice, accessibility
              and excellence were very important. The demand for Irish-medium
              and for integrated education is legitimate. It is fair to say
              that, over the years, people in both sectors felt very strongly
              that they were not being given a fair opportunity to develop these
              forms of education.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Department has a responsibility, under the
              terms of the Good Friday Agreement, to encourage integrated
              education and Irish medium education, and we will continue to do
              that. There is no question of my Department discriminating against
              any state school. If there are specific allegations that the
              Member wishes to make on the matter, the sensible thing to do is
              to sit down and have a discussion about it.</p>

              pupils, schools, teachers, parents and society and to act as a
              catalyst for a full and open debate on the issues. The report is
              not yet complete. It will be published in September. It will be
              followed by a series of dissemination seminars at which the
              researchers will present their findings. The arrangements for
              taking forward the subsequent debate and consultation will be
              determined shortly. However, I wish to ensure that all the
              relevant interests, including educational bodies, the Executive,
              the Assembly Education Committee and the Assembly, have full
              opportunity to contribute to our deliberations on the nature of

              any changes to the current transfer test will have on the
              education budget, particularly in relation to the school estate?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr M McGuinness:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is impossible to give that answer at this
              time. Clearly, my Department is focussing on the fact that we will
              have, through the research, which is currently with officials and
              which will be published in September, a huge body of work, to be
              finalised over the summer period. We will then have what
              conceivably will be one of the biggest debates in relation to
              education we have seen in 100 years. Before we even get to the
              issue of what type of structures are going to be required. We need
              to deal first with the research and the contents of that research.
              It is important to stress that this report will not make
              proposals. I firmly envisage our moving forward to examine the
              effects of selection, and the 11-plus in particular, on pupils,
              teachers, the community and society as a whole.</p>

              intervene in a ministerial answer on the subject of whether the
              Minister has answered the question when he is still on his feet.
              One should not forget that, if there is time, there will be
              supplementary questions.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr M McGuinness:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With respect, I believe I have answered Mr
              Kennedy’s question, and the answer was an honest one. I do not
              know what the financial implications will be, for the simple
              reason that we must first deal with how to handle the research
              findings and move forward to what, in my opinion, will be a large
              educational debate which, I hope, will take in all sections of the
              community and everyone involved in the education of our children.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the research, after it has been
              put together, I hope that the researchers will go out to the
              education and library boards to meet the people and explain how
              they came to their findings. The Department will shortly decide
              how to move the subsequent debate forward. We shall then have to
              bear in mind all the debate’s implications for the Department of
              Education, for the Executive and for society as a whole. At this
              stage, when we do not know what our decision will be, based on
              research and consultation, it is difficult to answer the Member’s
              question, since it presumes we shall initiate wholesale change.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not know what the outcome will be. All I
              know is that it is a serious matter. It must be handled extremely
              sensitively, and the Department is doing just that. Some people
              may have criticisms about the slowness of the process, but some of
              the delay has come about because we decided at a late stage to
              conduct a comparative examination of other systems elsewhere in
              the world. It is impossible at this stage to talk about the report’s
              financial implications until such time as we have the debate, go
              through the consultation period and I, as Minister of Education,
              in consultation with everyone else, decide how we move forward.
              When we reach that stage, and a decision has been taken, we shall
              look at the financial implications.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am somewhat puzzled by the Member’s
              question. It is not only in order; it is a requirement. It is in
              Standing Orders that there shall be questions for an hour and a
              half — from 2.30 pm to 4.00&nbsp;pm. The alternative is that a
              Minister will appear for questions once every three months and
              have an hour and a half. The decision of the Business Committee
              was that three ministerial Departments would be here for questions
              each Monday from 2.30 pm to 4.00 pm. Ninety minutes divided by
              three gives 30&nbsp;minutes, and that is the amount of time
              available. It is entirely in order for that decision to be taken.
              It would also be in order for the alternative decision to be taken
              that one hour 30 minutes be available for Ministerial questions
              but only once every three months or so. The immediate answer to
              the question is that it is in order.</p>

              range of services in hospitals throughout its area, including the
              Downe, and I am very aware of how important hospital services are
              to local communities. As I have said, I want to ensure that

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rural interest groups have been consulted
              throughout the drawing up of the proposals. They are represented
              on the interim community support framework monitoring committee
              and on a working group which has been established and will be

              the monitoring committee over the next key stage of the
              development of the operational programmes. I also make the point
              that there are matters and measures involved in Peace&nbsp;II
              which will involve other Ministers. I know for example that the
              Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development expects that a rural
              intermediary funding body will continue to form part of the
              delivery mechanism for the distribution of Peace&nbsp;II funds,
              and obviously that will work closely with the full range of rural
              and agricultural interests.</p>

              discussions, if any, he has had with the European Investment Bank
              to secure loan funding for Northern Ireland’s rural economy?</p>

              Community Network and the Northern Ireland Rural Development
              Council programmes to be extremely beneficial. Can the Minister
              comment more fully on speculation that under the current proposals
              to distribute Peace&nbsp;II funds neither the Rural Community
              Network nor the Northern Ireland Rural Development Council will be
              allocated any funding? There is also a suggestion that there is no

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Not unlike the Deputy First Minister this
              morning, I would point out that we have reached the community
              support framework stage of Peace&nbsp;II, which sets out the broad
              strategy and rationale on the funds. The next key stage examines
              the development of the operational programmes. Rural interests are
              fully represented on the interim monitoring committee for the
              community support framework and will also be represented on the
              monitoring committee that would be established for Peace&nbsp;II.
              In relation to delivery mechanisms, we are trying to make sure
              that form follows function. I can certainly reassure the Member,
              and indeed any others who are concerned, that the Minister of
              Agriculture and Rural Development is clearly determined and fully
              expects that a specific rural intermediary funding body will
              continue to form part of the delivery mechanism for the
              administration of Peace&nbsp;II funds, a point which people were
              particularly concerned about. The Executive is making it clear
              that in relation to any measures that will fall to any of the
              Departments to administer, those Departments are going to have to
              show that they attach a premium to social inclusion, to
              cross-border activity and to applying measures to and through
              local delivery mechanisms also. That is something that will be
              monitored by the Executive as well as by all the other monitoring
              arrangements that exist.</p>

              to discuss the budgets for his Department, and that included the
              budget for the Housing Executive. Representations in relation to
              budgetary matters take many forms, and as well as expressing his
              concerns about the housing budget at our meeting, the Minister has
              used other means as well.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Turning to Mr&nbsp;Cobain’s question, I
              stress that the Housing Executive will be able to retain almost
              £60&nbsp;million of house sale receipts in the current year to
              offset its costs. As with other receipts, any extra will be at the
              disposal of the Executive Committee and this Assembly to be used
              to address emerging pressures which could, of course, include
              housing. This general principle on receipts enables planning for

              predecessor in terms of the budget allocation to the Housing
              Executive has resulted in the postponement and sometime
              abandonment of much needed rural redevelopment and rehabilitation
              programmes? Will he take this matter up with his ministerial
              Colleague for Social Development? There seems to be some confusion
              in that a letter that I have states that work on the refurbishment

              address this issue either unilaterally or in conjunction with
              others? Rural community rehabilitation and redevelopment has
              lagged behind urban renewal and rehabilitation, and it needs that
              re-injection of finances to enable the current planned programmes
              to be implemented.</p>

              If there are problems in ensuring that funding in respect of
              various programmes is going to areas for which it was intended,
              that should be taken up through the relevant agencies and,
              obviously, by the relevant departmental Minister. DFP’s
              responsibility lies in the overall allocation to the various
              programmes of the Departments. The administration of those
              allocations then falls to those Departments and Ministers, subject
              to delegated authority from the Department of Finance and
              Personnel and subject to approval and various other standard
              requirements. A lot of cases have been made and reflected here in
              the course of recent debates on the supply resolution and some of
              the questions on the Estimates. The many and diverse pressures on
              the various aspects of the housing programme have certainly been

              have already made it clear that this year the Housing Executive
              will have gross resources of £528&nbsp;million. Let us remember

              work in the new-build area of the Housing Associations, and that

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Returning to the point that I made previously
              about the treatment of receipts, there is a suggestion, which has
              been a recurring theme in this House, that the Housing Executive
              should be allowed to retain all receipts generated by house sales.
              As with receipts in any Department or programme, any extra revenue
              has to be placed at the disposal of the Executive Committee and
              the Assembly. It is clear that not all programmes generate
              receipts and, therefore, not all programmes or services can
              benefit from windfall receipts. There are some extra receipts in
              housing this year, and where these extra receipts emerge, they are
              pooled for reallocation across various programmes in which there
              are pressures. Many people have identified that one of the
              programmes with pressures, and in which they want to see
              additional resources, is housing. Ministerial Colleagues and I
              will, at a future point, try to bear that in mind when such moneys
              are available for reallocation.</p>

              report that said that up to £26&nbsp;million per annum could be
              lost through inadequate co-ordination and inaccurate information

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Member. First, I am not aware of
              the basis for the figure of £26 million quoted. I certainly do
              not believe, whatever figure people may have been referring to
              specifically in relation to the question of loss of rate revenue,
              that it was £26 million. None of the information available to me
              concerning the Rate Collection Agency’s performance, in recovery
              terms, suggests that there is any such haemorrhage or deficit in
              the recovery of the rates. I assume that someone has
              misinterpreted other references made at that particular meeting,
              which was discussing a project being brought forward under the
              Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister. The

              information services delivered by Government to citizens and
              businesses of Northern Ireland. As to where the figure of
              £26&nbsp;million came from, certainly in terms of the Rate
              Collection Agency’s performance and responsibility I do not know
              the basis for that figure.</p>

              is probably a request that will not go away. Does the Minister
              agree that our rural towns and villages would benefit from
              decentralisation? If he does agree, would he advise this Assembly
              of what measures he may introduce to relocate agencies and
              services under his control?</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The supplementary question is turning a further
              corner. I appreciate Mr&nbsp;Bradley’s disappointment at my
              answer in relation to the Newry office of the Rate Collection
              Agency. However, in terms not unrelated to my answer to Mr Carrick,
              the fact is that the agency’s performance in rate recovery has
              continued to improve, even with the closure of some of the local
              offices. More and more people are using direct debit and local
              post office services for the payment of rates.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to the relocation of other agencies

              I should make it clear, as Minister with overall responsibility
              for the Rate Collection Agency, that the closure of the offices
              that took place over recent years has not actually been at the
              expense of the overall performance of the agency. It certainly has
              not even been at the expense of the performance of the agency in
              respect of those localities. The payment rate and recovery rate
              has remained high and has even improved. Let us remember that
              people are now availing of different payment systems than were
              previously available.</p>

              foul of the rule of anticipation. If a Member was to put down such

              the Business Office, because it would be in anticipation of a
              question that is already down. I have to make a ruling that
              Members are not at liberty to ask a supplementary question if it

              in the southern region, not the general question of
              decentralisation. Is the Minister aware that the tendency in the
              southern region has been to centralise services in the Craigavon
              area, which is less accessible than Belfast for people from Newry,
              South Armagh and South Down? I hope this is something that will be

              how far they extend, but I remind them that, when there is a
              substantive question, they should bring their supplementary in
              under that. It should be a question, not an observation, however

              the Member makes. Clearly, based on the fact that there has been
              economic growth and greater buoyancy in the economy here, one
              might assume this would also translate into higher tax yields.

              the last words of his announcement. It is regrettable that since
              we discussed this during our previous period of devolution, the
              Department does not seem to have done any work. The Minister has
              had to ask his civil servants once again to proceed with it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">May I remind him of the recent report about the
              dangers of congestion on the eastern side of this island, with the
              potential to have half the population living in the Belfast/Dublin
              corridor. In the Republic there seems to be a significant
              decentralisation of Government Departments. Will he indicate when
              he may produce a comprehensive report for Northern Ireland,
              preferably in line with his remarks about anticipation earlier,
              and without giving other Members an opportunity to detail the
              merits of their constituencies?</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Member for not encouraging people
              to offer sites and premises. That is an issue we are bringing
              forward in the Department. I accept Mr&nbsp;Ford’s interest in
              this particular matter, but it would be wrong to mischaracterise
              the Department as being reluctant in this regard. The Department
              of Finance and Personnel, while not a high profile Department, is
              very busy. We have been bringing forward a range of measures to
              both the House, and the Executive Committee. The policy on
              accommodation and relocation is one example. It is a policy
              currently being developed, and when the paper is ready, I will
              consult with ministerial colleagues and the Finance and Personnel
              Committee. We will try to do that as soon as possible.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In case anyone misinterprets my remarks about
              the 20 jobs that will be relocated to Derry, I would point out
              that these jobs will be incorporated into the Civil Service
              Pensions Branch, which is already in Waterside House in the city.</p>

              will the Minister agree that the best way of ensuring job creation
              outside the Belfast area, and, indeed, outside the eastern
              corridor, is by a series of measures under the Programme of
              Government to stimulate the overall rate of economic growth and
              not by fiddling about with the relocation of Government
              Departments almost certainly with no saving of money?</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The broader economic strategy is obviously one
              that I, as a Minister, have shared responsibility for with all my
              ministerial colleagues. Civil service accommodation and location
              is a matter for which I am specifically accountable as a Minister.
              It is entirely legitimate for Members to raise questions in that
              regard. A redistribution of civil service jobs can ease a variety
              of problems. It can contribute to easing the congestion that has
              already been identified, and clearly that is something that has
              been pursued with some success in other jurisdictions, often to
              great applause from the people who have more room to breathe when
              civil servants move elsewhere.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Decentralisation could contribute to the
              quality of life and in a variety of localities across Northern
              Ireland. It is consistent, for instance, with such policy papers
              as ‘Shaping our Future’ et cetera. Obviously, we want to take
              account of targeting social need and equality considerations
              there, but clearly we cannot pursue such a policy without a proper
              and responsible regard to cost. We must be realistic about that.</p>

              throughout Northern Ireland — and not just to the places where
              those jobs would be located. We are in an age where the case that
              was made in the past for centralising such functions no longer
              exists. The Member is right to identify a variety of potential

              Ministerial Council in Dublin on Friday 16&nbsp;June&nbsp;2000.
              Mr&nbsp;Foster and I attended. The Irish Government were
              represented by Mr&nbsp;Charlie&nbsp;McCreevy&nbsp;TD, Minister for
              Finance, who chaired the meeting. This report has been approved by
              Mr&nbsp;Foster and is also made on his behalf.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The council underlined the important
              contribution to peace, reconciliation, regional development and
              cross-border co-operation made by European Union programmes and
              looked forward to the significant new role of the special EU
              programmes body (SEUPB) in the negotiation, management, monitoring
              and delivery of the programmes. The council expressed the firm
              desire that the new political context and the role of the SEUPB
              should ensure a higher level of expenditure on co-operative
              actions co-funded by the European Union, especially Peace II. The
              council agreed that the establishment of the SEUPB served as a
              tangible, further reflection of the support and solidarity that
              has been shown by the European Union in seeking to advance
              reconciliation and peace and of its commitment to the new
              dispensation heralded by the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The council received a verbal progress report
              from Mr&nbsp;Philip&nbsp;Angus, interim chief executive of the
              SEUPB, on the work of the body. The body currently has 19 staff
              drawn from central government Departments, North and South. It has
              its headquarters in Belfast, an office in Monaghan, and a further
              office will be opened in Omagh.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The council endorsed proposals for taking
              forward the responsibilities of the body, which will be
              implemented under the direction of the interim chief executive.
              The council also endorsed the initial staffing structure for the
              body and approved the formal procedure for the appointment of a
              permanent chief executive to the body.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The council noted a position paper on the Peace
              II programme and agreed that officials of the SEUPB would
              contribute, in accordance with its mandate, as appropriate, to the
              forthcoming negotiations on Peace&nbsp;II with the European
              Commission. The council noted a common text on North/South
              co-operation, which will be included in the respective community
              support frameworks for Northern Ireland and Ireland. The council
              approved a guidance framework for the SEUPB, which had been
              prepared by the Department of Finance and Personnel and the
              Department of Finance. It also noted that further guidance on the
              role and functions of SEUPB and the Finance Departments was being
              prepared by the Finance Departments in consultation with the body.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The council agreed it would meet on a quarterly
              basis in this sectoral format and that the next meeting would take
              place in October in Northern Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The council agreed the text of a joint
              communiqué which was issued following the meeting. A copy of the
              communiqué has been placed in the Assembly Library.</p>

              The broad framework we have been taking forward at this stage has
              concentrated on the community support framework, which is a
              broad-band strategy and rational. We believe this takes forward

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr ONeill rightly identifies the importance of
              transparency and due scrutiny with these funds, as with any funds
              managed in the public interest. Regarding monitoring, we already
              have the Interim Community Support Framework Monitoring Committee,
              and when we have the community support framework agreed, that will
              no longer be in shadow format. There will also be monitoring
              committees for the operational programmes under the peace
              programme and the transition programme. Those monitoring
              committees will involve a range of interests, including the social
              partners, local government, relative departments, etcetera.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The interim monitoring committee for the
              community support framework includes representatives of all
              parties in the Assembly. Mr ONeill may have touched on a useful
              idea when he said that the Assembly might want to consider setting
              up a monitoring Committee of its own, not least in relation to
              Peace II. This would enable the Assembly to underline the
              importance of the additionality requirements of the peace
              programme, as distinct from the other European moneys. It is a
              proposal that the Department of Finance and Personnel would not be
              averse to. We have touched on it in some exchanges with the
              Finance and Personnel Committee and I further discussed the
              possibilities with the chairman of that Committee. Clearly, it
              would be very important that anything set up by the Assembly did
              not in any way conflict with the role and responsibility of the
              Statutory Committee.</p>

              regard to INTERREG III, we are required to submit forward
              programme proposals to Brussels by November 2000. Funding under
              that programme will not be available until next year. SEUPB has
              issued a consultation paper to some 800 organisations and
              individuals, and a consultation conference was held in Monaghan
              last week. Structures will be put in place to continue the

              characteristics, which Mr Neeson suggests should be evident in
              INTERREG III, would be welcome as an appropriate graduation in the
              nature and quality of the co-operation that the INTERREG programme
              should be developing and engendering. We are aware of particular

              pipeline, I would make the point that the transition programme, as
              it is currently drafted, would give a basis for using such EU
              funds to support energy projects both in the gas and electricity
              fields. For this to happen, the Executive Committee would have to
              decide that public expenditure would cover these projects. In
              relation to the natural gas project as indicated by the Minister
              of Enterprise, Trade and Investment, we are awaiting the outcome

              the identity of some of the money referred to in this programme.
              There is a tendency, particularly with EU money, for a lot of
              double counting to go on. We must be careful that we are
              identifying different pools of money. Equally, we need to be clear
              when we are talking about the same pool of money. Where EU money
              is concerned, the technique is rather like writing a history essay
              when you do not have much information: say what you are going to
              say, then say it, then say what you have said.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If I may, I will link the Minister’s
              statement to the one made this morning by the Deputy First
              Minister, which dealt with the overarching programme for EU money.
              If I remember correctly, he said that the Peace II money would be
              worth an average of £75&nbsp;million per annum for the next six
              years. I note that the cross-border sub-programme will have a
              minimum budget of 75&nbsp;million euro, which I think is slightly
              less than £50&nbsp;million at current exchange rates. Will the
              Minister confirm whether that money is part of the peace money
              mentioned this morning, or whether it is a further amount?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If it is part of the same money, does that mean
              that instead of being spent exclusively in Northern Ireland, which
              is the impression one would have gained this morning, in fact it
              may be the case that some of the money will be spent on the other
              side of the border? It seems to me that our money should be spent
              on our side of the border and their money should be spent on their

              that point.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I could not help noticing that the meeting was
              chaired by Mr McCreevy. I believe his nickname is &quot;champagne
              Charlie&quot;. I wondered if he brought some champagne with him,
              before they changed around the exchange rates and issued the
              communiqué. Will the Minister also confirm that the chairmanship
              goes with the host, that is, that it will rotate according to the
              country in which the meeting is being held?</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the last point, chairing is the
              responsibility of the host Administration. That was why Mr
              McCreevy chaired the meeting on 16 June.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To clarify the question of the peace money and
              the cross-border priority, I refer to a point I made earlier. As
              well as having the distinct cross-border priority, which is there
              to ensure that at least that amount of money is made available for
              cross-border co-operation, and indeed wider east-west
              co-operation, we also set out to ensure that all Departments, when
              considering those aspects of the peace programme that fall to
              them, put a due premium on the need to ensure social inclusion and
              to use and support local delivery mechanisms and on cross-border
              co-operation itself. That is a cross-cutting theme as well as a
              single identifiable priority. In a sense, it is both. To use the
              jargon, it involves both a vertical and a horizontal approach. The
              cross-border money that I am talking about is clearly within the
              peace programme. All of the Northern Ireland moneys in the peace
              programme will be spent in Northern Ireland.</p>

              relation to the role of the SEUP what is the timetable for putting
              together operational programmes, and how does the Minister
              envisage the cross-border dimension working in reality on the
              ground? I noted his earlier reference to the role of cross-border
              local authorities. Many such authorities are interested in helping
              to facilitate the outworkings of this new body.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister and the Deputy First
              Minister visited Brussels last week and, from the point of view of
              our Administration, the development of the community support
              framework is now complete. The Commission will publish the
              framework next month. The next phase will be the development of
              the operational programmes, and these have to be in place by
              October. SEUPB — the body with the role of managing and
              monitoring Peace II — clearly has a key role in that regard. We
              will be developing the operational programme framework in
              conjunction with the interim monitoring committee. There will also
              be a monitoring committee for each of the operational programmes
              — the peace programme and the transition programme.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Once the operational programmes are in place we
              have to produce programme complements which will bring forward the
              measures in specific and detailed terms. The deadline for this is
              no later than three months after the operational programmes have
              been agreed. We do not want to be in a situation where we run out
              of time at the end, so we have added on time at the beginning. We
              have been working on the programme complements in parallel with
              the work on the operational programmes. We want as much input as
              possible from all relevant interests and from all localities, be
              they at the border or elsewhere. We want to ensure that everybody,
              including local government, has sufficient input into the process.
              To implement all the various suggestions and ambitions would cost
              a lot more than the total sum available. Therefore we need to use
              the consultation exercises, not only to weed out particular ideas
              or projects, but also to see how a more positive synergy and
              complementarity can be developed between the many different ideas
              and proposals.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There may appear to be a bit of telepathy
              between Mr Byrne and myself — I am raising the same issue. In
              point nine of the joint communiqué the council noted that the
              sub-programme would provide opportunities for the funding of
              cross-border co-operative action across the full range of economic
              areas. Point four states that the new programmes have the capacity
              to have a real impact on the lives of people in Northern Ireland
              and the border area. What role does the Minister see for the three
              cross-border bodies — the north-west body, the Irish Central
              Border Area Network and the eastern border counties body? I am a
              member of the north-west regional cross-border committee, and I am
              sure the Minister will agree that these bodies, via their
              secretariats, have built up a tremendous expertise. A vast local
              knowledge exists within each body which stems from the local
              council input. I want further clarification that these bodies will
              be respected in their input and that when the time comes they will
              be considered as very good vehicles for the implementation of the
              programme.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the development of these programmes we want
              to apply positive lessons from other EU programmes such as Peace
              I. In response to a similar question from Éamonn ONeill a couple
              of weeks ago, I made it clear that in INTERREG III we would be
              looking at how local delivery mechanisms, particularly through
              representative partnership networks, could be used as a means of
              making sure that we had the best impact as far as that programme
              was concerned.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The three cross-border networks represent 18
              councils along the entire border corridor with some 100 elected
              representatives serving on the various cross-border networks.
              Obviously there is significant political support in the border
              regions, both North and South. I am aware that there is widespread
              support for their integrated area plans, and for the combined
              border corridor strategy, which consultants have been drafting on
              their behalf. We want to make sure that those networks can have as
              full an input as possible to the developing work on INTERREG III
              and, indeed, on some of the wider cross-border issues. As Mr
              Hussey rightly identified, there is a common chapter under the
              community support framework that will underline the importance of
              optimising the rate and nature of cross-border co-operation across
              the full range of social, economic and environmental programmes.
              Any contribution that representative networks, such as the three
              cross-border ones, can make would be very welcome.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We will fully respect, and ask for, that input.
              That of itself cannot constitute a promise that what the networks
              bid for themselves, as to what they would directly administer,
              will automatically be granted. The Member will be aware that we
              have to proceed on an open basis, and I am sure that the three
              networks will be satisfied with the quality of that openness.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have three questions for the Minister of
              Finance and Personnel. First, I was asked this morning about
              intermediary funding bodies. Will the Minister clarify what use
              will be made of the intermediary funding bodies in the new round
              of Peace II? Secondly, can he give a commitment that
              non-Government parties will be included in the monitoring process?
              Finally, what specific budget has he made available in Peace II
              for victims?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, intermediary funding bodies are clearly
              going to be involved in the delivery of Peace II. However, I
              cannot speculate about, or anticipate, the precise bodies and
              areas of involvement. Those matters will be decided in conjunction
              with the Peace II monitoring committee. I appreciate that there
              has been concern in some quarters that local delivery mechanisms
              and partnership boards may somehow be relegated in relation to
              Peace II. That is not the case.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I understand that people were also concerned
              that intermediary funding bodies were going to be squeezed; that
              is not the case either. We are trying to learn and apply all the
              positive lessons of Peace II and develop them in ways that will be
              effective, so as to sustain these measures, not just for the life
              of the Peace II programme, but beyond that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We want these benefits to continue into the
              future. Our European Colleagues, who gave this money, do not just
              want to see us spend it over a five year period — they want us
              to invest it and secure returns on it in positive peace-building
              terms, involving regeneration and reconciliation over a longer
              period.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I indicated that decisions about the precise
              bodies that would be used, and the areas of their responsibility,
              would be something that would be developed and worked on with the
              monitoring committee. Currently the Interim community support
              framework monitoring committee has places for all parties in the
              Assembly. Unfortunately, it is a pretty unwieldy body, and I am
              not sure that the added presence of the various political parties,
              and the rotating attendance that that tends to give rise to,
              necessarily helps the focus of the Committee as far as some of its
              other members are concerned.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I refer the Member to the point that Éamonn&nbsp;ONeill
              made when earlier he suggested that the Assembly should have a
              separate monitoring committee of its own, particularly in relation
              to Peace II. That would be one of the ways in which the Assembly
              could underline the importance and distinctiveness of the
              additionality principle, and it is certainly something that I
              would not be averse to. If it happened, it might ease the
              overcrowding problem that can occur on the wider interim
              monitoring committee.</p>

              </font></b><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I must confess that the brass neck of those who
              have instigated today’s debate, in reference to the House of
              Commons Public Accounts Committee Report on the Industrial
              Development Board, never ceases to amaze me.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Like many others, I have expressed concern over
              the years at the lack of real long-term employment brought into
              Northern Ireland by all the job creation agencies, the chief one
              of course being the Industrial Development Board (IDB). However, I
              also understand the difficulties that the IDB and other agencies
              have had over the years in attempting to increase employment and
              remove the scourge of unemployment, especially in areas west of
              the Bann. Those difficulties were made worse by 30&nbsp;years of
              terrorism when IRA/Sinn Féin carried out a bloody campaign of
              terror against workers, against industrialists and against places
              of employment.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many of our towns and villages have been blown
              apart. Tens of millions of pounds were wasted, and thousands of
              jobs were lost from the Northern Ireland economy. Magherafelt town
              centre, for example, was blown asunder; the banks were destroyed;
              shops were destroyed; the blood of an innocent bystander,
              Mr&nbsp;Johnston, flowed along the street — shed by the
              sectarian thugs of the IRA. There was also a young man in that
              town — a street cleaner — who was seen as a great threat to
              the community. He was blown up as he sought to do his work in our
              local town and community. He is still alive, but his legs were
              completely blown off. He has been left to wheel himself around in
              a wheelchair for the rest of his days, when he wanted nothing more
              than to be employed and to work to provide for the needs of his
              wife and children.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Who will forget the vanload of workmen coming
              down the Omagh/Cookstown road — men returning from a hard day’s
              work, doing an honest day’s work for a simple pay! Yet they were
              also thought to be a great danger to society because they happened
              to work in a security base — builders, bricklayers and the likes
              — returning from work one evening, coming to a place called
              Teebane. There is a memorial to those men along the side of the
              road and attempts have been made to disfigure that — the Provos
              even think the memorial to be obscene, just as they saw the
              workmen as obscene. They saw them as a threat because, unlike the
              Provos, they did not lie about all day and then go and blow the
              place to smithereens at night. They simply worked all day and
              rested at night before they went to do another hard day’s work.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is rather obnoxious to find that party
              trying to use us to sanitise them — house-train, I think is the
              phrase — and make them look democratic. Somehow the party thinks
              that we are going to overlook the atrocities and vote in support
              of a hypocritical motion which would sicken any true democrat. I
              think of many of those people because many of them were my
              constituents.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Millions of pounds have been wasted west of the
              Bann, and thousands of jobs have been blown to smithereens, and
              now we hear pious platitudes and appeals for jobs from Members for
              the west of the Bann. Those are empty words, and I suggest that it
              will do no credit to the House to give any credibility to those
              who have no credit, decency, integrity or sense of democracy
              whatsoever.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is against that backcloth of sickening,
              dastardly, atrocious and sectarian murders and bombings that the
              IDB has had to go across the world and proclaim the message of job
              creation in Northern&nbsp;Ireland. Its task was made a very
              difficult one because of those years of murder and mayhem.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is true that the report of the Public
              Accounts Committee at Westminster highlights matters that have
              caused me concern for quite some time. The people of the
              Magherafelt and Cookstown areas have felt that the number of
              projects and real substantive jobs that they enjoyed was
              inadequate in comparison with the number that went to other areas.
              I know that many highlight the differences between east and west
              and that many say that that ought to be investigated. But I am not
              talking about that. I am speaking about the differences between
              jobs that are all west of the Bann. When I think of the jobs that
              are created west of the Bann and of the finance that is directed
              there, I cannot help but wonder at the massive difference in the
              amounts of money spent in one part of west of the Bann to the
              detriment of the rest of west of the Bann.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It amazes me that every time people talk about
              west of the Bann, they seem really only to be talking about a
              particular part of the city of Londonderry, and that is where all
              the money seems to be going. The Waterside area of that city and,
              of course, the rest of the west of the Province seem to be left
              out of any capital expenditure. Very few have been given the
              initiatives and the number of jobs that have gone into a
              particular part of the city of Londonderry, and that is wrong.
              When we talk about west of the Bann we are talking about more than
              the Bogside — other people happen to exist as well.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There ought to be an investigation into why
              millions have gone into this one part. Why has so little gone into
              the remainder by comparison, especially when one realises the
              difference in the numbers of persons and the large geographical
              area in question. That is why many people in the Cookstown and
              Magherafelt areas feel deeply disgruntled and frustrated. It seems
              that this money, when it goes west of the Bann, goes in one
              direction. It is trundling over the Glenshane Pass and is not
              stopping in the areas about which I have spoken. It is heading
              straight to one particular area. In spite of all the money being
              pumped in to that area we are being told it has not affected the
              unemployment levels. Where is the money going?</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It seems to me that a large amount of money has
              been trundled into one area, and after the money has been received
              and the initial period is over, and they do not have to pay it
              back, that it is a case of ‘Goodnight Irene’. They are ready
              for the next amount of money — but the jobs do not stay. There
              ought to be an investigation, and I would like to see the relevant
              Committee looking in detail at exactly how many of these companies
              have stayed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another investigation ought to be carried out.
              I remember the time when the Belfast Agreement was being sold. At
              that time I found getting to Belfast more difficult than ever
              before. I will tell you why. We never knew what road we would have
              to divert to, as there were so many lorries of money coming in
              through the airports and seaports. Announcements of these moneys
              and initiatives were made in order to buy off the people with the
              golden cord of the Belfast Agreement. It was the usual bluff and
              guff we have heard from the British Government since the process
              began. It is the re-circulation of the same money, but it rarely
              gets here. They re-circulate it by making an announcement that the
              money is coming in. However, they announce it again in a month’s
              time, and then again in another month’s time. I hope that some
              day the money will actually come.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is sickening, because the people of Northern
              Ireland were sold a false story in the Belfast Agreement that if
              the people would buy into the system we would suddenly come into
              the Garden of Eden or the land of Canaan flowing with milk and
              honey.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">According to the report it is clear that a
              substantial number of jobs promised were not in fact created.
              Therefore, I believe that we ought to see a more in-depth study of
              what has gone on in industrial development. I applaud the IDB for
              their successes — and make no mistake they have had successes
              under difficult circumstances — and I rejoice with those who
              have gained. Why should I not do so? They have been successful.
              However, I also believe that there needs to be a spreading of the
              cake throughout the area west of the Bann, as well as considering
              the east and west differential.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I trust that, after the debate has died down,
              in-depth studies will examine the channelling of finances in this
              Province because I believe that there are corrupt practices going
              on. Many people who funnel the money do not produce the goods.
              That does no good to those genuine business people who come in and
              provide excellent employment for the good people of Ulster.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.
              The report contained a very pertinent question, a LeasCheann
              Comhairle, and I think Mr&nbsp;Gardiner asked it. He asked what
              exactly a job promoted looked like? He asked the IDB that
              question, and we might ask the same question because we see so few
              of these promoted jobs.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This House cannot seriously try to defend the
              IDB’s record on foot of this report by referring to a conflict
              of the past 30&nbsp;years. Even if some did try, perhaps we should
              remind them that ceasefires have been in place for the past
              five&nbsp;years and that the IDB must surely go into the record
              books for its efforts during those past five&nbsp;years. In north
              and west Belfast they created two jobs in that space of time —
              two jobs in that unemployment black spot.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Despite reports from various economic forums,
              and using the various indices, the area I have mentioned remains
              one of the most impoverished areas in Europe. The IDB failed
              miserably in its responsibility to address that situation, and it
              should hang its head in shame over the announcement that it could
              create only two jobs. We are debating this motion because the
              Public Accounts Committee was very aware of the failures of the
              IDB to discharge its responsibilities.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the Foyle constituency, for example, the IDB
              has reduced its support to client businesses by 14% in the past
              year. This comes at a time when Derry City Council clearly
              indicated in its economic strategy report that the constituency
              needs to create 12,000 jobs simply to bring it up to the Six
              County average. The Public Accounts Committee — and I assert
              this here today — is doing what it is appointed to do, namely
              make public bodies like the IDB accountable for their use of
              public money. The IDB has never truly been held to account for its
              stewardship of job promotion. The closure of its offices in Derry,
              the selling of its land bank and its fatalistic attitude towards
              the near extinction of the textile and other traditional
              industries, with some exceptions of course, were not matters that
              we, the elected representatives, were informed of or consulted
              about. Nor did these decisions, fundamental to job promotion west
              of the Bann, merit an explanation. I should indeed like to be able
              to say the IDB did a fine job, but I cannot see the evidence.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This morning I heard a Member use the words
              &quot;creative accountancy&quot; to describe a combination of
              efficiency and class distinction. We could be charitable and say
              that the IDB perhaps mismanaged its brief. I should be more
              inclined to say that its brief was much influenced by its total
              lack of interest in explaining why it wasted public money on firms
              and companies which, to put it mildly, ripped us all off. They
              certainly ripped the IDB off.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to draw Members’ attention to the fact
              that we may be about to be ripped off again since, as some Members
              mentioned this morning, some of these jobs promised by the IDB’s
              call-centre clients are now being moved to England before they
              have even been established. Two hundred and fifty jobs will be
              lost, though we in the Foyle constituency were promised
              650&nbsp;call-centre jobs last year. We are told that they are in
              the pipeline, that there are some difficulties, but we have not
              seen them yet.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to support this motion. I hope that
              people read the Public Accounts Committee’s report. It is
              valuable teaching for us all, and I hope that the transparency and
              accountability it advocates will become the hallmarks of Members
              of this Assembly. Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Beggs:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am an Assembly Member for East Antrim, a
              constituency that takes in the borough of Carrickfergus, which has
              the fifth-highest unemployment rate of any council district in
              Northern Ireland, something which many people from the west of the
              Province appear to forget. As a matter of interest, it is also at
              present excluded from much of the IDB’s financial support.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am also a member of the Northern Ireland
              Public Accounts Committee, so to a certain extent I have an
              interest both in that side of things and in the wise investment of
              IDB funds in Northern Ireland. I welcome the monitoring of the IDB
              by the Northern Ireland Audit Office, which, for everyone’s
              information, actually took place in October 1998. Its initial
              report has been picked up by the Public Accounts Committee and
              highlighted at Westminster.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I too support much of the report’s valid
              criticism of the IDB, in particular that which relates to the lack
              of value for money as a result of many of its decisions. However,
              I have several concerns about the motion before us today. As some
              Members have already said, there is an issue of protocol, since
              the matter has been investigated by the Public Accounts Committee
              of the House of Commons, whose procedures are currently ongoing.
              The Department has yet to make a response.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, we must take note of the fact that
              the report is only five-weeks old. What would be the point in the
              Northern Ireland Public Accounts Committee’s producing a
              subsequent report on the issue? In my opinion, we must await a
              response from the Department. Thereafter, time will be required to
              establish whether the recommendations will be implemented. It is
              pointless for the Northern Ireland Public Accounts Committee to
              have an immediate investigation.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.00 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The function of the Northern Ireland Public
              Accounts Committee is to examine areas of concern and to bring
              accounting officers and other civil servants to account before the
              Committee and the Northern Ireland public. Its duty is also to
              highlight issues of impropriety and thus bring improvements to the
              spending of public money. The House of Commons Public Accounts
              Committee is in the process of doing this, and the Northern
              Ireland Audit Office will automatically follow up many of the
              recommendations in the original report as a matter of course.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are several existing means by which the
              Assembly can continue to take an interest. Individual Members can
              put down questions for written or oral answer. The Committee for
              Enterprise, Trade and Investment, to which the IDB is accountable,
              can deal with the issues in detail. If that fails, and the
              Northern Ireland Audit Office advises us that improvements have
              not been made, it can be brought before the Northern Ireland
              Public Accounts Committee. It would be inappropriate, to assume
              now that that is what will happen.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am concerned at the directive element in the
              motion. I ask Members to note that of the 18 reports that the
              House of Commons PAC has published this year, this is the first
              which applies specifically to Northern Ireland. What about 17
              reports, published by the Northern Ireland Audit Office, which
              require investigation by the Northern Ireland PAC? We have a
              responsibility to investigate those reports in detail, and to
              bring the accounting officers responsible to account. Road safety,
              suspected fraud in the Department of Agriculture and Rural
              Development and river pollution are issues, which have not been
              addressed in the past. It is improper at this time to give a
              directive on one particular issue. Time is required to see whether
              the advice will be taken and if there is any need for a subsequent
              report. It would not be putting the Northern&nbsp;Ireland PAC to
              best use by having it reinvestigate these issues now.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is a surprise to see this motion coming from
              Sinn&nbsp;Féin. As other Assembly Members have said, the fact
              that terrorism has been going on in Northern&nbsp;Ireland makes
              this motion’s coming from it hypocritical. I would appreciate
              the same amount of pressure and the same directive style coming
              from Sinn&nbsp;Féin/IRA to ensure that the so-called punishment
              attacks, mutilations and recent terrorist actions — the bomb in
              Ballymurphy, for instance — become things of the past. Whether
              Sinn Féin Members like it or not, such terrorist action make
              investment in West Belfast more difficult for the IDB to secure,
              and this is an important matter they should address in their
              constituencies.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have sympathy with much of the content of the
              report. However, because I consider it inappropriate to
              investigate the issue again and to give a directive at this time,
              I will not be supporting the motion.</p>

              ability or success of the IDB? I am not sure. It is a question
              that he needs to answer since he asked one of a similar kind about

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do accept that IDB has faced difficulties
              over a long number of years. I am certainly not here today to put
              a lot of those difficulties at the door of the Minister, Reg Empey,
              because he is only recently in post.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the motion. I do not accept, or even
              understand, the arguments that people are putting forward that
              because the Public Accounts Committee in the British Parliament is
              dealing with this we should not. If that is the case, we will not
              be dealing with a lot of issues here. Just because they have
              already been dealt with in London or are in the process of being
              dealt with there, should we pack up and go home? The motion is
              self-explanatory. It merely says that there is an issue which has
              been aired in the Public Accounts Committee’s report, and Dr O’Hagan
              is asking the Assembly to continue taking an active interest in
              it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to speak essentially for my
              constituency. The figures in the report show that in West Belfast
              there has been a net reduction in jobs in spite of all the money
              that has been spent by agencies, including the IDB. To try to
              evaluate this in the longer term, would it not be better if the
              IDB were to identify a budget for the various constituencies,
              building into that an identifiable element of targeting social
              need, which nobody ever seems to be able to quantify? I would like
              to see a budget which is identified, which is TSN proofed, which
              is related to the various industries and to deprivation, need and
              lack of employment opportunities, constituency by constituency. If
              possible, I would further like that money to be used by the IDB to
              work with local communities, district councils and local
              partnerships, et cetera, to try to develop and marry the various
              strategies to ensure that at least a portion of the IDB budget
              which has been allocated for constituencies is ring-fenced. A
              strategy should be developed in conjunction with the local
              communities, the success of which can eventually be evaluated. If
              people know the budget that is available to them, and are
              realistic with that budget, local strategies, working with the IDB
              and other Government Departments can give us a way forward.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to the jibe, I did not support it.
              I do not support anything that comes from Sinn Féin/IRA. It is
              not up to me to decide what is kept off the Order Paper as far as
              the business of this Assembly is concerned. The Member knows that
              very well; he was there when the whole matter was discussed. If he
              wants to make a few silly, stupid jibes, that is a matter entirely
              for him.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For 30&nbsp;years Northern&nbsp;Ireland has
              been subjected to a vicious and ruthless terror campaign, much of
              which has been waged against economic targets. While I feel that
              the IDB should be subjected to a root-and-branch overhaul, I would
              be foolhardy and irresponsible not to acknowledge that their task
              was made more difficult by groups like Sinn Féin/IRA and other
              terrorist organisations.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On reading the report it is clear that many of
              the jobs promised were never created and, indeed, that a large
              percentage of those that were created lasted only for a very short
              time. It is also alarming to note that not all the costs were
              incorporated into the cost-per-job calculation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition, it is surprising, to say the
              least, that the IDB does not use the Internet to market Northern
              Ireland. Mr&nbsp;Sammy&nbsp;Wilson made reference to this earlier,
              and I find it incredible that in this day and age the IDB has not
              been told that the Internet exists. However, I am sure that when
              they read this report, they too will discover that there are other
              ways of marketing Northern&nbsp;Ireland which they have not
              pursued to date.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I certainly agree with my Colleague,
              Ian&nbsp;Paisley, when he cited the IRA; his criticism of Sinn
              Féin is well placed. I am not a fan of the IDB, and, having read
              the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee report, I have to
              say that my feelings have not changed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The IDB undoubtedly has an extremely difficult
              task in job creation and no one — and I include myself here —
              should underestimate that, but the litany of concerns expressed
              throughout the report cannot be ignored. The Minister of
              Enterprise, Trade and Investment, Sir Reg&nbsp;Empey, will, no
              doubt, have given this report his careful consideration. Can this
              Assembly look forward to his considered response detailing what
              action he will be taking to ensure that such a report will not be
              necessary in the future? I hope that the Minister will take
              particular interest in the cost per job, which, though planned to
              be £37,900, was, in fact, £56,200. That is 50% more than the
              figure first suggested. I accept, of course, that the IDB is at
              the cutting edge of risk taking and is always going to be
              vulnerable to criticism, but I think it has to learn, if it has
              not done so already, that it is very easy to cut whangs off
              another man’s leather, but while they are custodians of public
              funds, they should keep that very much to the fore.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Billy&nbsp;Hutchinson made an excellent point
              regarding job announcements. We often hear announcements about
              thousands of jobs, but do we ever see thousands of jobs being
              created? When you look at the fine print you discover that
              thousands dwindle to hundreds or, indeed, to around 50. We need
              jobs that support the job creation schemes, targeting real areas
              of social need. Rural constituencies, like mine, that have very
              high unemployment figures must be looked at more carefully in the
              future. Let us see a fairer distribution of job creation. I
              believe, like Mr&nbsp;McCrea, that Londonderry has had more than
              its fair share. Other areas of Northern&nbsp;Ireland must also get
              their fair share of job creation and have money spent on them.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Shannon:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am also unable to support the motion for one
              simple reason, and that is that the organisation proposing it is
              the same one that for 30&nbsp;years, has subjected this country to
              all sorts of bombing, and as a result, our economy has been badly
              affected. That having been said, the IDB has not endeared itself
              to the people of the Province, and certainly not to the people of
              Strangford especially. The people of Northern Ireland have had to
              sit back and watch as the IDB has failed majestically to justify
              the amount of taxpayer money which was being spent on job creation
              to comparatively little effect.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.15 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Events on the ground have had a major economic
              impact on areas of Northern Ireland during 30&nbsp;years of a
              terrorism and bombing campaign. In Newtownards we had a bomb a few
              years ago that caused £5&nbsp;million worth of damage. Where
              could we have invested £5&nbsp;million in Newtownards? We could
              have opened further food-processing units to create employment; we
              could have used it to help the farming industry; we could have
              used it for the fishing industry; or we could have used it for the
              textile industry- all those industries that needed help. But,
              instead of being able to help them, the Government had to pay out
              £5&nbsp;million plus to the people who had suffered as a result
              of the bomb; a bomb planted by the IRA; a bomb planted to destroy
              the economic life of the centre of Newtownards.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the same time, over the last few years, the
              people of Strangford have had other large economic blackspots to
              contend with. The backbone of our rural economy is farming. It
              contributes a lot to the life of our constituency in both rural
              and urban areas. It has been devastated in recent years while a
              substantial part of the urban industry has been in textiles. Both
              industries, agriculture and textiles, are now under enormous
              pressure. The situation appears to be spiralling out of control,
              and we are now in the midst of a crisis, which will not only
              affect the individuals who have been told that they are to become
              redundant but will have an immensely negative impact upon the
              whole local economy.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Losses from the Bairdwear, Hawkes Bay and
              Lamont Holdings, (a Regency Spinners Group) have had a huge impact
              on the local economy. We have witnessed the loss of over 600 jobs
              within the clothing industry in the space of just a few months.
              From being a solid base for the industry, the Ards area now finds
              itself struggling to maintain any presence whatsoever.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What about the land that has been set aside by
              the IDB for development in Newtownards and Strangford? Firstly,
              not enough land has been set aside for development. Secondly, the
              land that is set aside is owned by the IDB and some of it is on a
              hill. It is going to be very difficult to build a factory on a
              hill. It is going to be almost impossible to prepare that site,
              and what is the IDB doing today? It should be preparing the ground
              so that if any factories do want to come in, we will be in a
              position to react. The conduct of the IDB at best has been
              unprofessional and at worst downright discriminating.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Financially, the loss of 600 jobs can only have
              a devastating effect upon the local economy and, as a result, it
              is estimated that £6·5&nbsp;million will be lost. The picture is
              the same right across Northern Ireland. From an internal point of
              view, part of the problem lies with the Robson index. There needs
              to be an urgent review of targeting social need as results do not
              appear to produce an accurate indication of social deprivation
              within any given area. There must be parity of social recognition
              between a disadvantaged person living in an area that is perceived
              to be affluent and a disadvantaged person in an area which is
              perceived to be disadvantaged.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Areas such as Ards and Strangford are perceived
              to be affluent, but one just has to look at the local housing
              estates to read a different story. The new system should be more
              effective at locating areas of social deprivation, but because
              this system will continue to work alongside local government and
              ward boundaries, a large number of areas in our constituency will
              continue to be ignored, being part of a ward which is perceived to
              be affluent when the reality is that a large proportion of that
              ward is anything but.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With the crisis in agriculture and the
              disintegration of the textile industry, unemployment figures for
              the borough are higher than the Northern Ireland average. I have
              heard some Members talking about unemployment today. Unemployment
              in our area is rising dramatically. Where the proportion of people
              claiming benefit is 5·7% in Northern Ireland as a whole, and
              5·2% in the Belfast travel-to-work area, the figure for the Ards
              borough is 6·7%, a figure that does not even take into account
              the most recent redundancies within textiles. The final figure is
              believed to be around a staggering 9·6%.- almost 10% in the Ards
              borough perceived to be an affluent area, but is anything but.
              There must be flexibility in Government policy or this system of
              TSN will continue to punish the people of Ards. These figures
              hardly show that the Ards borough or Strangford is an affluent
              area, a place where job opportunities are available, where
              everything is going well.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Even though the IDB played an important role in
              securing the future of Northern Ireland Spinners Ltd in Killinchy,
              it is clear that they have not delivered on their obligations to
              the people and the economy of Northern Ireland. They have done
              people in Strangford and across this Province a great disservice.
              Great swaths of jobs have gone, with few subsequent options or
              opportunities being made available to those laid off. This
              dreadfully unsatisfactory situation cannot be allowed to continue.
              Change is urgently required. Resolute and necessary action must be
              taken in order to enhance and rebuild the economy of Northern
              Ireland.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and
              Investment (Sir Reg Empey): </b>It has already been acknowledged
              that I find myself in something of a dilemma this afternoon. On
              one hand, I welcome the interest of the Public Accounts Committees
              of the House of Commons and of the Assembly in the work of the
              Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment in pursuit of
              better public services. On the other hand, with a memorandum of
              response to the Public Accounts Committee report not yet compiled,
              let alone agreed with the Department of Finance and Personnel and
              returned to the Committee, I am unable to enter fully into the
              debate or to inform Members as I would wish. I deeply regret this,
              because so many points have been made, and the debate has been of
              such a nature, that detailed answers are required.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is not my intention to be discourteous to
              the Public Accounts Committee of the House of Commons, which has
              made it clear that there is a procedure laid down for such
              responses. They are to be made within eight weeks. At this stage,
              IDB and the Department of Finance and Personnel have not yet
              completed the compilation of a response, and I cannot anticipate
              that response. I certainly cannot give detailed answers until that
              response has been handed to the Public Accounts Committee. I hope
              hon Members do not expect me to put the House in that difficult
              position.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, in the light of what has been said
              today, and without wishing to prejudice in any way the memorandum
              of response or to seem disrespectful to the Committee, I feel I
              must say something in general terms, if only to retain a sense of
              perspective.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Public Accounts Committee report covers the
              period April 1988 to March 1997. As will be seen in due course
              when the IDB makes its response, much progress has been made since
              then. Secondly, the difficult political and economic climate in
              which the IDB operated throughout most of this period is a factor
              that has been acknowledged by the Committee. The IDB’s approach
              to measuring the economic efficiency of new inward investment
              cases now mirrors that undertaken elsewhere in the United Kingdom.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issue of jobs promoted was referred to on a
              number of occasions. It is a common means of measuring the
              performance of industrial development agencies throughout the
              United Kingdom. The actual rate of conversion to jobs created by
              IDB inward investments is 76%, which compares very favourably with
              Scotland and Wales. If Members refer to the report, they will see
              that this point is acknowledged.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Pay-outs on letters of offer are triggered by
              each company’s performance in delivering agreed targets. There
              seems to be a perception that, just because a deal is struck on a
              certain number of jobs that are to be created, the money agreed is
              automatically paid over. That is not the case. The money is only
              paid over when certain targets are actually met. If they are not
              met, funds are not paid to the companies concerned.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, the IDB has worked very hard to
              maximise job creation in TSN areas. Again, this has been
              acknowledged. I agree with Members who said that this in itself is
              a subject for debate. I hope shortly to come to comments made by
              individual Members, including Mr Shannon.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The PAC report on inward investment raises
              important issues and will receive my full attention. Where there
              is room for improvement, I will ensure that progress is made. The
              IDB has an important role to play in helping to build the local
              economy, and I look forward to working with the Enterprise, Trade
              and Investment Committee and the Public Accounts Committee to
              maximise its effectiveness. I do not wish to get into a blow by
              blow account of every point in the report. A number of comments
              were made throughout the debate and I would like to refer now to
              some of those.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I begin by referring to the comments by the hon
              Member for North Antrim, Ian&nbsp;Paisley&nbsp;Jnr, when he
              specifically referred to the Moyle area of his constituency and
              what he considered to be an inadequate response by the IDB to the
              difficulties there. I am very much aware that Moyle has taken over
              from Strabane as the highest unemployment local council area in
              the Province. That is something I deeply regret. The hon&nbsp;Member
              for North Antrim will be aware that, in the short period since
              devolution has been restored, I have visited Moyle because of an
              unfortunate incident at the Giant’s Causeway visitor centre. I
              believe there is considerable potential for employment, especially
              out of that tragedy, which has the potential for a significant
              investment.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member for East Antrim, Mr&nbsp;Neeson,
              made some remarks about ‘Strategy 2010’ and tax-raising and
              tax-varying powers. I know that he and his party have been
              advocates of this policy for a long time. While it is something
              that we will have to come to on another day, my concern is that
              tax-varying powers would equate to tax-raising powers, because the
              temptation to increase taxes for public expenditure would be
              inevitable. One needs to be very careful not to create a
              disincentive to investment, because the stresses and strains
              between demands for public expenditure and competitive rates will
              be very strong. As Members know, the Republic has attracted
              companies on the basis of a lower rate through its corporation
              tax. My concern would be that if we had tax-varying powers that
              were not corporation tax-varying powers, these would become tax
              increases and therefore a disincentive, doing the very opposite of
              what the Republic has been successful in doing by using its
              corporation tax variants.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A number of Members have referred to the
              circumstances that the IDB and, indeed, LEDU find themselves in
              with regard to the issues surrounding violence and disorder.
              Though he is not in the Chamber, the hon&nbsp;Member for North
              Belfast, Mr&nbsp;Hutchinson, seemed to make light of this, that it
              did not matter so much what the IRA or the Loyalists did. You
              cannot ignore these things. When I was Lord&nbsp;Mayor of Belfast
              I had visitors and potential investors in the parlour when the
              windows rattled, and I had to try to explain that to them. Nobody
              in their right mind could imagine that a terrorist war, which has
              waged for three decades, would not have any impact whatsoever on
              inward investment. It is absolute nonsense to suggest it. Most of
              today’s investment is mobile and it can go anywhere. Nobody is
              going to be content to invest in an area which is patrolled by
              armoured cars, where buildings are surrounded by cages, and where
              people are constantly sweeping up the rubble and the glass and
              having to spend hours upon hours of management time on claims and
              trying to rebuild their businesses. So to say that this is of no
              account is patent nonsense. That would be obvious to anybody. A
              number of Members have made that point. I do not propose to refer
              to each one of them individually, but it is important that we
              understand that that has been a consistent factor.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The other issue that must be understood is that
              the morale of the people who are going out to market and sell
              Northern Ireland, whether as a tourist or industrial destination,
              has to be taken into consideration. Whether we like it or not, the
              pattern in North America and other markets for years has been that
              whenever you say you are from Northern Ireland the people look at
              you and start to talk. What do they talk about? They do not start
              by talking about the Giant’s Causeway or the great weather —
              they ask &quot;Is the war on?&quot; and enquire about people’s
              safety. There are questions like that before one even gets to
              discuss the investments.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thank God, I believe that that is changing.
              However, this report covers the period from 1988 onwards, and
              therefore covers some of the worst periods of the troubles. To
              imagine that this could have taken place without any reference to
              difficulties is clearly wrong. The hon Member for East Belfast,
              Mr&nbsp;Sammy Wilson, referred to the Internet. It may well be
              that that hon Member chooses to spend his time on the Internet on
              other matters, but I can assure him that the IDB is very much on
              the Internet. If I could tear him away from some of the other
              sites he might be visiting, I suggest that he visit the site
              because in January this year I launched an upgraded site for the
              IDB. It is a very good site, and I would commend it to Members.
              The hon Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone also referred to it,
              and, if he chooses to look it up, he will find a very positive
              site there presenting a very positive image of Northern Ireland.
              Indeed, our Internet marketing is moving forward very strongly.
              There is a team in IDB House that takes this matter very
              seriously, and I believe that when the Member looks up the site he
              will be impressed by what he sees.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I appreciate that, and we will come back to it
              on another occasion. The hon Member for South Belfast, Dr
              McDonnell, talked about more risk taking, refocusing, and a more
              comprehensive debate. One of the criticisms I have of the motion
              is its timing, because we are in a position where, for
              parliamentary protocol reasons, I am replying in this debate with
              both hands tied behind my back; I regret that. The other matter is
              that the IDB and the Department of Finance and Personnel do not
              yet have their major piece of input in front of this Assembly. I
              know that Committees will want to engage in that, and that Members
              will want to have a full, free and open debate. I repeat that I do
              not intend to insult Members of Parliament and the Committee
              structure at Westminster, because I believe it would be a very
              short-term gain to do so.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some people have perhaps misunderstood what has
              been happening, even in their own areas. Although this report is
              specifically about the IDB’s performance, Members must remember
              that the largest performance and most significant number of jobs
              created are by the private sector and the public sector, in the
              natural course of events and under their own steam. IDB client
              companies and LEDU client companies only represent part of the
              economy. Not every company receives money and not every company
              asks for money. Indeed, the majority of companies do not do so.
              That, of course, is where most jobs are actually created.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to refer to a number of points that were
              made by the hon Member for Mid Ulster, Mr&nbsp;McCrea, who,
              unfortunately, is not with us at the moment. He was very concerned
              that west of the Bann got a particularly raw deal and he claimed
              that a large part of the money was going into a particular part of
              one constituency. Indeed, listening to the complaints of the hon
              Member for Foyle, Mrs Nelis, you would think she did not get
              daylight up there. She should have known better because I sent her
              a reply to a written question recently. I have been looking at the
              Foyle constituency’s slice of the cake in the five years from
              1995/1996 onwards.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1995-96 the Foyle constituency’s selective
              financial assistance from the Industrial Development Board (IDB)
              totalled almost £21 million, and that left Foyle in number two
              position in Northern Ireland. In 1996-97 it received £8·1
              million, leaving it in eighth position. In 1997-98 it received
              £51·6 million, leaving it in first position. In 1998-99 it
              received £3·9&nbsp;million, leaving it in eighth position. Last
              year it received £5·6 million, leaving it in fifth position. On
              average that puts it in the top quartile in every one of the last
              five years, and I do not consider that as paying scant regard to
              the area. In terms of Local Enterprise Development Unit (LEDU)
              performance, it is averaging 7% over the last six years as well.
              In other words, it is very much on a par there as well.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to what Mr McCrea was saying about
              his constituency, sadly, it did not receive any selective
              financial assistance from the IDB last year. But in 1995-96 it was
              in third position with £15 million; that dropped to £2·3
              million in 1996-97; £1·3 million in both 1997-98 and 1998-99,
              and nothing in the last financial year. Therefore, he probably has
              a point about more recent years. But take some other
              constituencies, Strangford, for example, which in 1995 received
              nothing, in 1996 received £1·5 million, in 1997 £1·4 million,
              in 1998 £0·16 million, and last year just under a million. There
              are many other constituencies in weaker positions. In terms of
              LEDU —</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister must look at the unemployment
              figures as well. Taking those into account, the Foyle Constituency’s
              assistance level was one of the lowest.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The impression was given clearly in the debate
              that there is considerable grievance that the Foyle Constituency
              is doing very badly out of all of this. I am simply saying that
              the arithmetic in front of me does not sustain that. That is the
              reality. It is there in black and white. Of course you must relate
              things to unemployment, as you do to a range of other matters too.
              This is because deprivation can take a range of forms. The point I
              am making is that it is perfectly clear that both LEDU and IDB
              recognise the difficulties that constituency has.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What people must remember about all of this is
              that the demand for selective financial assistance comes from
              companies. Projects and expansions have to be there and coming
              forward. The IDB cannot unilaterally produce a result and cede
              money going to a particular Constituency. It has to come from
              demand from particular companies, and I believe there has been a
              significant response over recent years in that Constituency. It is
              in the reply, which is in the public domain.</p>

              business. It is a pity that the same Member of Parliament, prior
              to reorganisation, forgot that Strabane was part of his
              constituency.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is what you call an up-and-under. A former
              rugby commentator used to come out with that one. I take seriously
              the difficulties the hon Member has in his constituency, and he
              knows that I will see some of his Colleagues this week in regard
              to some of those matters. I visited the area when I was in this
              position the last time we had devolution, and I am conscious of
              the difficulties. Although this was an answer to a particular
              Member, it might be useful to have this set of statistics, broken
              down into district council areas, submitted and circulated to all
              Members. It would be a reference point, and it might be useful for
              Members to have a ready reckoner at their disposal so that they
              could refer to it and see how things are moving.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member for east Antrim, Mr&nbsp;Beggs,
              referred to the difficulties in his area, and I direct my response
              to him and Mr&nbsp;Shannon, from Strangford. North Down, Ards and
              Carrick have some of the highest male unemployment rates in the
              Province. There is a hidden problem in areas in the Greater
              Belfast commuter belt; a two-speed constituency is developing.
              There are those who are indigenous to the constituency, who work
              and live in it, and there are those who reside in the constituency
              but do not work in it, and I have noticed this particularly in the
              Strangford area.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I visited Strangford as a result of the crisis
              in the textile industry to liase with the borough council over
              their difficulties in that regard, and it was obvious that many of
              the staple industries (agriculture, fishing and textiles) have
              been taking a hammering, but because there is a growing proportion
              of the population in those districts — and this applies equally
              in North Down — of those who reside in the constituency but do
              not live in it, that disguises the underlying difficulties in the
              economy in those two areas. A lot of that also applies to the
              constituency of East Antrim. When we look at the Robson index and
              the indices of deprivation, we see that this is one of the pockets
              of deprivation that are located in the middle of areas of apparent
              affluence.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When we come to deal with the new TSN issue
              these are matters we will have to address and be honest about.
              Instead of taking the global statistics, which can be misleading,
              we must remember that it does not matter where a person is, if
              that person is in a situation where he is being deprived and has
              no opportunities or skills, then we are tasked to do our best to
              provide him with opportunities. It does not matter whether he is
              in Upper Malone or in any other ward, everybody should have an
              equal opportunity to improve and get themselves out of a
              particular difficulty. That is not going to be done simply by
              using a blunt instrument such as some of the statistical methods
              that are currently at our disposal. But perhaps that is a debate
              for another day.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For reasons that I have made clear, I have not
              been able to be as responsive to the matters referred to during
              the debate in respect of the IDB’s performance, and I apologise
              for that. I hope we will return to this in the next session when
              we will have had the opportunity to go through the report with the
              clear advantage of a response from the IDB and DFP and with the
              knowledge of the considered position of the Public Accounts
              Committee in London. The reasons I have stipulated together with
              the matters referred to by the hon Member for Lagan Valley,
              Mr&nbsp;Bell, mean that I am therefore unable to support this

              disappointed that the Chairman of our Public Accounts Committee
              intends to wait for the procedure to go through Westminster. The
              wording of the motion was chosen carefully in the light of the
              recommendation from the Select Committee at Westminster to our
              Public Accounts Committee asking it to keep a watching brief on
              the matter. That recommendation still stands and is very
              pertinent.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some good comments were made, and overall
              people showed serious concern about the performance and activities
              of the IDB. The concern is mainly about the figures for job
              creation and job promotion, the lack of accountability and the
              lack of response to Committees, such as that at Westminster, but
              it also centres around the lack of adherence to equality issues
              and TSN.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was glad to hear John Dallat say that he is
              on the Auditor General’s committee. He said that the Auditor
              General is not only capable but willing to deal with this and
              other issues and that our Public Accounts Committee has a critical
              role to play.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some very sensible comments were made, and I
              was glad to hear that contributors like Ian Paisley Jnr agreed
              that this was an indictment of the failure of the IDB and a
              catalogue of shame. Unfortunately, Mr&nbsp;Paisley, along with
              other Members of his party, then reverted to type and came out
              with comments that were typical of the DUP — for his information
              I have read the report, and that is why the motion is worded as it
              is.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the other comments about my part
              in putting down the motion, I would remind some parties that they
              have sailed very close to the wind. I need only mention the DUP’s
              involvement with Ulster&nbsp;Resistance and its support for the
              Orange Order and others in their attempts to bring this place to a
              standstill. Given that economic development was linked to
              political stability, it might be helpful if Mr&nbsp;Paisley and
              Mr&nbsp;Wilson’s Colleagues took their seats in the Executive
              and projected a more positive image. The DUP’s response to the
              motion was interesting. It shows its difficulty in dealing with
              sensible and normal motions — the DUP always has to bring
              everything back to the confrontational politics with which it is
              most comfortable.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As time goes on, the stresses and strains in
              that party will increase as normal politics begin to bed down. By
              way of a reminder to that party, and to the other people who
              questioned our putting this motion down, my party and I are here
              because of an electoral mandate. We are entitled to be here, and
              we are entitled to bring forward and debate areas of concern, and
              that is something my Colleagues and I will continue to do.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In winding up, I thank the Minister for his
              reply. I am pleased that he said that he will be giving the Public
              Accounts Committee’s report his full attention. Perhaps he will
              reply by way of a written answer to my question.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We were talking about statistics and I think it
              is true that you can have &quot;lies, damned lies and
              statistics&quot;. How much of the overall IDB budget is spent east
              of the Bann and how much is spent west of the Bann? I am glad that
              these issues were raised. They are very serious issues. The IDB
              has been in existence since 1982 and there has been little
              accountability and I think that it is important that the Assembly
              begins to take control of issues such as the IDB. I am glad that
              this motion was made and I urge people to support it. Go raibh
              maith agat.</p>
