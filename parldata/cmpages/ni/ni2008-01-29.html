	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The Assembly met at 10.30 am (Mr Speaker in the  Chair).</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Members observed two minutes&rsquo; silence.</p>
	      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="1"></a>Ministerial Statement</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Seaport Investments Ltd: <br>
	        Planning Application</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Speaker: I have received notice from the Minister of  the Environment, Mrs Arlene Foster, that she wishes to make a statement on the  decision that she has taken on a major planning application by Seaport  Investments Ltd for a visitor and study centre on land that is adjacent to the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway world heritage site.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">The Minister of the Environment (Mrs Foster): I am  making this statement on the outcome of my consideration of the planning  application by Seaport Investments Ltd to construct a new visitor and study  centre at the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway world heritage  site.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">To say that there has been considerable interest in, and  comment on, the application in recent months is an understatement. Much of that  interest has been wholly irrelevant to my consideration of the planning merits  of the application. For that reason, it is important to set out the materially  relevant facts of that period, which led me to the conclusion that I am  announcing today.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In a public statement on 10 September 2007, I said:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;I have recently received a report from the Planning  Service on a planning application by Seaport Investments Ltd for a new Visitor  and Study Centre at the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway World  Heritage Site. I have given this report my fullest consideration and have also  taken the opportunity to visit the site.</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">Having done so, I have concluded that there is  considerable merit in what is proposed and I am of a mind to approve it.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I said that I was &ldquo;of a mind&rdquo; to approve the  application, not &ldquo;minded&rdquo; to do so.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although Seaport Investments Ltd submitted an <span style="letter-spacing:-.05pt; ">outline rather than a full proposal, given the  speculation</span> and comment in the media &mdash; and elsewhere &mdash;during the summer  about visitor facilities at the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway,  I felt that it was important to make my view public. The proposal attempted to  minimise the visual <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt; ">intrusiveness of what  was planned; it had an imaginative</span> design; it provided extensive  facilities; and it attempted to resolve access issues by devising new road  arrangements.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, I also stated clearly that I had concerns about  some aspects of the proposal. I quote again from my statement of 10 September:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;I have asked my officials to engage with the  developer and key local stakeholders on some aspects of the proposal so that I  can make a formal decision on it at the earliest opportunity.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The three key local stakeholders were the  developer, the National Trust and Moyle District Council. I, therefore, made it  equally clear that no decision had <span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt; ">been  made on the application and, indeed, that a decision</span> would not be made  until I had received a further report from my officials. Regrettably, that  point was missed by a lot of commentators and, indeed, by Members of the House.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The aspects of the proposal to be further considered were  its impact on the world heritage site; its ability to integrate into the  landscape; its relationship to other developments in the area; and its  relationship to the existing visitors&rsquo; centre.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My officials&rsquo; engagement with the key stakeholders has been  completed, and I have received their report on the outcome and their  reassessment of the application in light of that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Discussions with the stakeholders revealed a significant  amount of common ground. All three valued the world heritage site status; all  three agreed on the value of the landscape and the need to minimise  development; and all three considered that there should be only one visitor  facility at the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway, that it  should be world class and that it should be provided as soon as possible.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, there was no consensus on the way in which those  agreed goals might be achieved. Indeed, the possible solutions suggested in  relation to the proposal were mutually exclusive and there was no evidence from  my officials&rsquo; discussions with the stakeholders that any of them would be  acceptable or that agreement was a realistic possibility.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Against that background, I have reconsidered the Planning  Service&rsquo;s report and recommendation on the proposal, which I received in June last  year, together with the further report on  engagement with the applicant, the National Trust and Moyle District  Council, and the Planning Service&rsquo;s subsequent reassessment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although I still see considerable merit in the proposal, I  consider that that does not outweigh the planning concerns that I continue to  have about it and which clearly are not capable of being addressed to my  satisfaction. I am convinced that the proposal, as it stands, would have an  adverse impact on the world heritage site, as I believe that it could adversely  affect the character of the area. There are serious doubts that the proposed  development would adequately integrate into the landscape, and it would add to  the spread of development at this sensitive location. I have, therefore,  concluded on balance and on further reflection that the application should be  refused.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In reaching that conclusion, I have also considered the  need for a local public inquiry. However, I am satisfied that all  representations on the proposal have been properly considered and that all  other materially relevant planning considerations have been taken into account.  I, therefore, feel that there are no other issues <span style="letter-spacing:-.25pt; ">that would merit or require further examination or inquiry.</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In light of that, I have decided that a notice of opinion  to refuse the application should be issued to the applicant, and I have  instructed my officials to proceed on that basis.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">The Chairperson of the Committee for the Environment  (Mr McGlone): Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for  bringing the matter before the House today. As Members will be aware, the  Committee for the Environment has been seeking extensive detail on the planning  application for a considerable time. That work has culminated in the Committee&rsquo;s  recent decision to apply for full openness and disclosure under section 44 of  the Northern Ireland Act 1998. I am glad that that course of action may have  acted as a catalyst for bringing the matter to the House today.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister state what opinions and views were given  both in her Department and to her Department that to proceed with the planning  application could put the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway&rsquo;s  status as a world heritage site in jeopardy? I note that she referred to a lot  of commentators and Members of the House missing the point that no decision had  been made. Did that apply equally to the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment, who clearly was interpreting her as saying that she was minded to  approve the planning application?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In relation to the application for outline planning  permission at the site, will the Minister clarify whether her officials have  engaged in any discussions with a developer or developers about a further  proposal or amended proposal on the site at the Giant&rsquo;s   Causeway?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, is the culmination of events today a case of  saying, &ldquo;Junior, this is another fine mess you&rsquo;ve got me into&rdquo;? Go raibh maith  agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mrs Foster: I am disappointed that the Committee  Chairperson should make such a statement when he knows full well that the  decision has been made on planning grounds alone. On 10 September 2007, I said  that my initial decision was that I was &ldquo;of a mind to approve&rdquo; the application.  I stated clearly that it was not a formal decision but an opinion and that my  Department would enter into a process to seek the views of the other  stakeholders about the difficulties. The Chairperson knows that when I attended  the Environment Committee meeting on 20 September 2007 to discuss the matter, I  set out the four issues that I referred to in my statement today. It should  come as no surprise to him that the world heritage site is one of those issues.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">During the time that the process was continuing between  Planning Service and the stakeholders, I took the opportunity to visit the Jurassic Coast  in the south of England,  another world heritage site of natural distinction, to see what was being done  there to protect the world heritage status. I found that visit very helpful to me in coming to the decision that I announced  today.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Chairperson asked about the existence of an alternative  proposal on the horizon and whether there have been any discussions about that.  I have had no discussions about an alternative proposal. I considered the  existing application on its own merits, as I am legally bound to do. I reached  my decision based on a careful assessment of  the views of the Planning Service, of the consultees and the  representations received from right across Northern Ireland. It should come as  no surprise to the Chairperson that my  decision was based solely on the planning application that was in front  of me. I have always been very careful and very straight about the issue.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to the responsibilities of other Ministers, I  am sure that the Committee Chairperson will have an opportunity to ask them  about their position on visitor centre facilities. My concern is the planning  issue. It has always been a planning issue, and that will continue to be the  case.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Speaker: Although I have allowed the Chairperson of  the Committee for the Environment some latitude in his questions to the  Minister, I have to say to other Members that I expect them to ask specific  question on the statement and not to go all around the world. I warn the House  about that matter.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Weir: Mr Speaker, I shall try to keep my question  rooted in the north coast.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I commend the Minister on her statement. She has expressed  a considered opinion and not a knee-jerk reaction, as has sometimes been the  case in the House, and taken a decision based firmly and clearly on planning  grounds. In light of today&rsquo;s decision and a commitment to release papers once  that decision had been taken, will the Minister say whether she regards the  decision of the Environment Committee, taken a mere week and a half ago,  against clear-cut legal advice, to seek a section 44 application, to be &mdash; and  to put it at its most generous &mdash; premature?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mrs Foster: I thank the Member for his comments. I have  always made it clear that everything would be released once the decision had  been taken. That decision has been taken as of today. Therefore, all documents  will be made available to the Environment Committee and to anybody else who  wishes to view them. I expect a long queue outside Millennium House over the  next few days.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to the proposed action of the Environment  Committee, I understand that its legal advice was that such action was  premature. My legal advice said that it was premature. I was disappointed, to  say the least, that the Committee decided to go down a political route to try  to get those papers, when I knew fine well that that was not going to be the  case.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It was premature, because a decision is necessary to get  papers of that kind, and no decision had been made &mdash; until today. I reiterate:  that decision has been made and those papers will be made available.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">10.45 am</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr McKay: Go raibh  maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I echo other Members who have spoken in  welcoming the Minister&rsquo;s statement. It goes without saying that much of what  has happened in the past four months has damaged public confidence in the  Planning Service. Today&rsquo;s decision will help to ensure protection of the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway&rsquo;s world heritage status. It is a good  decision <span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt; ">for the Causeway, and in the eyes  of the local community</span>, and sends a clear message that relationships between  Assembly Members and developers cannot be used to override the Planning  Service&rsquo;s integrity, independence and transparency. I, therefore, welcome the  Minister&rsquo;s decision, and move on to my question.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister said that she will make available all the  documents requested by the Committee for the Environment. Will she make those  available to the Assembly today? Can she confirm that the manage&shy;ment board of  the Planning Service, early in 2007, recommended that the application be  refused?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mrs Foster: I have already said that the papers will be  made available; however, administrative issues must be sorted out. The Member  knows well that the file was brought to the Committee for the Environment to  allow members to inspect it. I am happy to offer that facility again; I am sure  that my officials will bring the file again, should the Committee want it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I do not accept that people have no confidence in the  Planning Service. Today&rsquo;s decision is an indication of the Planning Service  working well with key local stakeholders, and the Member had comments to make when that process was ongoing. That process,  however, has borne fruit, in the elements that I mentioned &mdash; for  example, recognition of the value of the world heritage status is very  important to those who live in that area, and I am sure that the Member will  acknowledge that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member commented on the advice given to me by Planning  Service officials on receiving the report in June 2007. As he well knows, I  made no decision until today; therefore, I did not go against advice from  Planning Service officials. I considered the advice then, and again, having  reflected on the process that I began, and I came to my decision today. When  the Member sees the report from the Planning Service, he will know what was said  to me, and he may well see the direction that the process was taking.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr McFarland: I  welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement. It  is good that common sense has, eventually, prevailed. The issue began in  2002 and, since then, Ian Paisley Jnr has lobbied extensively &mdash; Prime  Ministers, Presidents, or whatever &mdash; but we know, because both Ministers &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic"><span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Some Members: Ask the question.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr McFarland: Mr Speaker, I need to sort of lead into  it &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic"><span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Speaker: Order. I  have always allowed Members some latitude in getting to their questions.  However, we do not want statements further to the Minister&rsquo;s statement. We  expect questions on that statement.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr McFarland: Mr Speaker, I agree. However, there must  be a context to a question, otherwise no one can understand why it is asked.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">A Member: The statement is the context.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr McFarland: Right, I shall ask my question. What was  the unseen factor that allowed the Minister to make her decision in September  2007, against the advice of the Environment and Heritage Service (EHS) and the  expectation of her Department, as indicated in a memo? What factor has no one else seen that allowed her to be  minded to give that decision in September?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mrs Foster: There is a couple of issues there, and I am  sorry that the Member did not hear the statement. Perhaps he has difficulty  with hearing: I am not sure.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I said that a decision was not taken in September &mdash; and I  repeat, was not taken in September. Moreover, I said that I was &ldquo;of a mind&rdquo;; I  did not say that I was &ldquo;minded&rdquo;. Frankly, one gets rather fed up of being  wrongly quoted by other Assembly Members. Really, they must see &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">A Member: Deliberately.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mrs Foster: Deliberately: that is absolutely correct.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In September, I said that the proposal had considerable  merit, and I still believe that. I want to outline that considerable merit,  although I have said it in the statement. Clearly, again, Members were not  listening to the statement, although they have it in front of them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although the proposal was at outline stage, it was clear to  me that attempts had been made to minimise the visual intrusiveness of the  proposed centre by grassing over roofs and  exposed surfaces and by locating part  of the car park underground. It had a very imaginative design, as I am  sure those who have looked at it will agree. It provided extensive facilities  for visitors to the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway, with an  auditorium, cafe and library, and attempted to resolve access issues with new  road arrangements that were to be put in place as a result of the development.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are no hidden factors in this statement today. I said  what I said in September because I thought that the proposal had merit. I asked  people to go away and look at it and to engage with local stakeholders to see whether the four other issues that I outlined to  the Environment Committee could be dealt with. Unfortunately, they could  not be dealt with, and, therefore, we are in the position where we have had  this decision today.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Ford: I am sure that the Minister will be pleased to  know that I, too, welcome her statement today, even if it is somewhat belated. </p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, is it not the case that her announcement of 10  September totally failed to take account of the concerns of UNESCO, the seven  serious grounds for refusal that were laid out by the Environment and Heritage  Service and the draft northern area plan &mdash; a material consideration at that  time? What has changed between then and now that has meant that she has finally  announced the right decision, having said that she was of a mind to take the  wrong decision? In particular, does this not illustrate that there is a serious  environmental protection issue in the way in which the Planning Service deals  with key issues such as the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway?  This was not simply a planning application; it was a matter of environmental  protection policy that needed to be fully discussed.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mrs Foster: I think that this has been the most  discussed planning application in the history of time, so that last point is  completely out of order.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In relation to my decision&rsquo;s being &ldquo;belated&rdquo;, I announced  on 10 September that I was &ldquo;of a mind&rdquo;. A process then took place. That process  was completed at the end of November. The Planning Service then reflected and  sent me a report in, I think, the middle of January. I then came to the  decision that I have announced today. I do not think that I could have done it  any more quickly and, frankly, I would not have wanted to, because this is a  very important application.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Ford: I did not ask about speed.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mrs Foster: He did ask about speed; I think that the  Hansard report will show that he said &ldquo;belated&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Obviously UNESCO, EHS and the draft northern area plan are  all issues that I have considered, both in June, when I received the initial  report, and since receiving the final report from Planning Service today. I  have taken them all on board, and they are reflected in my decision.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As for Mr Ford&rsquo;s comments about the need for more  independence, he is very creative in his arguments for an environmental  protection agency (EPA), but even Members of this House will think that it is a  bit tenuous to be arguing for an EPA on a decision &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Ford: I did not mention it.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mrs Foster: You did mention independence. Again, Mr  Speaker, the Hansard report will show that. I listen to people who make  comments, unlike some Members of this House who do not.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Ford: Nobody is saying that.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mrs Foster: I am saying that the EHS has made points to  me. Those will be made available so that people can see what they are. The  Council for Nature Conservation and the Countryside, which is my statutory  advisory body, made two reports to me on those issues. That independent  statutory advisory committee has also advised me on this matter.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Ross: Although some Members will attempt to make  cheap political points, I am particularly disappointed that the Chairperson of  the Environment Committee, speaking in that capacity, has tried to do so. It is  important to note that since the Minister&rsquo;s statement in September, there has  been much discussion about the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway  site, which has been slightly rich &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Some Members: Question.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Speaker: Order, order. Minister?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Ross: I have not actually asked the question yet.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Speaker: Again, there would be less trouble if  Members would just come to their questions.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Ross: As I was saying, there has been lots of  discussion about the site, despite the fact that there had not been for many  years before. That is a positive development. We have heard many proposals, even  if there is no substance there.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Some Members: Question.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Ross: With that in mind, Mr Speaker, have the  proposals that have been mooted in the past weeks and months had any bearing on  the decision that the Minister has announced today?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mrs Foster: I am sorry to say that I did not hear the  question. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Speaker: Order.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Ross: We have engaged in a great deal of discussion  about the matter over the past weeks and months, which did not happen  previously, and we have heard that other people have submitted proposals, even  if there is little substance to them. Given that, have those proposals affected  in any way the decision that the Minister has announced today?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mrs Foster: Absolutely not. Since the beginning of the  process, I have stated that the decision on this application must be made on  its own merits. After 10 September, there were some rumblings about other  proposals being submitted, but I have received no other formal applications.  Had I received any such applications from other developers, they would not have  had a bearing on this application. That is because each must be judged on its  own merits.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr P Maskey: Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I  was &ldquo;of a mind&rdquo; to thank the Minister for her  statement, but now I have decided that I will thank her.<span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Unlike other Members, I will ask my question quickly. The  planning aspect of the issue is important for tourism. Given that we need a  resolution to this for the benefit of tourists who will come to the North, will  the Minister work closely on the matter  with her colleague the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment? We  must ensure that we proceed carefully and work closely with the other  stakeholders, including Moyle District Council and the National Trust.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mrs Foster: I am only too happy to work on this matter  with the Minister of Enterprise,  Trade and Investment, who I see has just arrived in the Chamber. In the near future, a planning policy statement  (PPS) on tourism will be published. I know that the Department of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment is looking forward to the publication of that PPS so that we can  discuss how the relevant tourism issues pertain to planning.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A great deal was made of the fact that before I made my &ldquo;of a mind&rdquo; decision on 10 September, I had  actually had the temerity to speak to my Executive colleague about the  planning application that we are discussing. That is called joined-up  Government; I will continue to be involved in that process, and I will continue  to talk to my colleagues about the issues that are relevant to them. On matters  that are solely within the remit of my Department, such as planning matters, I  will seek my own guidance and that of the Planning Service.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr I McCrea: Again, unlike other Members, I will not  attempt to make any cheap political points.<span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Having said that, I will ask my question directly. We know  that concerns have been expressed about this application, so will the Minister  tell the House whether she will take that  into account when considering similar applications that relate to the  location in question?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mrs Foster: As I have said already, each application  that is submitted for a development in any location, including the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway area, is treated on its own merits. The Giant&rsquo;s Causeway is a sensitive location in that it is  our only world heritage site &mdash; although I hope that that will change and that  we will have more. I know that certain areas in Northern Ireland are seeking world  heritage site designation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, any other application that I receive for  proposed developments at the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway  must fit the criteria that I have talked about today. Those include, as Mr Ford  said, the draft northern area plan, UNESCO&rsquo;s  check list for world heritage site designation, and, obviously, any  concerns that EHS has about that environmentally sensitive area will be related  to me.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Armstrong: Despite Ian Paisley Jnr&rsquo;s having lobbied everyone else in the universe on the  application for a development at the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway, will the Minister  confirm that not a word passed between her and Mr Paisley Jnr on the matter  before September? Does the Minister agree that, had she made a decision on the  matter four months ago, she would have spared her party a great deal of  embarrassment?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Speaker: Order.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">11.00 am</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mrs Foster: I thought that I had made it clear that  this issue was not about party-political point-scoring, nor was it about  anything other than the planning application that was submitted to me &mdash; the  only application that was submitted to me in connection with the world heritage  site. </p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As I said on 10 September 2007, I was concerned that since  2000, there have been no visitors&rsquo; centre facilities of a world-class standard  at the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway. I attempted to deal  with the issues connected to the planning application that had been submitted  to me. On reflection, and having received the Planning Service&rsquo;s report, I have  had to turn down that proposal. That means that, at present, no applications  have been submitted in relation to the world heritage site at the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway. I hope that that will change soon.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr O&rsquo;Loan: Like others, I welcome this decision and the  Minister&rsquo;s statement. Three DUP Ministers have dug deep holes for themselves at  the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway; Mrs Foster has, very  wisely, stopped digging; the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment can  certainly get out of the hole that he created; however, I am less confident  about the position of the third Minister. </p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Will Mrs Foster now  agree that her &ldquo;minded&rdquo; decision of 10 September 2007 was fundamentally  wrong for two reasons: first, it depended on getting the agreement of Moyle  District Council and the National Trust, which had not even been tested, never  mind obtained; secondly, she says herself in her reasons for refusal that the  proposal: </p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;could adversely affect the character of the area&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">and that</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;There are serious doubts that the proposed  development would adequately integrate into the landscape and it would add to  the spread of development at this sensitive location.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister agree with me that all that infor&shy;mation  was available before 10 September 2007 and was provided to her by her  departmental officials?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Bearing in mind that there is an offer from the National  Trust, with the full co-operation of Moyle District Council, to adopt the  public-sector proposal &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">A Member: It is about time.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr O&rsquo;Loan: It is a very welcome development. Will the  Minister give her full support to that project, and will she facilitate, fully  and rapidly, a planning application for it? Will she give full support in the  Executive to the development of that proposal to ensure that a visitors&rsquo; centre  at the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway is built and opened in  the lifetime of this Assembly?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mrs Foster: I hope that the Member is not suggesting  that I consider an application other than on strict planning grounds. That is  not what I am going to do. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">A Member: Favouritism.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mrs Foster: If a formal application is submitted, I  will consider it in the same way and on the same grounds as I would any other.  There will be no favouritism for any application.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member said that I should not have embarked on the  process that the Planning Service embarked on in September 2007 because it had  not been tested. However, the point was to  test the grounds for agreement. As I said in my statement, agreement was  reached on matters relating to the world heritage status of the site and on  other issues. The Member claims that the information was available to me at  that time, and he is right. A great deal of information was available to me at  that time, but I wanted to establish whether there was any leeway on the part  of the landowners &mdash; the National Trust and  Moyle District Council &mdash; and whether there was a willingness to develop  what the Member so rightly wants to see at the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway: a world-class  visitors&rsquo; centre for everyone who visits it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Giant&rsquo;s Causeway is  our top tourist attraction, yet it does not have a world-class visitors&rsquo;  centre. That should concern all of us. It was incumbent on me to find a way  through the problem. No other applications have been received to date.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that an application will very soon be lodged that is  of a quality that can have the support of the Planning Service and everyone in  the House so that we can move forward with this matter.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Boylan: Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I  want to score some political points this morning. I commend the work of my  colleague Daith&iacute; McKay. He was referred to in a Committee meeting as a  one-trick pony, but he has romped home on this matter; if I were a betting man,  I would be in pocket.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the statement from the Minister. After months of  speculation, a decision has finally been made that is based on planning policy,  rather than on any outside influence. In the Programme for Government, the  Minister &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Some Members: Where is the question?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Boylan: I am coming to the question now. Mr Speaker,  you showed some latitude to other Members.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It appears from the Programme for Government that there  will be an overhaul of the Planning Service. Can the Minister assure the House  that proper measures will be put in place to ensure that, in the interests of  the public, applications will be processed and assessed in an open and transparent manner? Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mrs Foster: There is a little thing called freedom of  information. It will come as no surprise to hear that my Department receives  more freedom of information requests than  any other, the reason being that it has responsibility for the planning  system and the Planning Service. People have the right to ask questions about  planning applications &mdash; and rightly so &mdash; and the public and Members have  readily availed themselves of that process. I do not see how much more  transparent the Planning Service can be.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is interesting that the Member should mention  racehorses, because I placed a notional bet with myself this morning that  questions from Daith&iacute; McKay &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It was a notional bet &mdash; one is allowed to place notional  bets. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">A Member: You were minded to place a bet.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mrs Foster: Obviously some Members have not yet woken up and did not hear what I said this  morning. One can take a horse to water, but one cannot make it drink.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Some Members: Hear, hear.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Storey: What about mules?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mrs Foster: I have no clue whether one can take a mule  to water &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">A Member: What about an ass?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mrs Foster: I will not go there. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Speaker: Order, Members. Order.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mrs Foster: The Deputy Chairperson of the Committee  knows fine well that this application was made on planning grounds, and on  planning grounds alone. He will have his chance in Committee, if he so wishes,  to look at the file. The Member may wish me to appear before the Committee, and  he knows only too well that any time the  Committee asks me to appear before it, I am there.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Some Members: Hear, hear.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Storey: Like  other Members, I thank the Minister for  her statement. I assure her that, unlike another Minister in the Executive,  she will not be abandoned after she has made a decision and left to flounder on  her own. She will not be left on her own at the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway, for she will have the support of her colleagues,  and we will not behave like the disgraceful  party sitting opposite us has behaved.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Some Members: Hear, hear.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Storey: I also thank the Minister &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Speaker: Can the  Member come to his question?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Storey: I must also point out that this morning&rsquo;s  statement was made by a DUP Minister and that it was not made at the behest of  a Sinn Fe&iacute;n Member, as was suggested earlier.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In light of the Minister&rsquo;s remarks about stake&shy;holders and  others who have been involved in the process to date, can she tell us what discussions  there have been with the National Trust and Moyle District Council on any other  proposals for the Causeway area?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mrs Foster: As I understand it, there have been some  discussions with planning officials. I have not had any direct discussions with  either the National Trust or Moyle District Council. My officials had some  preliminary discussions about the alternative proposal before Christmas, and  they still await further contact from the National Trust in taking this issue  forward.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, the Member will know that those discussions are  completely separate from what has been discussed today, and he will appreciate  why I say that. The private-sector application that I decided on today stood  alone on its own merits. As I say, my decision today has nothing to do with any  other applications that may be forthcoming &mdash; and I hope that other applications  will be forthcoming.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr T Clarke: In her statement, the Minister said that  she asked her officials to initiate a process of engagement between the major  stakeholders, with a view to arriving at an agreed solution that would allow  her to approve an application. Given that only one application was made, why  did it not succeed?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mrs Foster: The Member is aware that I believed that  the application before me had considerable merit, and I have set out those  reasons in my statement today. However, on 10 September 2007, I said that there  were some difficulties, and I described them in more detail when I appeared  before the Committee for the Environment on 20 September 2007.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Those difficulties related to world heritage site status,  the requirement to minimise development in a sensitive landscape, and the  provision of a new visitors&rsquo; centre. Given that a visitors&rsquo; centre already  exists, the question of whether a new one was needed was at the forefront of my  mind at the time. Any new application to build a visitors&rsquo; centre at the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway must address those issues as well as any  others that it may encounter.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr K Robinson: I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s state&shy;ment, and I note the refusal contained therein.  However, the Northern    Ireland public must be wondering what is  next for its only world heritage site. Does the Minister agree that the entire  saga is another sorry reflection of the state of the Planning Service? To help  Members to gain a greater understanding of what has happened, will the Minister  share the nature of her discussions with the Minister for Culture, Creative  Industries and Tourism, Margaret Hodge, on the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway, which took  place in Downing Street in mid-December?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mrs Foster: Yes, I am happy to make the detail of those  discussions available. As the Member correctly said, my discussions with  Margaret Hodge were principally about UNESCO issues and the world heritage site  status of the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member criticised the Planning Service, but it is only  one part of the jigsaw that is the planning system. Much more goes on outside  the Planning Service, but it is often the whipping boy for any delays for which  it may not be responsible. Delays may be due to difficulties with funding or  the applicant, ongoing consultations, environmental impact assessments, and so  forth.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Planning Service does its job as well as it can with  its resources. The Member knows that I am considering a fundamental reform of  the planning system. That is no reflection of what has gone before, but it is  time for an overhaul, and I look to the House for its support when I bring  forward reform proposals later in the year.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Some Members: Hear, hear.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Durkan: I, too, welcome the Minister&rsquo;s state&shy;ment,  which extricates her from the complete misadventure that was created when she  made her &ldquo;of a mind&rdquo; decision. Even today, the Minister referred to her  statement on 10 September 2007 as a decision, and as an &ldquo;of a mind&rdquo; decision.  However, in the same statement she says that she had not made a decision &mdash; and she wonders why there is concern and  confusion.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister referred to the fact that &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText"><span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Speaker: Order.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Durkan: The Minister referred to the fact that no  other planning application was made. Will she confirm that that was not because  of any failure or decision of the National Trust or Moyle District Council, which was what the Committee for Enterprise, Trade  and Investment was told? Rather, it was because the Department of Enterprise,  Trade and Investment&rsquo;s position was that only an application for full planning  permission could be made, and that there was also a precondition relating to  car parking at the site.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Does the Minister accept that her decision had implications  for the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment&rsquo;s signature tourism  project &mdash; given that the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment  previously made a statement within 51 minutes of the Environment Minister&rsquo;s? We  are, therefore, due to hear a statement from him very soon. It damaged the  working partnership that had existed between the Departments on that proposal.  Given that the issue is a matter of controversy, as the Minister admits, and  affects more than one Department, will she tell the House whether she discussed  it with her Executive colleagues? I know that the party opposite are precious  about adherence to the ministerial code.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mrs Foster: I found it difficult to hear the last part  of the Member&rsquo;s contribution, but I think that he asked whether I have  discussed the issue with Executive colleagues. I made them aware that I would  be making a statement this morning.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">This is a planning issue &mdash; a planning issue alone. I am not  going to ask my colleagues to get involved in issues that do not affect their  Departments. This is not a cross-cutting issue. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">11.15 am</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mrs Foster: I made what?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Durkan: You made a political &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Speaker: Order. The Minister has the Floor.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mrs Foster: May I also say &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Speaker: Order.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mrs Foster: One Member is asking me whether I will  co-operate with the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment and the  Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment to help to promote tourism and  to propose planning policy statements on tourism, yet the Chairperson of that  Committee is telling me that I should not be speaking to the Minister of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment. That is a rather strange way for joined-up  Government to work. However, it is not strange for the SDLP, given what it has  been doing over the past two days.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Some Members: Hear, hear.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr P Robinson: They  are not even a joined-up party.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Speaker: Order.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mrs Foster: Mr Durkan made comments regarding the  application that never was and that never formally made it in to the Planning  Service. There were discussions with Planning Service officials, but it never  became a formal application.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is now eight years since the fire at the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway, and we are no further on. I hope that,  as Chairperson of the Committee for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment, Mr Durkan will force the issue on. That is the issue that  he should be considering, instead of interfering in the Department of the  Environment.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Some Members: Hear, hear.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Neeson: As the Minister is probably aware, in the  summer of 2002, in my then role as Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and  Investment, I chaired an extensive series of meetings between the National  Trust and Seymour Sweeney. It is outrageous that, in January 2008, the issue  still has not been resolved.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am pleased that Minister Dodds is present in the Chamber.  I consider him as much a part of this sorry mess as anyone else.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Speaker: Will the Member come to his question?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Neeson: Will the Minister assure me and the House  that when a new application is submitted &mdash; and one will be submitted sooner  rather than later &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Speaker: Order. The Member has the Floor.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Neeson: Will she sit down with Minister Dodds to  ensure that this issue is resolved as soon as possible?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mrs Foster: Any application will obviously have tourism  implications. I am happy to speak to the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment about that.  Those are the issues that I spoke to him about before, and those are the issues  that I will continue to speak to him about.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Kennedy: It appears that the DUP has left Mr Sweeney  on his tod. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Thank you. I have been saving that one up. Can I ask &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Speaker: Order. The Member has the Floor.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Kennedy: I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement. Will  the Minister outline the precise grounds for the refusal of the planning  application that will be listed when it is referred back &mdash; presumably to Moyle  District Council? Will she also confirm that the applicant will have the right  of appeal?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mrs Foster: The applicant will have the right of  appeal. Any such appeal would be dealt with by the Planning Appeals Commission.  I have approved a draft notice of opinion, which includes six grounds of  refusal. I am happy to let the Member have a copy of that. It would not be  constructive for me simply to read through  the six grounds, which are related to UNESCO, integration and the other  issues that I mentioned in my statement.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Dallat: Given the underground features of the  outline planning application, does the Minister agree that it will be yet  another bunker in north Antrim? In future,  will she ensure that there is the fullest consultation &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Speaker: Order.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Dallat: Will she ensure that there is the fullest  consultation before she is of an opinion to approve any future application?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mrs Foster: I did not catch the last part of what was  asked.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Dallat: Perhaps if Dr McCrea would give me an  opportunity to put my question, the Minister would be able to hear it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister agree that, given that there were  underground features in the planning application for the Giant&rsquo;s   Causeway that she proposes to refuse, it would have turned out to  be yet another bunker in north Antrim? <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Speaker: Order. I have given Members some latitude.  I have asked the Member to put his question to the Minister, and I will now ask  him to repeat it.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Dallat: Will the Minister accept that because of the  international aspect of the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway,  she will undertake the fullest consultation before she is &ldquo;of a mind&rdquo; to  approve any planning application there?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mrs Foster: I do not know whether the Member was  present when we talked about the bunker last Monday, but I said then that it  did not have planning permission either, so I will not go there.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am very much aware of the international aspect of the  Giant&rsquo;s Causeway, and I took the opportunity to go to the south coast to see  how another of the United    Kingdom&rsquo;s natural world heritage sites is  being dealt with. There is a panoply of ways being adopted, such as community,  private, and publicly owned visitors&rsquo; centres.  The Member knows that I met Margaret Hodge, and I took on board what was  said in the management plan that was approved by UNESCO in 2005.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We are rightly very proud of our world heritage site status  at the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway, and, obviously, that  consideration was one many that were at the forefront of my mind when I took  that decision.</p>
	      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="2"></a>Executive Committee Business</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Education and Skills Bill: <br>
	        Legislative Consent Motion</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">The Minister for Employment and Learning (Sir Reg  Empey): I beg to move:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;That this Assembly endorses the principle of the  extension to Northern Ireland of provisions of the Education and Skills Bill  dealing with the functions of the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority,  which are contained in clauses 137 and 139 of that Bill as introduced in the  House of Commons&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The provisions in the Education and Skills Bill that relate  to Northern Ireland  concern changes to the remit of the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority  (QCA). Clause 137 of the Bill amends section  24 of the Education Act 1997 in order to provide the Qualifications and  Curriculum Authority with a new function to develop and publish criteria for  the recognition of bodies wishing to award or authenticate qualifications.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 139 extends the powers of the Qualifications and  Curriculum Authority in Northern    Ireland to cover the regulation of  vocational qualifications currently excluded from its scope. In Northern Ireland,  most qualifications are regulated by the Council for the Curriculum,  Examinations and Assessment (CCEA). Those are general and vocational  qualifications and are provided for school pupils or persons in full-time  attendance at an institution of further education. The only exception is  national vocational qualifications (NVQs), which are regulated by the  Qualification and Curriculum Authority.  Clause 139 adds other vocational qualifications to the regulatory remit  of the authority.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Under the review of public administration, and as part of  the streamlining of education administration in Northern Ireland, CCEA should be  abolished and its functions transferred to the new education and skills authority. The proposed date for the transfer of  functions is April 2009, and although most of the functions will  transfer to the education and skills authority, it would not be appropriate to  transfer CCEA&rsquo;s regulatory function for vocationally related qualifications  (VRQs)to the education and skills authority. As that regulatory function will  not be transferred, it is imperative that steps are taken to ensure that  continued regulation of vocationally related qualifications is maintained when CCEA is subsumed by the education and skills  authority.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As the issue falls  within the area of transferred matters under the provision of the  Northern Ireland Act 1998, consent for the proposed Northern Ireland inclusions in the Bill must be sought from the Committee for  Employ&shy;ment and Learning, the Executive and the Northern Ireland  Assembly.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee for Employment and Learning and the Executive  have considered the matter, and both have given their consent to proceed with  the proposed amendments to the Education and Skills Bill.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly must now consider the principle of amending  the Bill in order to extend the regulatory functions of the Qualifications and  Curriculum Authority in Northern    Ireland. The proposed change to the  legislation would close the regulation gap that would be left once CCEA had  been dissolved and would ensure the continued and necessary regulation of  vocationally related qualifications in Northern Ireland. The change would  also guarantee that those students who are studying for vocationally related  qualifications when the council ceases to exist can be confident that  regulation will continue.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that Members will agree with me and support the  motion, which has been designed to ensure that there will be no period during  which students can doubt the currency of the qualifications that they attain. I request that the Assembly endorses the  principle of extending to Northern Ireland the provisions in  the Education and Skills Bill that deal with the functions of the  Qualifications and Curriculum Authority. Those provisions are contained in  clauses 137 and 139 of the Bill, which was introduced in the House of Commons  on 29 November 2007.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">The Chairperson of the Committee for Employ&shy;ment and  Learning (Ms S Ramsey): Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. On behalf of  the Committee for Employment and Learning, I support the motion. The Minister  has already explained the need for and purpose behind the legislative consent  motion, so I will not repeat what he said. However, I will make a couple of  points on behalf of the Committee.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Minister for the extensive consultation that he  undertook with the Committee. I am conscious that  he did not wish to bring the matter to the Assembly without the  Committee&rsquo;s support. The Committee was fully briefed on the matter on 26  September 2007 and on 9 January, which was its first meeting after the  Christmas recess. Those briefings were important for members because, first,  for the first time, they were asked to deal with the concept of a legislative  consent motion, and secondly, the matter in question is complex in its own  right.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee&rsquo;s primary concern is that people who are  studying for vocational qualifications that are regulated by the Council for the Curriculum Examinations and  Assessment are in no way disadvantaged by any reform of that regulatory body,  should that occur as planned in April 2009. There is, therefore, a need to  ensure that cover is in place to protect those important qualifications.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee was satisfied that the Qualifications and  Curriculum Authority is an appropriate body to provide regulation, if required.  It was also satisfied that QCA&rsquo;s current role in the regulation of  qualifications places it in an ideal position to extend those regulations. That  experience is strengthened by the fact that QCA maintains a local office, which  it has been operating successfully for 10 years.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although I support the motion, I have written to the Minister for Employment and Learning and the  Minister of Education to ask that they keep the situation under review  during what will be a period of difficult administrative reform. During the  departmental briefings, officials stated that the Minister had been assessing  the most appropriate regulation process for our local needs. I have written to  the Ministers to urge them to continue to work together and to keep the process  under review as the review of public administration rolls out.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee considers that any regulation of critical  vocational qualifications should be sensitive and aligned to local requirements  and circumstances. In further ensuring that  local needs are fully recognised, the Minister has also assured me that  the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families in England cannot  enact any part of the legislation that relates to, or has an impact on, local  issues without first seeking the approval of the local Minister. Go raibh maith  agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Ms Lo: I support the motion. It makes sense to extend  the remit of QCA to cover VRQs as well as NVQs.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Does the Minister envisage there being any scope for the  QCA to examine ways of combining the NVQ and VRQ as one qualification? Students  are often confused about the differences between them.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">11.30 am</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Sir Reg Empey: There is confusion, as Anna Lo said. A  review of qualifications is under way. It is a terribly complicated system.  Members will have heard the debate yesterday on other matters, which we will  not go into today. However, I assure the Member that the Department is  examining the matter closely. We do not want people to spend time and energy to  get certificates that have no currency with employers. If people work for a  qualification, they must be assured that employers around the country will  recognise it as a thing of substance, that the qualification means something  and that it has a quality-assured standard.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is a temptation for further education colleges,  employers or others to create their own qualifications, and that is a risk.  That may not be wrong in itself, but I am concerned about people working, and  spending their time and energy, to gain certificates that have no value. That  is no use to them or to us, and it is a waste of the student&rsquo;s time. Therefore,  I assure the Member that the matter is important to the Department, and we will  not embark on anything that will reduce standards. That is why we do not want  to leave a vacuum when the CCEA is absorbed into the education and skills  authority.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I assure the Chairman of the Employment and Learning  Committee, as I have already assured the Minister of Education, that we are not  doing anything today that will in any way inhibit the Assembly from passing  further legislation in the future, should it decide to do so. The Assembly is  free to create new regulations and arrangements. This legislation will merely  prevent a vacuum from developing when the CCEA is absorbed into the education  and skills authority. As I told the Committee for Education, the Assembly can  take whatever action it wishes and will not be inhibited in any way by this  Bill.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly endorses the principle of the extension to  Northern Ireland  of provisions of the Education and Skills Bill dealing with the functions of  the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority, which are contained in clauses 137  and 139 of that Bill as introduced in the House of Commons.</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading">&nbsp;</p>
	      <p class="H5StageHeading"><a name="3"></a>Budget</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Speaker: The Business Committee has agreed to allow  up to six hours for this debate. The proposer will have up to 90 minutes in  which to propose the motion and make a winding-up speech. All other Members who  wish to speak will have 10 minutes.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Two amendments have been selected and published on the Marshalled List. The proposer of each  amendment will have 10 minutes to propose and five minutes to wind up.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">The Minister of Finance and Personnel (Mr P Robinson):  I beg to move</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly approves the programme of expenditure  proposals for 2008-09 to 2010-11 as set out in the Budget laid before the  Assembly on 22 January 2008.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Last Tuesday, I presented the Executive&rsquo;s revised Budget  proposals for the three years to March 2011, following  a period of consultation on the draft proposals, which were originally  published in October 2007. Today, I seek the Assembly&rsquo;s approval for those  plans, which were unanimously agreed by the Executive. When I launched the  revised Budget last week, I provided comprehensive details of the consultation  process and the Executive&rsquo;s response to it. I do not wish to take up an undue  amount of the limited time available today by going over all of those issues or  going through the Departments&rsquo; allocations again.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, I will  emphasise a few key points regarding the Executive&rsquo;s proposals for  Members to consider as we commence the debate and before we vote on the motion.  I will also announce how the Executive plan to create and maintain a strong focus on monitoring delivery of their commitments as they use the financial  allocations proposed in the Budget.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I turn first to the consultation exercise conducted on the  draft Budget proposals published last October. In my statement last Tuesday, I acknowledged the key role played by  the statutory Committees of the Assembly in reviewing and reporting on the  departmental and cross-cutting implications  of the draft Budget proposals. I  believe that the Committees must also have an ongoing key role in  monitoring and reporting on the delivery of the objectives and targets for  which Departments will be responsible and accountable over the next three  years, and beyond, as they use the resources proposed for them in the Budget. I  will say more on that later.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In addition to consideration of the draft Budget in the  Assembly, there was also a public consultation exercise. Over 9,500 written  submissions were made during the 10-week consultation period. That number vastly exceeds the level of engagement on any  previous Budget consultation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Let no one say that the Executive have not taken seriously  the views of the Assembly or the wider community. We have listened to what has  been said, and we have responded to it, with additional funding for the arts,  children and youth services, mental health and social housing &mdash; all of which  were key issues of concern during the  consultation process. Those additional allocations build on the position  set out in the draft Budget, which included: a freeze on domestic regional  rates in cash terms, meaning a real-terms reduction for households;  non-domestic rates frozen in real terms; clear  prioritisation of economic growth, with associated benefits for all in the community; the  largest-ever budget allocation for the Health Service; and the  largest-ever programme of investment in  public-service infrastructure. The  proposals allow for increased support for businesses and funding for  schools, as well as improved access to hospital services and additional  resources for key public-health matters, such as suicide prevention. In addition, there is funding to enhance the rural  economy. The Office of the First  Minister and deputy First Minister will receive extra funding to deliver  a comprehensive approach to victims, as well as resources to embed the rights  of older people.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As I have indicated, the final Budget proposals were agreed  unanimously by the Executive, providing a clear  recognition by all parties that the approach adopted represents the best  overall package of measures &mdash; within our affordability limits &mdash; for all the  people of Northern Ireland.  There will always be scope to develop further the Budget allocations, and we  will revise our spending plans if that becomes necessary.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, I have been more than saddened, though not unduly  surprised, by the approach taken by some who appear to be disappointed that  issues raised by Ministers have been resolved. Unfortunately, that has been  reflected in the Chamber and outside, where criticisms have been put forward by  some who appear to be more interested in opposition for its own sake, to boost their presence in the media, than offering  realistic alternatives to improve  the Programme for Government or the Executive&rsquo;s spending plans.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Worse, there are those who place a greater priority on  engaging in party-political positioning than on addressing the needs of the  people of Northern Ireland.  The finalisation of a Budget by the Executive is about making difficult  choices. The choices made are in the best interests of Northern Ireland,  but, of course, in a democracy, others will differ, and it is right that they  should be allowed to say so.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">For the Alliance Party and the SDLP, the choices are very  different. The Alliance Party is not an Executive party, so it is proper that  it should take every platform that our democracy provides to state its case and  to challenge ours. I would not inhibit that right. However, the SDLP is in an entirely  different position. It is an Executive party. It is in the Executive; it is  responsible for making its case in the Executive and contributing to the  formulation of the Programme for Government, the investment strategy, and the  Budget.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If the SDLP wanted changes made to any of those documents,  it should have put forward amendments in the Executive.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I regard it as a considerable achievement for the Executive  that we managed to reach unanimous agreement  around the table, with Ministers from all four Executive parties signing  up to the Programme for Government, the  investment strategy for Northern    Ireland and the Budget. It is a sign  of the political maturity of the Administration, and the parties involved in  it, that we managed to balance Departments&rsquo; various needs in a way that  satisfied everyone. Although no Department achieved all that it would have  liked, everyone was prepared to sign up to the sum of the agreed parts.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Let me make it clear: Ministers did not merely agree to  their portion of the family of key documents &mdash; they agreed to them all as a  whole. The Programme for Government and the investment strategy for Northern Ireland  are not the property of the First Minister and the deputy First Minister; the  Budget is not just mine. All three documents  are owned by the Executive. I hope that the Assembly will also identify  itself with them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In order to reach  agreement on the Budget, many hours of discussion and negotiation took  place with Ministers and officials. That was the opportunity for Ministers to  influence the process, and they did so. By the time that the Budget came to the  Executive, all Ministers were content to approve it. I must say, therefore,  that I find it bizarre that at the eleventh  hour and fifty-ninth minute, one party, whose Minister signed up to all  of those documents, now seeks to make amendments. That is cynical political  opportunism at its worst; politics that is devoid of principle. The public  will, however, see through it as a low political stunt. It is made worse by the  fact that no amendment was ever made by the Minister for Social Development in  the Executive, yet it has been bounced at all of us in the Assembly. That  approach is not designed to get the right outcome; it is merely intended to  grab a headline and position that party for the future. It is opposition for  opposition&rsquo;s sake. It is an absurd approach from a party that is in Government.  It is bereft of any principle and exposes the SDLP as a party that is more  interested in short-term political expediency than in good government.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">People will want to know whether the SDLP Minister signed  up to the Programme for Government, the investment strategy and the Budget in  the clear knowledge that her party intended all along to vote against it. Such  an approach would pose the most fundamental questions about the good faith of  the Minister for Social Development. On the other hand, has the SDLP cut the  legs from under its own Minister at the last moment? In that case, how can she  remain in office when she lacks the confidence of her own party?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">What kind of party has its Minister sign up to the  Executive&rsquo;s key policy instruments and spending plans without ever once  proposing any kind of amendment in the Executive, to then vote against the  Executive in the Assembly? The SDLP leader said that his party&rsquo;s approach was  no different from that taken by the DUP during the last Assembly. What  nonsense! During the last Assembly, the DUP&rsquo;s goal &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have the transcript if the Member wants to read it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">During the last Assembly, the DUP&rsquo;s goal was to bring down  the Executive and to create new political institutions.  Is that currently the SDLP&rsquo;s goal? Moreover, the DUP did not sit on that  Executive or endorse its Programme for Government and Budget. The SDLP has had  the opportunity to seek amendments to any of those documents at the Executive.  It was cynically determined to stay silent in the Executive and to ambush us at  the Assembly. The SDLP has embarked on a strategy that deserves nothing more or  less than the contempt of the Assembly and the disdain and derision of the  public.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that people understand that there are no  easy options and that alternative choices have clear implications. Spending  cannot be increased in one area without a commensurate reduction somewhere else  or an increase in local taxation.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">11.45 am</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I now turn to the position of the Alliance Party.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">A Member: Is it worth it?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr P Robinson: Oh yes, it is.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member for North Down Dr Farry is quite open about the  Alliance Party&rsquo;s agenda, which I have costed. I applaud him for his honesty.  Although his proposals are fiscal folly and fundamentally flawed, I pay tribute  to him for telling the people of Northern Ireland that the Alliance Party wants to impose more taxes on  them. I thank him for that insight, although his constituents, probably,  will not. Sir Humphrey would have called it &ldquo;courageous&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Last week, on the BBC programme &lsquo;Hearts and Minds&rsquo;, Dr  Farry agreed with Noel Thompson&rsquo;s description  of the freeze on regional rating as &ldquo;capitalist populism.&rdquo; Dr Farry also  called for an increase in industrial rating. To meet the cost of the additional  funding sought by the Alliance Party, it would be necessary to triple the amount of money that people are paying  in domestic rates &mdash; that would be the outcome of  the Alliance Party&rsquo;s proposals. I fundamentally disagree with that  approach. The Northern    Ireland householder deserves a break, given  that there have been regional rate increases of 60% over the past five years.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In a difficult  international environment, it is important that we give local manufacturing base whatever support that we  can &mdash; especially when one of the Executive&rsquo;s priorities is to encourage  economic growth. Rather than place a greater burden on householders, we should  accept that Government must deliver more.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We should also be careful not to exaggerate the  significance of the Deloitte report &lsquo;Research into the financial cost of the Northern Ireland  divide&rsquo;. It is not a panacea. Although it may offer some long-term  opportunities, it is not a short-term solution. It will certainly not have the impact suggested by the Alliance Party  during the course of the Budget period. The Alliance Party talks about the  matter as if there is a pot of money that we can dip into at any time. That, of  course, is not so.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As a citizen of Northern Ireland, I sincerely want  an end to the wasteful division in our society. As Minister of Finance and  Personnel, I welcome any opportunity to  reallocate resources to a more productive use. However, the reality is  not that simple. The &pound;1&middot;5 billion cost of a divided  society quoted in the Deloitte report is an upper limit &mdash; and an  unrealistic one at that, as there is an implied assumption that the higher  level of public expenditure in Northern Ireland is entirely due to division. We  all know that that is not the case.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Such an assumption is patent nonsense and ignores the  impact of factors such as demographic structure, rurality and deprivation,  which also explain why there is a greater need for expenditure in Northern Ireland than in the rest of the United Kingdom.  Nevertheless, I share the view that savings could be made from that source, and  I have asked my officials to examine the findings of the report, with a view to  identifying those elements that can be addressed in the short term.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Perhaps, rather than hissing from the sidelines, the  Alliance Party will engage with me in that exercise.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Some Members: Hiss.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr P Robinson: Yes. I said &ldquo;hissing.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I invited Alliance Party Members to meet me and discuss the  issue &mdash; I am still waiting for a response to that invitation. I encourage all  Executive Ministers to make as many savings as possible from the cost of  division, because they have made it clear to me that the efficiency savings  expected over the next three years are  equivalent to almost one tenth of current budgets and will represent a  significant challenge for them. Thus, all  scope for savings needs to be vigorously pursued.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Many Members have  commented that the Executive&rsquo;s agreement  of the Budget, the Programme for Government and the investment strategy  represents a significant achievement in itself. That is true. However, agreeing  proposed departmental budget allocations will not, by itself, deliver the  Executive&rsquo;s objectives which they have set for themselves. They have set those objectives  clearly in their Programme for Government and their investment strategy. The  mere fact of agreeing the Budget, the Programme for Government and the investment strategy will not, in itself, make the  difference. They are necessary, but not sufficient, conditions to create  the type of society and economy that we all wish to see.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">To make a real difference for all the people of Northern Ireland,  we must ensure that we deliver on the commitments that we have made, using the  resources that have been allocated in the Budget. That is the challenge that  now faces Executive Ministers, their Departments, public bodies and public  servants across the length and breadth of the country. I repeat that in three  years&rsquo; time people will not ask Ministers about the allocations that they  received; they will ask them what they delivered.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive have set targets such as: the extension of  free public transport to everyone who is aged 60 and over; improvements in  mental-health and learning-disability services; the movement of 70,000  working-age benefit clients into employment by March 2011; a 25% reduction in  the amount of red tape in the agrifood sector by 2013; the growth of the  tourism industry by over 40% by 2011; the alleviation of fuel poverty in 9,000  households each year; the completion of an additional 10,000 social and  affordable houses by 2013, representing a 60% increase on the annual figure for  2006-07; and a reduction to nine weeks of the maximum wait for treatment for  outpatients and to 17 weeks for inpatients.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The latter target  highlights the scale of the Executive&rsquo;s ambition. We have set a target  of 17 weeks as the minimum wait for inpatient treatment. That compares to the  target of 78 weeks that the previous Executive set; even that deplorably low  ambition was not achieved.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Those are just some examples of the testing targets that  the Executive have set. Our focus must now be on delivering those targets,  which must be acted on in partnership with local business, the trade unions,  and the community and voluntary sectors. Government should not, and cannot,  have sole responsibility for delivering improvements to the quality of life. As  I pointed out in my Budget statement on January 22 2008, in a global  environment, a local Administration can have only a limited impact on economic  growth, even in Northern    Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, listeners to BBC Radio&rsquo;s &lsquo;Evening Extra&rsquo; programme last Tuesday might have thought that  the impact of the Budget was being  felt far beyond Northern    Ireland. The presenter who read the  news headlines announced, in one breath, that Peter Robinson delivered his  first Budget to the Assembly and that the US Federal Reserve cut its key  interest rate by 0&middot;75%. I am concerned at what the global implications might be  when I return to the Chamber to discuss the outcome of the February monitoring  round.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The key objective in  delivering against the Executive&rsquo;s targets is to develop a culture of  robust performance management and delivery that underpins the highest standards  of financial management. With more money than ever allocated for the next three  years, we must recognise that local people demand and expect public services to  have a meaningful impact on, and bring tangible benefits to, their lives. Those  benefits will be realised only if the emphasis is on getting the most from the  money that is invested in those services. Financial management in the public  sector is about the cost-effective delivery of Government priorities, with due  regard being paid to risk and opportunity. It is also about safeguarding money that has been entrusted to us by the  taxpayer. An effective financial and governance framework that facilitates the  delivery of the plans that are set out in the Budget is an essential component  in the process.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My Department has an important role to play in and  responsibility for providing advice on &mdash; and ensuring the delivery of &mdash; improvements in the overall standard of  financial management, building on the examples of good practice that are  already in place. My officials are actively  working with Departments in helping to improve financial management and accountability. New systems and  processes, such as account Northern    Ireland, are being implemented. Along with  the Centre for Applied Learning, better  training and development opportunities are being made available to  staff. New international accounting standards and more timely production of  accounts will assist all parts of the public sector to actively improve  financial management standards.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Of course, spending the money is only one aspect of  delivery. It is equally important that the resources be used efficiently and  effectively. The public service agreements to be published shortly will set out  in detail how Departments will work together to achieve the targets and  outcomes identified in the Programme for Government. The delivery agreements  will set out roles and responsibilities, lines of accountability, performance  measurement methods and risk management strategies.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive will also put in place monitoring  arrangements at a strategic level to ensure that the key outcomes from the  Programme for Government are delivered. The model here is a risk-based approach  where the degree of scrutiny varies depending on the extent to which progress  is being made. Ministers will play a more interventionist role where the  delivery of outcomes and targets falls short of expectations. For example, if a  Department is not delivering on its key objectives and commitments with the  resources that it has been allocated by the Executive, the Executive will have to question whether those resources should  remain with that Department or be reallocated elsewhere.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Statutory Committees will have a key role to play in  monitoring the performance of their Departments in delivering on the targets  and commitments in the Programme for Government and investment strategy. That  is one of the conclusions and recommendations in the report on the draft Budget  from the Committee for Finance and Personnel. The Committee has also noted  that, as we move into a period of more constrained public expenditure growth,  there is an even greater onus on Departments to manage public finances in a way  that achieves the highest possible level of spend within authorised limits and maximises the impact from available  resources. The Committee has recommended that all Statutory Committees should  include budgetary and financial scrutiny as an integral part of their work  programmes. I strongly support that recommendation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The performance and  efficiency delivery unit will have a  vital role in supporting the Executive and Departments in achieving  improved outcomes from investment in public services. If the Executive are to  achieve the challenging objectives that we have set for ourselves, we must  create a new focus on performance, efficiency and delivery across all areas of  public-sector activity.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">One of the main responsibilities of the Department of  Finance and Personnel is to monitor how efficiently Departments spend their  money. Therefore, the new unit in my Department will identify and work with  specific areas of public-sector activity where there is scope for improved  delivery or efficiency, and will seek to secure better levels of performance.  It will also identify options for further efficiency savings in specific areas,  over and above the targets already set out for the next three years. There will  be a small number of core staff in the unit. That will provide plenty of scope  to involve others in specific pieces of work that the unit will carry out &mdash;  individuals from other Departments and public bodies, staff working in  front-line public-service delivery, audit staff and staff from private-sector  organisations can lend specific expertise and experience in particular areas.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I also wish to have access to advice on how best to achieve  significant and sustainable improvements in the performance and delivery of  large and complex organisations. Therefore, I will establish an advisory panel  consisting of individuals who have a strong track record of managing and leading successful and strategic organisational change, involving the delivery of  better-quality services and greater efficiency.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Many people will be involved in ensuring that the improved  outcomes identified in the Programme for Government and the investment strategy  are delivered for the people of Northern    Ireland. The starting point is the financial allocation made to each Department  in the Executive&rsquo;s final Budget proposals. Those allocations will  provide a solid basis on which all the Executive Ministers can now begin the  task of ensuring delivery on our commitments to everyone in our community.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Some Members: Hear, hear.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Dr Farry: I beg to move amendment No 1: Leave out all  after &ldquo;Assembly&rdquo; and insert: </p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;calls on the Minister of Finance and Personnel to lay a  revised programme of expenditure proposals for 2008-09 to 2010-11 before the  Assembly, as the Budget currently before the Assembly does not properly address  the deep divisions in this society and the need to build a shared future; does  not make meaningful changes to balance the regional economy; and fails to  provide for sustainable and integrated public services.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I oppose the Budget. However, the Alliance Party does not  oppose the Budget for the sake of it. There will be times when the Alliance  Party backs actions from the Executive. We  support elements of the Budget.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Alliance Party opposes the Budget because it is flawed,  and there is an alternative way forward. Although we congratulate the Finance  Minister on getting the Budget to the Assembly and recognise that it is a major  piece of work, the Minister must respect the Alliance Party&rsquo;s entitlement to  put forward its alternative views &mdash; but, I think, we have that respect.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">12.00 noon</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Last week, the Minister said that everyone should put their  shoulder to the wheel in this new Northern Ireland. However, some  people have doubts about the direction in which we are going.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are flaws in the substance of the Budget. First,  there is a lack of reference to a shared future, and not enough effort has been  made to address the savings that have been made from no longer tackling the  costs of a violent society. The Minister has made some rhetorical references to  that in his Budget statements, but it is not a central theme in the Budget.  Efforts to identify efficiency savings from tackling division are referred to  PEDU for longer-term consideration, but we want to make a start.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister referred to the report from Deloitte, which is  a well-established consultancy firm that is respected around the world. That  report must be given serious consideration,  and the Alliance Party is concerned that  it has been shelved by the First Minister and deputy First Minister.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Alliance Party went into the election stating that the  costs of a divided society amounted to &pound;1 billion &mdash; not &pound;1&middot;5 billion. We have  tabled a motion for future discussion, so that Members can air their views on  the contents of the Deloitte report. The report is strong in its tackling of  the direct costs and opportunity costs of a divided society, but its addressing  of the embedded costs of duplicate goods, facilities and services &mdash;  particularly in education, which I will talk about later &mdash; is weak.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is no new investment into shared services, such as  better public services for the entire community. Change will take time, but we  must make a start. The Executive&rsquo;s emphasis on economic development is welcome, but there is little appreciation that  meaningful and sustainable growth is not possible without the tackling  of divisions in society and the promotion of a shared future alongside it.  Divisions have an impact on labour mobility, and they deter inward investment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are clear international lessons that the most  successful societies in the world tend to be those that are most open to new  ideas and those that are most tolerant.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, the Budget is a recipe for a low-tax society  rather than for genuine investment in economic growth. The Finance Minister has  taken an already tight comprehensive spending review settlement from London and made it even  tighter. Contrary to the impression that was  given last week, there is not universal support for the taxation and  spending framework. The approach taken to taxation has been questioned by such  organisations as the Economic Research Institute of Northern Ireland (ERINI),  the Confederation of British Industry (CBI)  and the Northern Ireland Council for Voluntary Action (NICVA) &mdash; diverse  organisations.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A low taxation  approach, at the expense of investment in public services, is  regressive. The benefits will disproportionately benefit the more affluent  elements of society and hurt those who are less well off &mdash; particularly those  who depend on public services and, perhaps,  do not pay as high rates as others. The approach is populist and not  based on evidence. Furthermore, the claimed benefits of &pound;1,000 per household  have been questioned by Oxford Economics.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Much of the Budget depends upon the 3% efficiency savings  being achieved. The Alliance Party has no doubt that efficiency savings of 3%  are possible, and such annual savings in the private sector are routine.  However, we are concerned about the narrow ground over which those savings are  being sought. There are big questions about how public services are being  delivered, and they are not targeted in the Budget. The most obvious area in  that regard is education, particularly through the policy on sustainable schools.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are huge inefficiencies in the school estate, and, so  far, a policy for area planning and collaboration between schools has not been  produced never mind incorporated into the documents that the Assembly is  discussing this week. The wisdom of attempting a considerable amount of  capital-assets sales at a time when the property market has slowed down is not  entirely obvious either.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Much of the control of the economy lies outside the control  of the Assembly. That is reflected in the fact that many of the targets before  the House are ambitious &mdash; something we welcome &mdash; but aspirational, without  clear evidence of the means to deliver them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We also have to reflect on the British Government&rsquo;s  regional policy &mdash; if that is what it can be called &mdash; in which the interests of London and the south-east of England are prioritised at the  expense of the rest of the regions, thus leaving us in a dependency situation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is unfortunate that targets for measuring economic  conversions have been changed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Rather than comparing our performance with the UK average, we are now to be compared to the UK average minus the south-east of England.  Although I understand the desire to remove distortions that arise as a result  of real growth in the south-east, rather than simply considering the overall  balance of the national economy, we are now  reduced to a regional dependency culture and to fighting over the scraps  from the table.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Having said that, there are other factors that are in our  control, and the investment in the four identified economic drivers is welcome.  However, an obvious point that has been made by the Confederation of British  Industry and others is that, rather than adopting populist taxation measures,  more resources could have been poured into those drivers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, rather than  truly embracing globalisation, we are still focused on an old-fashioned  approach to economic support. For example, money is to be poured into  modernising agriculture &mdash; and I will probably lose the Chairperson of the  Committee for Agriculture and Rural  Development on this point. However, agri&shy;culture is a shrinking element  of the overall economy. From such  investment, other sectors could have benefited more and achieved a greater leap forward in productivity.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Much of our inward-investment strategy still depends on the  grant-making approach of selective-financial assistance. A properly informed  debate &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr S Wilson: Will the Member give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Dr Farry: I am sorry, but I have a lot to get through.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There must be a properly informed debate on the relative  merits of investing in selective financial assistance compared with greater  investments in the economic drivers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The one fiscal tool  that the Minister has at his disposal &mdash; industrial derating &mdash; is,  effectively, anachronistic, and was first introduced in Northern Ireland  in 1929 &mdash; the year of the great depression. By contrast, England banned  industrial derating as far back as the 1960s.  The Minister has ignored the Economic Research Institute of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s evidence-based approach, which  states that, rather than keeping industrial derating at 30%, it would be safe  to increase it to 50% and, as a consequence, raise some lost revenue. Hence,  rather than being governed by evidence, our overall approach has been governed  more by populism.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is not necessary to match funding allocations in the  rest of the United Kingdom.  Devolution is about setting different priorities. However, we should make  informed choices, and the Alliance Party has already highlighted the imbalance  between roads and public-transport expenditure. The arts sector, which was the  most vocal sector during the consultation period, has received an additional &pound;2  million per annum, and that is useful. However, clearly, that does not bring  arts funding into line with at least the UK average. Given that Northern Ireland  is comparatively advantaged by its artistic talents, that should be an area in  which we should invest.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Speaker: Order. The Member has the Floor.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Dr Farry: Finally, I will concentrate on health. The  Minister has acted like the grand old Duke of York &mdash; marching us to the top of  the hill and back down again &mdash; in his campaign for proper National Health  Service funding in Northern    Ireland. For the sake of a facade of unity  in the Executive, he seems to have settled for much less than what is required  to maintain a level of healthcare that is on a par with the rest of the United Kingdom.  In order to keep pace with funding in the rest of the UK, Northern Ireland  requires a health budget of at least &pound;4&middot;4 billion, and, to maintain the same  level of service, the revised Budget leaves a health funding shortfall of &pound;200  million. The DUP can talk all it wants about record Health Service funding, but  the simple fact is that we are not keeping pace with the rest of the UK.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the revised Budget, there is little genuine new money  for health. The efficiency savings are simply reprocessed existing money, and  the moneys that come from monetary rounds will have no effect on the underlying  baselines. The &pound;10 million per annum for mental health is the only genuinely  new money, and that is barely sufficient to address the serious under&shy;funding  in that critical area of healthcare. We spend a measly 8% of the health budget  on mental health, compared to the UK average of 12%.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">All around the world, health costs are rising &mdash; people are  living longer and the price of drugs and new technologies are rising. Sadly,  compared with the rest of the United Kingdom,  Northern Ireland  continues to have a much higher per capita needs base. It would be good if the  Executive were to suggest that we tackle and reduce that needs gap, but that is  not the case.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Clearly, efficiency savings in the Health Service are  necessary.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Speaker: Order.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Dr Farry: However, they must not come as a result of  cost cutting and denying funds. Such savings are necessary in order that money  can be reinvested into new services. Rather than addressing the population&rsquo;s  evolving needs, the new money &mdash; insofar as we have any &mdash; is barely enough to  keep up with inescapable pressures.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Speaker: Your time is up.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr O&rsquo;Loan: I beg to move amendment No 2: Leave out all  after &ldquo;Assembly&rdquo; and insert:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;calls on the Minister of Finance and Personnel to lay  before the Assembly a revised programme of  expenditure proposals for 2008-09 to  2010-11, as the Budget proposals currently before the Assembly do not  provide clear budgetary lines for key policy developments, including the  anti-poverty strategy; fail to set out funding commit&shy;ments in respect of  proposed reforms in post-primary education; abandon cross-cutting funds,  including a fund for children and young people; and are unclear in their  implications for householders in terms of future charging for water.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Mussolini made the trains in Italy run on  time, and the responsibility of the Finance Minister &mdash; through the Budget &mdash; is  to have the same effect on the literal and metaphorical trains in our society.  As Members know, the literal trains in our society often do not run on time &mdash;  sometimes not at all. There are many trains in our society that do not provide  the service that they should. The SDLP&rsquo;s approach to the Budget is influenced  by its principles; the SDLP is a social democratic party and is committed to an  inclusive society that tackles disadvantage &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Speaker: Order.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr O&rsquo;Loan: A society that provides equality, is  socially just, and sustains the environment. The SDLP believes in a balance of economic and social investment &mdash; we are  committed to economic development but regard economic and social development as  inter&shy;dependent. That is not adequately reflected in the programme or the  Budget, which are too short term. Social spending now will produce economic  benefit in the future.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Budget cannot be considered without looking at the  overall context: Northern    Ireland is in long-term relative economic  decline, which &mdash; one could argue &mdash; began at the time of partition. However,  that is a debate for another day. Our infrastructure is obsolete, and we have a  deeply divided society that was created, and  exacerbated, by more than 30 years of conflict. Some Members have a lot  to answer for in relation to that conflict. Therefore, the Budget has a major  job to do.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is, of course, some substance and value in the  Budget, as we stated in the debate on the Programme for Government yesterday.  However, we have concerns about the Budget. One concern is about our divided  society; I am holding a Northern Ireland Community Relations Council journal,  which has a picture of a beautiful park in Belfast with trees, grass, paths and  everything else that one would expect. However, running through that park is a  corrugated iron fence between eight and 10 feet high, which separates the  Catholic side from the Protestant side. Sometimes a picture says more than a  thousand words.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Some Members: That is a shame.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr O&rsquo;Loan: It is a shame, but there is nothing in the  Programme for Government or Budget that directly addresses that issue. There is  a danger in creating, or attempting to create, a separate but equal society.  That would be doomed to failure but might suit the two largest parties in the  Assembly. The Alliance Party must not claim sole ownership of the issue,  because it is built into the founding principles of the SDLP. The Alliance  Party should not claim to be the sole party of opposition. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Speaker: Order.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr O&rsquo;Loan: We claim our ministerial position as a  right, but also assert our right to oppose what we think needs opposition in  any area of Executive policy. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Speaker: Order, the Member has the Floor.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr O&rsquo;Loan: It is clear that our tactics and strategy  have caused discomfort for some Members. Our party is totally united on its  tactics and strategy. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Ford: I am pleased to hear Mr O&rsquo;Loan talk about the  necessity of building a shared future, which the north Belfast park he mentioned clearly  demonstrates. Why does the SDLP amendment not mention a shared future?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr O&rsquo;Loan: We made our stance clear in the debate on,  and our proposed amendment to, the Programme for Government &mdash; the two are  closely linked. </p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Our Government is not joined up enough; a perennial problem  in government is trying to get Departments working together. Important issues  requiring two or more Departments to work together often fall by the wayside  because neither Department takes the lead. One clear example of that can be  seen in the children&rsquo;s fund. There must be more strategic focus on that key  issue, which is a vital one if we are to tackle child poverty. Children in poverty are handicapped in life&rsquo;s race, and they  inevitably fall behind. Creating a separate fund for children would give  the issue more focus and would provide the option for bids to be made for more  funds in-year. The SDLP believes that that is the better way forward.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members have been told that the reform of secondary schools  will be the biggest change in sixty years, yet, remarkably, it is not referred  to in the Programme for Government and it is therefore not budgeted for. The  reform has been referred to as being cost neutral. However, the Minister of  Finance and Personnel has indicated that he would be uncomfor&shy;table about such  an assertion. The SDLP sees that as a major weakness in the Budget.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is also lack of clarity in the Budget. The public  service agreements have no clear budget lines attached to them, therefore one  cannot know how much will be spent on each one. There is also the uncertainty  about water charging. The Executive have taken no decisions on how water will  be paid for. The strand-two report has just been published, and all proposals will, in due course, be issued for  consultation. SDLP Members will not be hung out to dry on water  proposals that we have not seen and approved.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are other areas in which the SDLP feels that the  Budget&rsquo;s success is being predicated on uncertain propositions. For example,  are the efficiency savings going to be real?  The Minister of Finance and Personnel knows the answer to that &mdash; or if  he does not know, I am sure that he will soon receive a piece of paper from his  officials telling him that close to one half of the efficiency savings posited  for his own Department come from a mere accountancy adjustment whereby an  already-received receipt is transferred from one column to another. There is an  element of smoke and mirrors about the Budget.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We can be sure that accounting officers throughout the public service, taking their lead from the  Department of Finance and Personnel, will be exerting themselves to find  manoeuvres in which efficiency savings such as these can be found. However, in  some places real changes will be made in  order to meet efficiency demands, and those may damage front-line  services, particularly in Departments and agencies, such as the Department of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety and the Social Security Agency, in  which such services form their core business.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The area of asset sales  is very problematic. Workplace 2010 is designed to deliver an upfront  payment in the order of &pound;170 million. That sum, given the present state of the  property market becomes very questionable. The general issue, having identified  assets for sale, is when to sell those assets and how much might be realised  from selling them &mdash; that is a very problematic area.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP recognises the gain of &pound;205 million for social  housing that has been made between the draft Budget and the final Budget. I  commend the Minister for Social Development, Margaret Ritchie for the effort  that she had to make to obtain that money. It was money that should have been  in the draft Budget in the first place. However, she has also made it clear  that the revised figure will still not be enough for her to meet the  Executive&rsquo;s targets.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In his statement, the Minister of Finance and Personnel  referred to &pound;1,000 in savings per household. I say to people: do not book your  holidays on the strength of that. I would not even book a weekend in  Castlereagh. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Speaker: Order. The Member has the Floor.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr O&rsquo;Loan: People should not suppose that it will be an  annual saving. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Speaker: Order.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr O&rsquo;Loan: The sum is not even being calculated over the three years covered by the Budget. If  the figure is to be meaningful then it is to be calculated over a  four-year period, which was what the Minister said in his statement on the draft Budget. The fact is that people will never see that money in their hands. If  water charging is introduced, either through rates bills or household  bills, people will not see any reductions or money being returned when those  bills land on their mats.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Speaker: The Member&rsquo;s time is almost up.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr O&rsquo;Loan: They will see instead an increase of the  order of 25%.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that the Minister, when he sums up, will confirm &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Speaker: The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr O&rsquo;Loan: &mdash; that there is funding for the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway visitors&rsquo; centre in his Budget  proposals.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As a party, we have presented sound reasons for our  amendment.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Speaker: I ask the Member to take his seat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">The Chairperson of the Committee for Finance and  Personnel (Mr McLaughlin): Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I take this  opportunity to commend the Minister and his  officials for accomplishing the very  challenging task of co-ordinating and compiling the Budget on behalf of  the Assembly.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Budget that we are debating today aims to support and  deliver the strategic priorities set out in the Programme for Government,  including: growing our economy; investing in infrastructure; modernising public  services; environmental protection; and promoting tolerance, inclusion, health  and well-being.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Minister also for his acknowledgement of the  role that the Committee for Finance and Personnel and the other Assembly  Committees played in the process. That culminated in the Committee publishing a  co-ordinated report on the draft Budget on 8 January 2008 on behalf of all the  Assembly departmental scrutiny Committees. The report set out 21 overarching  conclusions and recommendations that aim to influence the Executive in its  future work.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to the Executive&rsquo;s strategic priorities, the  Committee recognises the pressing need to raise productivity and living  standards in the North and therefore welcomes the increased focus on economic  growth. The Committee considers that the new emphasis on the economy  necessitates the early publication of a new and revised regional economic  strategy that sets out how the Executive&rsquo;s high-level goals will be realised.  That should include a cross-cutting implementation plan for the four  productivity drivers &mdash; skills, enterprise, innovation and infra&shy;structure. I  believe that a new regional economic strategy takes on even greater  significance and urgency in the context of the very disappointing Varney report  and the global economic challenges ahead.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee is also mindful of the importance of the Executive&rsquo;s other priorities regarding  infrastructure, health, equality, public services and the environment.  We all recognise that there are only finite resources available to meet many of  the demands in terms of maintaining and improving public services. The focus is  therefore on ensuring that the resources available to the Executive are  deployed strategically and fairly, with the emphasis being on activities and  programmes that support the delivery of key priorities.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In its report on the draft Budget, my Committee  acknowledged the constraints within which the Executive have to operate. The  outcome of the comprehensive spending review means that real-terms growth in  public expenditure here over the next three years will average only 1&middot;2% a  year. The Committee also recognises that the Executive have had to address a  range of legacy issues inherited from the direct rule period, including water  and domestic rating reform, which were the cause of mounting public concern.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n: The Durkan tax.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr McLaughlin: My colleague reminds us of the legacy of  the disastrous deal that Mark Durkan and David Trimble struck with the British  Treasury.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As a consequence, the revised Budget places a strong  emphasis on efficiency and value for money. The Committee responded to that  positively in its report by examining a range of strategic and cross-cutting  budgetary issues with a view to identifying ways of maximising the impact from  limited resources. In particular, it recommended a range of specific measures  aimed at supporting the efficiency drive, eradicating the culture of underspend  and raising the performance of Departments in managing public money for the  delivery of front-line services.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr O&rsquo;Loan: On a point of order, Mr Speaker. I  understand that when you called Mr McLaughlin to speak it was as the  Chairperson of the Committee for Finance and Personnel. He has expressed  political views, making reference to Mark Durkan, that are certainly not the  determined views of the Committee. They are clearly party-political views. Mr  Speaker, I ask for a ruling on that matter.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">The Speaker: Order. Mr McLaughlin had already indicated  that he would make remarks as Chairperson of the Committee and as a Member of  this Assembly.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Storey: Point of order, Mr Speaker.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">The Speaker: Order. We saw an example this morning of a  Chairperson of a Committee who dwelt on political issues.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Order, Members. Order. I normally give the Chair&shy;persons of  Committees some latitude. Unfortunately, some exceed their position. However,  Mr McLaughlin came to the Table and indicated clearly that he wished to speak  as Chairperson of the Committee, but that he would make some personal remarks.  That was absolutely clear.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Storey: On a point of order, Mr Speaker, if the  honourable Member asks for a point of order &mdash; although that is consistent with  SDLP inconsistency &mdash; will you also make a ruling on the issues to which you  referred, regarding Patsy McGlone&rsquo;s disgraceful comments when he spoke as  Chairperson of his Committee? Those were political comments; therefore, the  SDLP cannot pick and choose.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Speaker: I will take no further points of order on  the issues. We shall move on.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr McLaughlin: Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle.  Even as Chairperson, I believe I have the right to speak on matters of record,  and this matter has, on many occasions, been  addressed, not only by members of my Committee, but by Members of this  Assembly.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Durkan: Mr Speaker, the Member &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Speaker: I said that I would take no further points  of order on this particular issue. I ask the Member to continue.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr McLaughlin: The Committee considered a range of key  financial management issues, including the planned reduction in overcommitment;  the new requirement of the Executive to negotiate with the Treasury each year  for access to end-of-year flexibility; and the level of annual underspend by  Departments, which is unacceptably high in comparison with other regions.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee concluded  that those issues combined to place a heavy onus on Departments to  manage public finances in a way that achieves the highest possible level of  spend within authorised limits, and maximises the impact from available  resources.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A further cross-cutting theme in the Budget is the reform  agenda, in which the Department of Finance and Personnel will have a key role.  The Civil Service reform programmes are expected to realise a range of benefits  and value-for-money savings across the 11 Departments. Those benefits will be  measured by a series of key performance indicators that will be integrated into  departmental business planning. Again, the Committee will continue to review and monitor the work of the Department  against targets set for each of the relevant programmes.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have addressed only some of the issued covered in the  Committee&rsquo;s co-ordinated approach, particularly the importance of the financial  management agenda, together with the drive to reform the public sector and to  deliver value for money and efficiencies, all of which will enable the  improvement to front-line services that our people deserve.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Those areas will require ongoing monitoring and scrutiny by  the Committee for Finance and Personnel, together with the other statutory  Committees and the wider Assembly, over the next three financial years of the  Budget period.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The period 2008-2011 will present the Executive, and all of  us in the Assembly, with both a challenge and an opportunity to prove that  devolution can make a real difference to people&rsquo;s lives, and that locally  accountable, elected representatives and Ministers can take a much more  sensitive approach to the nuances and the  realities of social and economic life in the North.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I conclude with some remarks in respect of my party role as  spokesperson on economic &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>	      
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My remarks concern the use of public finance initiatives  (PFI). A considerable weight of evidence confirms Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s belief that PFI  and PPP represent poor value for the public purse. Local examples include the  car park project at the Royal Victoria Hospital  and at Balmoral High School. Public Service provision  under PFI will create problems for the Executive in future years. The net  result of setting PFI contracts will be &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Weir: Will the Member give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr McLaughlin: I am sorry.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The net result of setting PFI contracts will be that the  Executive will progressively take on more and <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt; ">more  long-term debt, and, in future, a greater proportion</span> of the total Budget  available to Ministers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in will argue, as will its Ministers, that PFI  contracts are not the preferred option of the Executive. Civil servants, and  others responsible for designing projects, should be instructed to put equal,  or greater, effort into alternative funding models, instead of PPP or PFI  projects.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">12.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">On investment, Sinn F&eacute;in welcomes many of the commitments  in the Programme for Government, the Budget and ISNI II. However, it will be  important that those commitments be turned into reality and that they deliver  for the most disadvantaged in society. Sinn F&eacute;in welcomes the &pound;18 billion that  is to be invested in <span style="letter-spacing:-.05pt; ">the next 10 years. In  particular, we welcome the explicit</span> commitments to the promotion of  social inclusion and <span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt; ">equality in the  procurement of infrastructure programmes.</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, the reviews of water reform, domestic and  industrial rates and Civil Service reform &mdash; as well as the systemic efficiency  programmes across all Departments &mdash; will,  Sinn F&eacute;in expects, demonstrate again the benefits of having a locally  accountable Assembly.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">On regional disparities, Sinn F&eacute;in is concerned that the  commitment in this Budget and in ISNI II to promote regional balance does not  go far enough and may not effectively address the legacy of the past, which has  led to institutionalised disadvantage west of the Bann and in deprived areas  such as north and west Belfast. Sinn F&eacute;in will continue to address that issue  as we go forward.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in will continue to press the Executive and the  Assembly to ensure that a commitment to the eradication of structural regional  inequalities over a timetabled period is accomplished. Furthermore, we want to  see the maximum decentralisation of public-sector jobs to redress historical  disparity and imbalance and to support  balanced regional development.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, there is obvious confusion within the SDLP. I  presume that I have some time, as a result of the interruptions?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Speaker: No, you have 10 minutes.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr McLaughlin: OK.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister for Social Development should consider &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Speaker: Order, Members. The Member has the Floor.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr McLaughlin: The Minister for Social Develop&shy;ment  should consider making a statement to this Assembly and to a bemused public.  Did she seek and receive support from her party leader and colleagues? Is  endorsing the Programme for Government, ISNI II and the Budget compatible with  the party&rsquo;s policies? Last week she and he were proclaiming that their  hard-line negotiating skills were a rationale for voting <span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt; ">for and supporting the final documents at the  Executive&rsquo;s</span> meeting. Perhaps the Minister will explain whether she  proposed any amendments &mdash; the Minister of Finance and Personnel has challenged  that. Did she propose any amendments during those discussions? Did she change  her mind and betray her commitment to her ministerial colleagues, or did her  party wobble when hardy came to hardy and, effectively, abandon her?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Speaker: The Business Committee has arranged to meet  immediately upon the lunchtime suspension today. I propose, therefore, by leave  of the Assembly, to suspend the sitting until 2.00 pm.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The sitting was suspended at 12.32 pm.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">&nbsp;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">On resuming (Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr McClarty] in the  Chair) &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">2.00 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Storey: I should say in the first instance that I  will make my opening remarks in my capacity as an Assembly Member, and I will make my final comments in my  capacity as the Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for Finance and Personnel.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is right and proper that we place on record that we are  debating a Budget at a time when one party in our four-party mandatory  coalition does not seem to know what being  part of that coalition means. </p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Declan O&rsquo;Loan, who is one of my North Antrim constituency  colleagues, said earlier that he would not allow a situation to develop  in which the SDLP would be hung out to dry. It is obvious that he was not  referring to one of his colleagues, Margaret Ritchie, the Minister for Social  Development. The SDLP has done exactly what it said it would not allow: it has  hung the Minister out to dry. </p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">No press conference in this Building today and no attempt  at unity by the SDLP will be able to mask the problems that now exist in that  party. It has a Minister who it has abandoned and does not support. We will  probably see its Members again this afternoon in the political theatre of  voting against the Budget. That is an issue  for their electorate and on which that electorate will undoubtedly pass  comment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, having made those points, which reflect my  personal perspective on the political charade that is going on with the SDLP, I  will move the debate on to discuss the issues that have been of interest to the  Committee of which I am the Deputy Chairperson. At the outset, I thank the  Minister for his remarks.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr P Robinson: We  are currently seeing the spectacle of the Minister for Social  Development being present in the Chamber alongside her party leader.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Deputy Speaker: I ask the Minister to please address  his remarks to the Chair. When Members turn towards others, as the Minister is  doing, the volume disappears somewhat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr P Robinson: That might be a blessing for some, Mr Deputy Speaker. It will certainly be a  blessing for the SDLP. Since both the Minister for Social Development  and her party leader are present, I wonder whether they would answer the  question that was asked earlier: if there were something inherently wrong with  the Programme for Government, the investment strategy or the Budget, why did their Minister table no amendment to those  in Executive meetings? Alternatively, did they shaft their Minister at a later  stage?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Storey: I thank the Minister for his intervention. I  remind him that earlier, the leader of the SDLP commented in the House that his Minister had expressed <span style="letter-spacing:-.25pt; ">reservations. There is a vast difference between  expressing</span> reservations and coming up with ideas, proposals and amendments to a Budget and a draft strategy.  Obviously, the SDLP does not really know where it is going on this  issue.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mrs D Kelly: Will the Member give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Storey: No, I have already given up some of my time,  and I want to get to the substance of the issues that concern the Committee of  which I am the Deputy Chairperson.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Minister of  Finance and Personnel for his remarks and for his opening comments on  the revised Budget. His comments explain the key challenges, pressures and priorities that lie ahead for the  Executive.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The work that the Committee for Finance and Personnel has  done on strategic budgetary issues has already been mentioned. I will focus my  comments on DFP&rsquo;s own Budget allocation and its importance in helping the  Department to achieve the targets that have been  set for it in the Programme for Government and the investment strategy, for which it takes lead  responsibility.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In its response to the draft Budget, the Committee noted that DFP allocation for current expenditure  between 2008 and 2011 represents a significant reduction in the  Department&rsquo;s share of departmental expenditure limit funds. That reflects a  pattern of reduced funding for DFP; even the current year allocation is 17&middot;1%  lower than that of 2006-07. Although the Committee has concerns about the  impact that that reduction could have, it is particularly uneasy about the  Department&rsquo;s capital allocations.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department of Finance  and Personnel submitted a bid for approximately &pound;94&middot;2 million over the  three financial years from 2008 to 2011 but was allocated &pound;68&middot;7 million.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee has  particular concerns over whether the capital allocations to Land and  Property Services will be sufficient to allow the agency to alleviate the  difficulties associated with its IT systems, especially those that deal with  rate relief. Moreover, Land Registers of Northern Ireland and Ordnance Survey  of Northern Ireland will merge with Land and Property Services on 1 April 2008.  Those changes will present a real challenge to an agency that is responsible  for the delivery of important front-line  services. The Committee will continue to pursue the matter, and it has  scheduled a scrutiny of that area of  concern into its work programme over the coming weeks.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee has already produced a report on Workplace  2010, and it continues to scrutinise the future  progress and direction of that project. That major accommodation project  will affect all Departments and is expected to generate approximately &pound;175  million in capital receipts during the  Budget period.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee has  also expressed concerns to DFP about the apparent delay in the implementation  of Workplace 2010. That delay came to light when the Committee considered the  Department&rsquo;s input into the revised Programme for Government. The Committee  will investigate that matter further tomorrow, when it will also examine the  findings of the evaluation of the Workplace 2010 pilot project at Clare House.  The potential consequences for the Budget of  any significant delay in implementing Workplace 2010 will be of  particular concern.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department of Finance and Personnel has lead  responsibility for other key reform programmes, such as NI Direct, which will  ultimately provide a single telephone point of contact for public services and  the various shared-service centres, including HR Connect, Account NI and Records NI. The Committee  recognises that those reform programmes underpin the Budget, in that they will contribute to achieving wider  efficiency targets and will allow accrued savings to be redirected into  the delivery of key front-line services. However, the Committee has recently  been informed that the reform programme,  including NI Direct, is to be funded out of future monitoring rounds.  Consequently, the Committee is concerned that that approach attaches some uncertainty to funding for those important  projects, and that, in turn, could result in delays and affect the wider  efficiency drive. Such important, high-profile programmes, particularly in the  case of NI Direct, will require priority.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee was also concerned about the Department&rsquo;s  allocation for improvements in the energy performance of Government buildings  and for measures linked to the sustainable development strategy, because those  allocations run contrary to the prominence that the Executive afforded  sustainability in the Programme for Government. I have pointed to the relative  decline in the resource available to DFP, and it is intended that that will be  supplemented through efficiency savings.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department has a target to deliver cash-releasing  efficiencies of &pound;5&middot;7 million, &pound;10&middot;3 million and &pound;14&middot;8 million respectively over  the next three financial years. Such efficiency targets will present DFP, and  other Departments, with a considerable challenge. The Committee will continue  to scrutinise regularly DFP&rsquo;s progress in achieving its efficiency delivery  plan, and it has recommended that the other Statutory Committees do likewise.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As was mentioned earlier, one of the major strategic issues that has arisen from the Committee&rsquo;s  investigation is the unacceptable level of underspend across Depart&shy;ments.  Such moneys could be used to tackle a range of ongoing needs rather than be  left to accumulate at year-end. The Department of Finance and Personnel has a  key role to play in leading the drive to minimise underspending, and the  Committee will monitor the progress that the Department makes in driving the  financial-management agenda and the way in which it leads by example, by ensuring the efficiency forecasting and  monitoring of its own expenditure, and thereby minimising its underspend.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">To conclude, the Committee will also continue to monitor  the impact that the resource and capital allocations proposed for the  Department of Finance and Personnel in the revised Budget will have on  delivery, and how the Department plans to manage with allocations that are  significantly below the amount sought. I support the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr McNarry: I wish to make it clear from the outset  that I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s assurance that there  will be scope to revise spending plans if necessary. That is an important commitment to record,  particularly given the restrictions within which his Department has had  to work in preparing the Budget.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Buzzwords have bounced  around the Chamber lately. Expressions such as &ldquo;we are where we are&rdquo; and  &ldquo;it is time to move on&rdquo; are, no doubt, meant to encourage a feel-good factor  and demonstrate that devolution is working. However, last week, the Minister of  Finance and Personnel sounded a cautionary  note in his foreword to the Budget document:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Recent years have seen above average rates of growth  in public spending which will sharply decelerate in the coming three years. This will undoubtedly cause difficulties and  challenges in terms of the need to  prioritise resources on where they will result in most benefit.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Ulster Unionists recognised that warning. Indeed,  we first sounded it some time ago.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister may recall grimacing as he said hello to me  last week after his Budget statement. I recall that because I am more used to  the grimace than the hello these days. He will remember that when I passed him,  I said: &ldquo;That was all right.&rdquo; That is true; his statement was simply that &mdash; it  was not brilliant or great, it was just as I told him: it was all right.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">This Budget represents a weak cocktail mix &mdash; it has no  fizz. Why is that? The Minister knows what we all know: that this Budget lacks  the sparkle of the promised financial package from Gordon Brown, on which there  was no delivery. So tight is the Budget that it is close to imploding. It  squeezes spending out of the efficiencies to such an extent that no one knows  for certain whether the 3% efficiency targets can be met.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, we know that if only half the savings are made, a  shortfall of &pound;435 million will mean a large hole in the Budget. This is a  high-wire Budget, and if it has a safety net, perhaps the Minister will tell us  how far he can fall before he ejects himself from office, or runs for help. I  am rather caught between two stools on that  matter. On one hand, the very thought of the Minister ejecting himself  from office is most appealing. On the other hand &mdash; perhaps I will leave that  for another day.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I shall outline the  Ulster Unionist Party&rsquo;s position from this secure premise: its Members  are in Government as of right, and they are there to assert the mandate that  has been given to our party. That mandate has led to our taking on more  financial responsibility than any other party in the Executive. Those  responsibilities see two Ulster Unionist Ministers controlling over 56% of the revenue allocations. Contrast that with the  percentages for the parties that control the votes in this House: the  DUP, with its four Ministers, is responsible for only 8% of the revenue  allocations; and Sinn F&eacute;in, with its three Ministers, musters 30%. Not even the  combined score of those two parties&rsquo; seven Ministers gets close to our 56%.  Therefore, we will not vote against the Budget, which was agreed by our Ministers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am proud of the stand that was taken by our party&rsquo;s MLAs and Ministers when first declaring our  resistance to the draft Budget. Today&rsquo;s final Budget agreement justifies  our stance. If our Ministers had rolled over and bowed the knee to the spurious  accusations that were levelled at them &mdash; which, in one instance, led to the  suspension of the Chairperson of the Health Committee &mdash; the Budget would not  have been agreed, nor would it have been  inclusive of the entire Executive.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The fact that Ulster Unionists hold responsibility for over  56% of the revenue allocation signifies our commitment to real responsibility,  none of which we will walk away from. However, the party&rsquo;s concerns and  reservations also illustrate responsible thinking. We will monitor every  decision that is taken. We will not tell the electorate that it is acceptable  to wait 40, 50 or even 100 years before a road can be repaired; or that child  poverty will be eradicated by 2010, when it will not; or that the poorest of  our families will have to pay for water when they cannot afford to; or that  there is a &ldquo;live now, pay after death&rdquo; system for fixed-income pensioners in  respect of water charges.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">How can we drum up support for a capital spend on sport of  &pound;111 million when &pound;70 million of that is to be set aside for a stadium for  which there is, as yet, no business case? Who knows when or where it will be  built, or, indeed, whether it will be built at all? Remove that &pound;70 million,  and the remaining balance of &pound;41 million leaves little to go around for sport  in the next three years.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Education is in a total mess, with parents, pupils and  teachers up in arms about the policy efficiencies of a rudderless Department  that badly needs a new Minister and a  change in policy direction. Who can guarantee that any money that is given to that Minister will be  properly spent for the benefit of children in Northern Ireland?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In essence, the Budget  is reliant on efficiency savings of 3% being made. Any slippage could  cause serious chaos or freefall. Independent  economic analysis suggests that it will be virtually impossible to  achieve 3% savings. However, in a rather bullish statement that was reprinted  in last Saturday&rsquo;s &lsquo;News Letter&rsquo;, the Minister boasted that as a first step,  domestic regional rates will be frozen for three years. He went on to say:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;the average household&hellip;will be &pound;1,000 better off.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Last week, Graeme Harrison, a leading economist with Oxford  Economics was quoted in &lsquo;The Irish News&rsquo; as saying:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Northern Ireland  is likely to face pressure to balance its books as domestic rates bills are  much lower than in Britain.  If this time comes, rates may rise quite significantly which will be a bitter  pill to swallow.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It would be a bitter  pill indeed for average householders should water charges tap into their  household income and leave them &pound;1,000 worse off.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Is the Assembly being somewhat reckless in overstating a  Budget, the delivery of which is built on speculation? What will happen if  crucial efficiency targets are not met? What contingency plans are in place  should efficiency savings fail to materialise? How will the Departments  distinguish between cuts and savings? What happens if the efficiencies unravel  and the Executive are forced to increase rates bills substantially to balance  the books?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My party&rsquo;s contribution to today&rsquo;s debate will be  constructive and penetrating. Our participation in the House is the same as in  the Executive: we act in good faith, with the aim of reaching as broad a  consensus as possible. However, make no mistake: we will retain our serious  reservations about the Budget until we are satisfied that they are no longer  valid.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Those who attempt to browbeat the UUP Ministers, or any of my colleagues, and who once chided  members of my party as being pushovers, should take a good look at  themselves. Perceived dominance is a kidding machine. Those people should take  some friendly advice from me: they, not the UUP, are responsible for making the  daily headlines that do not cover them in glory. Commentators, columnists and  the letters pages are pulling their parties &mdash; not mine &mdash; to bits.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Ulster Unionists have moved on: we are reinvigorated,  and we relish the challenges that lie ahead  in the Executive, the Committees, and in building our relationships with  the public. Ulster Unionists will step up to the mark on the Budget: where it  succeeds, and we hope that it does, we will applaud it. Where it fails, and our  reservations point to the probability of some serious failures, we will denounce  it. For now, the Ulster Unionist Party joins  its Ministers in approving the Budget.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Hamilton: I congratulate the Minister and all his Executive colleagues on agreeing the Budget,  which is a significant document for any legislature. In today&rsquo;s Northern  Ireland Assembly, it represents a major milestone on the road away from direct  rule. The four parties that are in power  represent 90% of the population. For those four parties &mdash; the DUP, Sinn  F&eacute;in, the Ulster Unionists and the SDLP &mdash; to  agree unanimously to a three-year Budget would have been unimaginable a  year ago. It is a positive Budget for Northern Ireland, and it marks a  distinct departure from direct rule.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I particularly welcome the continuing focus on growing a  vibrant and dynamic economy for Northern    Ireland &mdash; our number one priority. However,  having that as our number one priority does not mean that investment in public  services is not required. In the Budget, there will be more than &pound;4 billion  worth of spending a year on health, an additional &pound;400 million a year for  education, and ambitious public capital investment  in infrastructure, including schools, hospitals, public transport and  other public services, to the tune of some &pound;2 billion a year. That is  significant, and it is needed to help achieve the goal of growing Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  economy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Freezing the domestic regional rate, capping the industrial  rate, and the clear focus in the Budget on much-needed efficiencies and on  performance are recognition that the people of Northern Ireland have paid  enough and have not received the outputs that their inputs have deserved.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, in spite of all of those positives, and I could  mention many more, there are doom merchants, naysayers and nit-pickers who have  pored over the document and have suddenly &mdash; compared to others who have been  consistently opposed to it &mdash; become eleventh-hour converts to opposing the  Budget. I am referring, of course, to the SDLP.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is worth remembering that as far as the current Budget  process is concerned, all Ministers must agree to every aspect of the Budget.  It is not sufficient for Ministers to agree only to their individual  departmental allocations &mdash; obviously, they will have a particular interest in  those. Ministers must agree to every single piece of the Budget, every line,  every pound and every penny.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Serious questions have to be posed about what has been  written in the press and what has been said in the Chamber today. First, is the  SDLP riven with division? Did Margaret Ritchie defy her party&rsquo;s directions? Did  she fail to deliver on what her party asked  her to achieve in the Executive? Those questions need to be asked,  especially given that the Minister of Finance and Personnel has said that  Minister Ritchie proposed no amendments to the draft Budget.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The only other possibility,  which is much more serious, is that Margaret Ritchie&rsquo;s approval of the  Budget in the Executive &mdash; and her likely endorsement of it this evening, if she  wants to remain in office &mdash; was deliberately dishonourable. That is the serious  issue that she has to address.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I look forward to seeing her in the Lobby later &mdash; I am sure  that I will. However, her party colleagues who will trot through the other  Lobby at the same time will be holding what  is tantamount to a vote of no confidence in her ability. That is an issue that she needs to seriously  reflect on, and she should watch her back. Perhaps she needs to get her  retaliation in first. I am not sure what the SDLP&rsquo;s role is &mdash; its Minister will  be voting for a Budget that her Assembly colleagues will be voting against.  Perhaps its role will evolve over the course of the day.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I do know what the  Alliance Party&rsquo;s role is. However, they are not effective in fulfilling  it.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Ford: Is that the best you can manage, Simon?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Hamilton: I am just starting, David. In all  seriousness, I find it curious that a party, which for decades piously  pronounced that it was time for people to get together and work together for  the betterment of Northern    Ireland, is now taking such a position. In  many ways, it is opposing its raison d&rsquo;etre; it is opposing what it has been  proposing for years.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Alliance Party Members may think that they are the tough  guys and that they are talking tough; however, I honestly do not think that their supporters will appreciate what  the party is doing, especially given what it has been selling them through the  years. <span class="B3BodyTextItalicChar"><span style="font-size:11.0pt; ">[Interruption.]</span></span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that it is not because of anything that I said.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The cost-of-division argument has been wheeled out as the  main fiscal argument once again. However, the Alliance Party has another  argument, which I will address later. It knows that its alternative is  unrealistic. The Alliance Party&rsquo;s arguments on the cost of division have been  derided by UNISON &mdash; which has been no friend  of the Minister of Finance during the consultation on the draft Budget &mdash; and in its submission on the  draft Budget those arguments have been called &ldquo;delusions&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to examine the matters that are included in  &lsquo;The Cost of Division &mdash; A Shared Future Strategy&rsquo;, and I would love to be able  to click my fingers and make the actual cost of division disappear overnight.  The maximum potential figure of &pound;1&middot;5 billion that is cited in the report  includes various costs, such as responsibilities of the Northern Ireland Office  and aspects of security, which would not automatically come back to the  Assembly in any case. I heard your contribution to the Programme for Government  debate yesterday, Mr Deputy Speaker, when you excoriated the Alliance Party  quite effectively on that point.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The report also  included the funding of the Historical Enquiries Team, and the Alliance  Party must be asked whether it would like to see that body disappear.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Dr Farry: On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. Is it  appropriate for a Member to refer to comments that were made by the Deputy  Speaker when he was speaking from the Benches as a private Member, and then  refer to him as the Deputy Speaker during a subsequent debate?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Deputy Speaker: That is not relevant to today&rsquo;s  business, Dr Farry.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Hamilton: You are very wise, Mr Deputy Speaker: two  good comments in two days &mdash; you are on a roll.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The report also suggests that if bonfires were eliminated,  we could save thousands of pounds every year. Perhaps the authors of the report  do not attend many bonfires, because even if division in society ended, I  suspect that bonfires would not disappear for ever. Perhaps we will have guys.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are potentially quite significant savings to be made in education, but the Alliance Party, when  presented with an opportunity in the House to vote against the  Irish-medium club bank to stop the inappropriate further disintegration of  education, voted for it. That will further entrench division in our education  system.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Alliance Party is not a one-trick pony any more &mdash; it  now has two tricks on fiscal matters. The Alliance Party is telling the people,  the households and the businesses of Northern Ireland that it wants to  see their taxes rise, and, if it has its  way, they will rise significantly. Under the last five years of direct  rule, the people of Northern    Ireland faced a 60% domestic regional rate  rise, including a 19% rise in one year.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Alliance Party characterised this as a low-tax Budget.  That is a label that the DUP and I would be very happy to pick up and wear with  immense pride. After enduring years of double-digit rate rises, the people have  made a large enough contribution, and it is time for them to receive the  performance that they deserve. A Budget that will freeze the domestic regional  rate, effect an 8% cut over the three-year period and cap the industrial rate  is to be welcomed, not criticised. A Budget that means that the average  household in Northern Ireland  will be around &pound;1,000 better off over the three-year period, compared to direct  rule, is best for Northern    Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Alliance Party has bashed householders and  manufacturers, and has now turned its attention to bashing farmers. I wonder  when they are going to bash little old  ladies, because it seems that no one is immune when it comes to from  whom the Alliance Party will take taxes. The Alliance Party is in opposition,  the job of which is to propose attractive policies so that people will vote for  them. If that is the type of policy that the Alliance Party believes people are  going to vote for, it may as well get used to its role, because it will be in  it for a very long time.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">This Budget marks a  significant change for Northern<span style="letter-spacing:0pt; "> Ireland</span>, and it represents a move in the right direction.  The agreement of a unanimous Budget is to be whole&shy;heartedly welcomed by  everyone in the House. I give it my support, and I look forward to seeing the  now-departed Minister for Social Development supporting it too.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Deputy Speaker: Thankfully, she has departed only  temporarily.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Ms J McCann: Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I  welcome the debate on the Budget and the opportunity to take part in it. One of  the most positive elements of the Budget is  that local, accountable political representatives are setting the  priorities and Budget allocations, rather than direct rule Ministers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Budget is by no means perfect, but it is a first step  in delivering real change to the people living in the North of Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">2.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The fact that there is such a high level of public interest  in the draft Budget, which was shown by the number of people who responded to  the consultation process, indicates that people have high expectations of local  political representatives to deliver the changes necessary to make our quality  of life better.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to  build a dynamic, innovative economy, but it is equally important to  ensure that poverty, disadvantage and inequality are addressed. The economy in  the North of Ireland is characterised by unacceptable and unsustainable levels  of poverty that expose the extent of discrimination and disadvantage in our  society. Some 31% of 16- to 60-year-olds lack paid work; 22% of the workforce  is low paid; and nearly 25% of households  are unable to afford adequate home heating. Nearly 100,000 children and  50,000 pensioners are living in income  poverty, and 3,000 people die prematurely each year as a result of  disadvantage and poverty.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the past, we have had no control over our resources,  which has resulted in an economy with patterns that have, year after year,  produced alarming evidence of intensifying inequality and disadvantage.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mrs D Kelly: Will the Member give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Ms J McCann: No.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We must correct the huge infrastructure deficit resulting  from successive failures to invest in essential services, such as water, the  sewerage system, transport, hospitals and education. It is our commitment to  address discrimination and disadvantage that is at the very source of our  opportunity to overcome what is morally and economically unsustainable. For  example, by looking at how all public procurement expenditure can integrate  economic and social requirements, along with ring-fencing projects that  directly impact on discrimination and poverty, ways can be found that can begin  to challenge those patterns of disadvantage.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is a huge budget  for procurement, and we need to agree measures, such as local labour,  clauses that will ensure that procurement  meets equality conditions. For example, companies that receive contracts  should meet base conditions, which would  include good wages and employment of apprenticeships, and thus they would contribute to local economic welfare and  growth.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Unfortunately, the British Government have ignored repeated  cross-party representations to make special provision  for the North of Ireland as a society emerging from conflict, with all  the social and economic disadvantages that that brings. Instead, we are faced  with an unfair Barnett settlement &mdash; the outworking of which can be seen in the  draft Budget &mdash; and a drive to privatise public services.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The block grant from the British Government is inadequate and does not allow the Executive to  challenge fully the years of underinvestment by successive British  Governments. Notwithstanding the context of that financial shortfall, as well  as the absence of a developed all-Ireland economy, until we have control over  our own fiscal powers, we will continue to carry the burden of trying to match  limited resources with increasing needs.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are, of course, several areas where it will be  necessary to examine and to continue to lobby for resources in different  Departments.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mrs D Kelly: Will the Member give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Ms J McCann: No.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Public service provision under PFI is an area that needs to  be examined and its shortfalls challenged. PFI and PPP contracts require public  bodies to enter into long-term contracts  that involve them borrowing money at a higher rate of interest than  normal. Government can borrow at a lower interest rate than the private sector.  Therefore, PFI and PPP contracts &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Deputy Speaker: Members, please allow the Member to  continue.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Ms J McCann: Therefore, PFI and PPP contracts can cost  the taxpayer more in the longer term. </p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The social economy is another area that deserves special  recognition. We must recognise the important and significant contribution of such local economic activity, which  promotes social objectives and sustainable community development. That industry  has already created sustainable jobs. The development of the social economy should be actively promoted by the  Assembly and the Executive.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The community and  voluntary sector has been starved of  core funding. An ongoing lobbying process must take place to ensure specific Departments allocate the  resources necessary to core fund  those front-line services delivered through the community and voluntary  sector.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mrs D Kelly: Will the Member give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Ms J McCann: No.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Moneys could be ring-fenced, particularly in the Department  for Social Development. Many services, including  the Youth Service, are due to finish in March and June of this year. Many  are losing Peace II funding, with no alternative measures in place to  sustain their projects, even though they have been central to delivering  opportunities for community training and development, education, promotion of  good relations, and initiatives for children and young people.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department for Social Development must be creative and  imaginative in finding ways to retain the skills and expertise that have been  acquired in that sector and that have helped to promote and sustain citizenship  and peace. Many communities in west Belfast,  other parts of the city and across the North of Ireland have serious concerns  about the future of the community sector. Therefore, it is unacceptable that a  report on the future of that sector, which argued for mainstream long-term  funding for community organi&shy;sations, has still not been acted upon, despite  being presented to the Department for Social Development several years ago.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The revised Budget, alongside the Programme for Government  and the investment strategy, should be a vehicle to empower communities through  economic initiatives. Departments should  commit to building social capital through funded, participative community-level  initiatives that lead to sustainable economic projects, which would be  beneficial to all in the community.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am disappointed that the Budget does not mention women as  a specific group that faces inequality and discrimination. I expected the  Budget to reflect the commitment, which the Executive made in the Programme for  Government, to tackling the remaining gender inequalities in society. That  commitment was written into the Programme for Government at Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s insistence, and I intend to ensure that  all Depart&shy;ments honour it. </p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the Programme for Government, the Executive make a  commitment to implementing the cross-departmental gender-equality strategy and  to work towards the total elimination of the gender pay gap. The Executive are  also committed to developing effective  programmes and strategies aimed at eradicating all forms of violence  against women and to ensuring a significant  increase in women&rsquo;s participation in political and public life, which  will be helped by ensuring that women have access to affordable, quality  childcare.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although all those gains in the Programme for Government  are welcome, it is important that financial support and resources are made  available to deliver on those commitments.  Sinn F&eacute;in intends to use the agreed mechanisms  for delivering equality, including the equality impact assessment  process.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, as I said at the outset, the fact that local  political representatives, rather than direct rule Ministers, have set the priorities and Budget allocations that  will affect local people&rsquo;s lives for the next few years must be seen as a  positive step forward. It is a positive  first step, but much more work must be done to ensure that inequality,  discrimination and disadvantage are rigorously challenged and tackled. All  people in the North of Ireland are entitled to a much better quality of life.  It is the responsibility of local representatives, along with others, to ensure  that that is delivered. We must take the process forward, because people are  expecting their local politicians to deliver. There is much goodwill out there,  but people expect a lot from us. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Deputy Speaker: I commend the Member for Upper Bann  Mrs Kelly for taking rejection very well.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Weir: Like Ms McCann, I support the Budget. However,  unlike her, I might manage to make some positive comments about it to justify  my going through the Lobbies. I look forward to seeing Ms McCann, and others,  in the Lobbies tonight in support of the four-party  Budget that the Executive approved unanimously.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Budget marks an important departure for Northern Ireland  in three crucial respects. It stands in sharp contrast to the direct rule  Budgets that were imposed upon us in the past. First, the draft Budget went out  to consultation, and today we see the finished product. As local politicians,  we are used to seeing the Government  consulting on various proposals. Responses and strenuous arguments for  changes might be made, but they always seemed to fall on deaf ears. As the revised Budget shows, the Executive have been  listening, and they have considered genuine concerns and met genuine  pressures without diverting the Budget from its  central purpose. The Executive have shown flexibility, while retaining  the Budget&rsquo;s strength.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Many words of praise have been heaped upon the Minister of  Finance and Personnel for organising the Budget and the consultation process.  However, praise must also go to the hard-working special adviser and officials  in the Department who successfully aided the Minister in producing that  excellent work.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I highlighted three areas where a departure from the past was merited. The second of those is the opportunity to be responsive and listen.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The economy is at the heart of the Budget, in both the  draft and the final versions. Here is a challenge to all of us to shift away  from our mindset. In the past, the tendency has been to concentrate on how the  cake has been carved up. When we were faced  with problems, we asked for more cake. Ultimately, however, the long-term  economic success of Northern    Ireland will be based on a strong economy.  The Budget shows the way. In achieving that  strong economy, it is not a question of redressing the balance between  the public and private sectors by reducing the size of the public sector.  Examination of the Budget shows record levels of commitment to the public  sector. For example, the vast growth of the allocation to the Health Service  and the additional money for social housing  that has been found in the final Budget will make a major contribution  to society. It is not so much reducing the public sector that is vital, but  creating economic conditions that make for growth in the private sector. The  Alliance Party has thrown at us the accusation that we have been trying to  create a low-tax economy that will allow the private sector to flourish. That  is a badge of honour that I am happy to wear.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Consider the regional rate. We have seen massive increases,  driven, in part, by the agreement on the reinvestment and reform initiative.  That meant that taxpayers and ratepayers in Northern Ireland have, in recent years, been bled dry. Now, however, the  domestic regional rate has been frozen for the next three years; and the  business rate will be kept in line with inflation. The Executive have responded  to requests from the manufacturing sector to  hold down the level of derating, which will give a much-needed boost to  our economy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The third area in which there has been a departure from  past practice, is one on which the focus will fall in the future. The Budget  concentrates, not simply on the levels of allocation given to various  Departments, but &mdash; as was shown in the Minister&rsquo;s statement last week &mdash; on  delivery. Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  citizens will expect that. That is what matters to people: not that we have a  more expensive system, or that we have one that is better-funded, but that  delivery makes a difference to their day-to-day lives.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Consequently &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Gallagher: I thank the Member for giving way. Does  he agree that, in future, local government will have an important part to play  in service delivery? Since local government and central Government have  co-operated in preparing the modernisation agenda, does the Member agree that  it is disappointing that no money has been identified in the Budget for the  next three years for taking that forward?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Weir: Money will be made available for  modernisation. It is hoped that, in the near future, the Executive will make  decisions on the review of public administration.  Matters will flow from that. The Budget has been put in place for the  next three years; there needs to be modernisation of local government, and that  requires investment. However, the sums required can be dealt with through in-year monitoring, and focused on activities  that will be of benefit.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There must be much greater co-operation between local  government and central Government to ensure that there is proper delivery. All  Members can point to parts of the Province where, in the past, Government  buildings, one after another, have been put side-by-side and there has been no  efficiency of delivery. However, the Budget concentrates on delivery.  Performance and efficiency delivery units (PEDU) will lead to savings.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Indeed, it is hoped that the pressure on Departments to  generate efficiency savings of 3% will result in resources being targeted to  where they are most needed &mdash; the front-line delivery of services. Therefore,  there is much to commend in the Budget.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Through its amendment,  the Alliance Party has taken a rather predictable path. It maintains  that recovering the cost of division is the silver bullet that will cure all  social ills &mdash; it is as though a wave of that magic wand will produce immediate  savings. I am reminded of the idea that the Liberal Democrats had in the 1980s  of increasing income tax by 1p. The plan was that, as time went by, that  increase would pay for more and more services. It seems that some think that  finding an immediate cure to the cost of division is the magic solution to  every social ill.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I look forward to the  Supplementary Estimates, when the Alliance Party will actually put some  meat on the bones of its proposals and make suggestions. If money is to be  diverted to other activities, let us hear where that party wants to make changes, what schools it wants to close  and what roads it does not want to be built. Let us hear what concrete  proposals it is prepared to make.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although the Alliance Party is wrong in its assertion that recovering the cost of division is the magic  solution, at least it deserves credit for its consistency. It might be  consistently wrong, but at least it is consistent. Indeed, the party has  sounded like a stuck record throughout the lifetime of this Assembly.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, at least there is a little bit of logic in its position,  unlike that of the party opposite, the SDLP, whose Minister agreed with the  Budget. Not only did she agree with the elements of the Budget that affect her  Department, she agreed with the Budget in its entirety. Like a family pet that  is adopted at Christmas and abandoned on Boxing Day once the children are tired playing with it, Margaret Ritchie has been  abandoned by the Members opposite. She will cut a lonely figure when she  walks through the Aye Lobby.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is clear that the SDLP is playing games with the Budget. It is trying to have its cake and eat it.  It is trying to be part of the Government, trying to claim whatever  successes emerge from the Budget, particularly those that emerge from the Department for Social Development, while  saying &ldquo;nothing to do with me, guv&rdquo;, as though it had nothing to do with the  Budget. In fact, the SDLP has demonstrated political immaturity on the issue.  It has pretended, Pontius Pilate-like, to wash its hands of the Budget while  allowing its own Minister to traipse through the Aye Lobby in its favour. That  shows that its stance is fundamentally flawed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The people of Northern Ireland will welcome the  Budget. It is a Budget for business and economic growth, and it will deliver  for everyone.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Beggs: I am amazed at the Alliance Party&rsquo;s  amendment, which calls for a revised programme of expenditure to be developed  at this late stage. The amendment does not even mention specific financial  amendments that ought to be made to the Budget.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There seems to be a complete lack of understanding about  how late the Budget is already. It is normally completed in December, but it  has been delayed until January because of  the comprehensive spending review. It must be understood that the  process involves not just finalising departmental budgets. For example, once  the education budget has been finalised, the Department of Education must  cascade its allocation to the various boards. When will schools find out how  much money they are getting? It takes time  for money to be cascaded down through  Departments. Therefore, there are dangers in delaying a final judgement  on the Budget.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If the Alliance Party is dissatisfied with issues in the  Budget, why did it not propose specific amendments that could have been  debated? Is it merely copying the DUP of old by tabling token amendments just  so that it can vote against the Budget? Some people might call that  grandstanding.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Ulster Unionist Party contributed to the draft Budget  by giving constructive criticism and by seeking further information. The Finance  Minister and me have been involved in some toing and froing on the lack of  evidence of a financial package. The contentious nature of the Budget shows  that it is obvious that there is little evidence of a &pound;1 billion financial  package. The Assembly was promised that the  outcomes of the Varney Review would boost Northern Ireland&rsquo;s economic  prospects. However, Varney I failed to deliver anything of note, and that has  spawned Varney II.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Earlier, Mitchel McLaughlin criticised the achieve&shy;ments of  David Trimble and Mark Durkan during their engagements with the Treasury.  However, they gained access to reinvestment and reform initiative funding, and  many valuable former army bases were to be given to Northern Ireland&rsquo;s Executive to  benefit the local economy. By comparison,  the &ldquo;Chuckle Brothers&rdquo; seem to have gained little from their solo visit  to London.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to return to some other remaining areas of concern.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mrs D Kelly: Will the Member give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Beggs: Yes.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mrs D Kelly: Success &mdash; it just goes to show that one  should try, try and try again. I thank the Member for giving way. Will he agree  that it was the Ulster Unionist Party and the SDLP who set up the Strategic  Investment Board &mdash; a point that has been forgotten by the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in?  They voted against having the board; yet it now forms the core of their  economic development and investment strategies.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Beggs: It is amazing how some parties can do speedy  U-turns when they realise their errors.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is no agreed method for water charging and for  ensuring affordability, and I ask the Minister of Finance and Personnel and the  Minister for Regional Development to state  why it is taking so long to formulate detailed  financial proposals on what is facing the people. Budget proposals will  impact on water charging, and it is disappointing that, nine months after  devolution, no firm proposals are available. Clearly, those who are responsible  for finance and water must answer for that. </p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although I accept that the Northern Ireland public has been  paying for water through the rating system, and will continue to pay for water,  I would like to make it clear that the Ulster Unionist Party does not support  water payments that will be based solely on the value of houses. Aside from the inequality of such a proposal, it also fails to address the EU water framework  directive, which requires water conservation measures to result from the  charging mechanism.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Northern Ireland Water and the water regulator have  expressed concerns about the achievability of the 40% efficiency target, and I  understand that it has been reduced to 35%. Is the target achievable in the  short term? What will happen if it is not achieved?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Much of the capital investment discussed in the Assembly  concerns releasing existing capital and reinvesting it, and more work needs to  be done in that area. However, the Assembly is still blind as far as the report  that was passed to the Minister of Finance and Personnel in December is  concerned. As that report will have major  implications for capital funding proposals, when will it be published, and why has it been withheld prior to  the debate on the Budget? When will the assets be sold, and will they reach  their true value?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Significant sums of  money are contained in the Budget to  redevelop land formerly used by the Northern Ireland Office and the  Ministry of Defence and to assist in improving sporting infrastructure prior to  the 2012 Olympic Games. I hope to see the full business case for the proposed  stadium at the Maze soon, and I hope that details have not been withheld  deliberately so as to enable funding to be included in the Budget.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr S Wilson: This is a totally new revelation from the  Ulster Unionist Party. Did the Member say that he was looking for forward to  seeing the business case for a stadium at  the Maze? Is this one of the Ulster Unionist Party&rsquo;s new policies?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Beggs: Would the Member allow me to finish my point? I urge that full infrastructure costs  are included in such a business case because there is potential for much  folly in talking solely about a stadium. It is important that the full  implications of creating an efficient transport system to, and from, such a  stadium are included. I suspect that when that is done, it will put a huge  question mark over the proposals.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Significant capital underfunding has resulted from delays  in the planning system in Northern    Ireland. Will that continue to happen, or  will it be possible to ensure a six-month turnaround of capital investment  proposals to ensure that we, in turn, will not incur underspending and  mismanagement of public funding?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I share the views that Declan O&rsquo;Loan expressed on domestic  rates. The Finance Minister claims that the Budget will make households in Northern Ireland  &pound;1,000 better off. On 23 January 2008, in &lsquo;The Irish News&rsquo;, Graeme Harrison, a  leading economist with Oxford Economics, challenged that claim. He said that it  was difficult to pin down:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;exactly how civil servants arrived at their figure of  &pound;1,000&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Householders will not feel better off by &pound;1,000  when they experience the full cost of water bills, the charges of which are  lined up for significant increases in future years. We would be better off  without the spin.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">During the run-up to the Budget, I asked a number of  written and oral questions to the Office of the First Minister and deputy First  Minister on departmental funding and North/South bodies. One question has not  been answered and remains of concern to me: what is the purpose of the huge  increase in funding under the heading of &ldquo;Support for Government and other  services&rdquo;? In 2001-02, &pound;9&middot;273 million was allocated under that heading, and in  2006-07, that allocation was &pound;13&middot;529 million. In the Budget for 2007-08, the  NIO conveniently increased that figure by 40% to &pound;18&middot;93 million, which is more  than double the amount that was allocated during the last period of devolution.  I continue to seek further information on that matter, and I will continue to  monitor that situation and to seek an assurance that money is being well spent  &mdash; but I have considerable concerns that it is not.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the past, the DUP has conveniently used paltry sums &mdash;  for example, its removal of approximately &pound;1 million from funding for  North/South bodies &mdash; to justify an amendment and to vote against a Budget as a  grandstanding, spoiling mechanism. Along with my Ulster Unionist colleagues, I  do not wish to adopt a spoiling mechanism, although we could justifiably do so.  We do not want to spoil, but we will continue to monitor and question  expenditure.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We accept that we have a role to play in giving stability  to the critical Budget process, and, therefore, to the stability of Northern Ireland,  which will enable economic progress. We would not be thanked if, during the  run-up to the economic conference that is planned for May 2008, we were to  expose Northern Ireland  as fragile. Therefore, it is important that we all take difficult decisions.  From that point of view, I support the Budget.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr P Ramsey: It is  a pity that Peter Weir and Simon Hamilton are not in the Chamber, but in  response to their comments, I point out that the SDLP has made no eleventh-hour  conversion on its position on the Budget or Programme for Government. We have  been clear about the need for a consistent, constructive and responsible  approach in the Chamber, outside the Chamber,  and at Committee level. The SDLP amendment highlights the areas of the Budget that we are concerned about.  We will not be censored or silenced, and we will certainly not be bullied into  submission by any other party. We are a democratic party, and we have the right  to raise issues that are of concern to us.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As the SDLP spokesperson on culture, arts and leisure, I  will focus on sport and the arts. The SDLP places a high value on sport at  individual, community, regional, national and international levels. Sport  contributes to the physical and mental health of people and communities; it helps to build community cohesion and  esteem; it helps to build regional and national recognition and reputation;  and, internationally, it has an ambassadorial role to play through sports  people, teams and supporters. When those  factors are considered, the benefits of sport represent a strong return  on the investment that is made.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP also recognises the immense contribution that volunteers make to sporting and community  bodies across Northern    Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.00 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Sport probably attracts more voluntary effort than any other sector, and that effort provides immense  added value to Government spending. We are concerned that sport has not  been allocated the necessary funding. The investment strategy for Northern Ireland  states that the Executive:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;will invest in a range of new, and improved sports  facilities to a standard comparable with  other similar UK  regions, providing world class facilities and places for playing and  watching sport that are accessible to all.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That worthy aim will prove difficult, given the  capital allocation to sport over the next three years. The SDLP is concerned that sport will be under-resourced in  capital and revenue allocations.  That will have a negative impact on our ability to implement the draft  strategy for sport and physical recreation, which went out to public  consultation in October 2007. The Government will be unable to deliver the  stadia safety programme, and the ability to deliver 10 Olympic centres of  excellence will also be seriously jeopardised. No money will be made available  from central Government to build community sports facilities, and there will be  no money for local rugby, soccer or Gaelic  football clubs. Although officials from the Department of Culture, Arts  and Leisure tell us that if the Maze project goes ahead, the Department of  Finance and Personnel will receive &pound;80 million, some of which may be ploughed  back into sport, that is a nonsense.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The draft sports strategy is wide-ranging, covering sport  from community to international level. Although many groups are critical of aspects of the strategy, there is no  doubt that its scale and potential benefits are ambitious. The capital that is  required to deliver the strategy from 2008-2011 is &pound;260 million. Those are not my figures. Only &pound;112 million is allocated in the  Budget, leaving a shortfall of more than 50%. The draft sports strategy  requires revenue funding of &pound;101&nbsp;million, but the Budget allocates &pound;34  million, which amounts to a shortfall of almost 70%.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are serious concerns about the ability to deliver on  important areas of the draft sports strategy, such as the sports stadiums  safety programme, Olympic centres of excellence and community facilities. Over  the past seven years, the stadia safety programme has delivered health and safety improvements at major sports  grounds across Northern Ireland.  The Budget makes no provision whatsoever for a continued programme of  investment in our major sports grounds. Whether those grounds be Windsor Park  or Derry City&rsquo;s Brandywell Stadium, there is no  money in the Budget for them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Scott Report of  1997 established that investment of &pound;30 million was required in order to  bring our sports grounds up to standard.  Inflation and increased standards have  now overtaken that figure, but, to date, the Govern&shy;ment have only  invested &pound;6&middot;3 million, through Sport Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As a result of historical failures of Government to invest  properly in sports grounds and the absence of funding in the Budget, grounds  will fail to meet the standards that The Safety of Sports Grounds (Northern Ireland)  Order 2006 and the Green Guide imposed. In order  to comply with statutory health and safety require&shy;ments, grounds will  be forced to reduce greatly their capacity, and, in other instances, they may  have to close down. That will have obvious implications for Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  ability to market itself as a region of sporting excellence. It will limit our  ability to host international sporting events, including our ability to host football matches during the London 2012  Olympic and Paralympic Games.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Under direct rule, &pound;53 million was set aside for centres of  excellence in the elite facilities programme. That programme is intended to  ensure that Northern Ireland  benefits from, and contributes to, the legacy of the London 2012 Olympic and  Paralympic Games. A target was set to  attract 10 international teams to Northern Ireland for acclimatisation and pre-Games training. That will involve building 10 new, world-class  sporting facilities and attracting world-class coaches and other  sports-related specialists to Northern    Ireland. However, the Budget reduces that  commitment from &pound;53 million to &pound;35 million,  and, out of that &pound;35 million, &pound;15 million has been committed to the  provision of a 50-metre swimming pool in north Down. That leaves only &pound;20  million to build the other 10 centres.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">From my discussions with Sport Northern Ireland, I  understand that there will be no money available for the construction of  community facilities between 2008 and 2011. If new or improved facilities are  to be made available locally, they will have to be built by the local  authorities, and the increased pressures on ratepayers will be significant.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Budget&rsquo;s allocation to sport falls short of the  requirements of the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure&rsquo;s draft sport  strategy. That will have a number of negative effects. We will not achieve the  target participation levels in sport across the demographic groups and will, therefore, miss opportunities to  improve health and well-being and to target social need at individual and community level. The people of Northern Ireland will fail to achieve the potential sports legacy  of the 2012 Olympic Games.  Furthermore, the international competitiveness of Northern Ireland  athletes will be disadvantaged.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister will be  aware that, during the consultation process on the draft Programme for  Government and the draft Budget, almost 50% of those who contributed talked  about the lack of money, funding and leadership in the arts and sports  fraternities. The allocation of &pound;1&middot;5 million to the arts is a minimal approach.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is an indictment of historical governance that the arts have fallen so far behind, compared to other  regions. The arts are considered important in the Republic  of Ireland, Scotland,  Wales and England. They  contribute to a region&rsquo;s attractiveness as a place to invest, and they contribute significantly and directly to the  economy through many creative industries and product design. That is why  Governments in Scotland and  the Republic of Ireland spend twice as much per capita  on the arts as we do. When will we invest properly in our historical and excellent culture? Why are we not doing so  already? We know what investment is required, so why are we not  investing in our own people and heritage, as other regions are doing?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Arts Council of Northern Ireland said that for an extra  &pound;10 million pounds a year, it could raise spending to a level similar to that  of the Republic of Ireland and Scotland. For that sum, the Arts  Council could have levered in additional millions of pounds and put the region  on the map. There was an opportunity to deliver that in the Programme for  Government. It has not happened in this Budget &mdash; we are still the poor  relation, and our performance will continue to be substandard and second-class.  It is not too late to change that situation, and I hope that in his review &mdash;  whatever its duration might be &mdash; the Minister will decide to make the required  and proper investment in all communities.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr F McCann: Go raibh maith agat. Although there has  been support from most of the parties for the Budget  and the departmental increases that the Executive has endorsed, Members  must keep their feet firmly on the ground. While the revised Budget appears to  have delivered the resources required for most Departments, it once again  highlights the serious deficiencies in the infrastructure inherited from direct  rule Ministers and shows up the  underinvestment that existed for many years.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Serious problems have been stored up for us in the area of  housing. In every survey that has been carried out on these islands, housing  has featured as one of the top three issues  of major concern. The serious problems in the housing sector are not a  new phenomenon; they have been with us for  many years. The lack of investment or any type of strategy to tackle the  housing crisis is an indictment of those direct rule Ministers who held the  relevant portfolio over the years.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr A Maginness: Will the Member give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr F McCann: No, I have not got enough time.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The housing crisis is real, and it affects everyone, from  the very young to the very old: those who have been priced out of ever owning a  home because the market was speculator-led,  which put the price of houses well out of their reach, and those who  have been on housing waiting lists for years with no hope of getting a house  because not enough social houses were being built. I am glad that the argument  about the Budget is coming to an end, because it is hiding a real question  about housing: how will we end the housing crisis? What strategy will be  brought before the Assembly that will lead us out of the nightmare?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although the Minister of Finance has said that there will  be increases in the Budget for the Department for Social Development to allow  the building of 1,500, 1,750 and 2,000 new, welcome, social houses over the  lifetime of the Budget, there is still a gap between what is required to deal  with the housing crisis and what is detailed in the Budget.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If we are to make a difference to &mdash; and an impact on &mdash; the ever-growing waiting list, at least &pound;200  million a year will be required for the foreseeable future. However,  that does not necessarily mean money from the Department of Finance. In fact,  the way is now clear for the Minister for Social Development to tell Members  what she will do. For months, she has hidden behind  the Budget and accused her Executive colleagues of not giving her the  necessary money. She cannot hide behind that excuse any longer, but must  explain how she will spend her departmental budget, in addition to providing  the House with information about the further measures that she will bring to  the table. There can now be no excuse for  not producing an effective strategy to provide the required housing. For  months, we have listened to the Minister  telling us how, given the money, she would deal with the housing crisis.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mrs M Bradley: Will the Member give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr F McCann: No. She has been given the money &mdash; let us  see what she can deliver. Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s, the DUP&rsquo;s and other parties&rsquo; Ministers &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Deputy Speaker, is  there any chance of some order?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Deputy Speaker: Order.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr F McCann: By providing the required finance, Sinn  F&eacute;in, DUP and other parties&rsquo; Ministers have delivered on their promises to  prioritise housing, and Margaret Ritchie signed off on that commitment. We  await the result of that commitment in the form of her action plan.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members must remember that 21,000 people a year declare  themselves homeless, and that rate has been growing each year. The stark  reality of the problem is that the waiting  list stands at upwards of 36,000 people.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Housing shortages are cross-cutting and impact on every  aspect of people&rsquo;s lives. Being homeless can affect people&rsquo;s mental well-being,  their employment prospects and their &mdash; and their children&rsquo;s &mdash; education  attainment. Having a home allows one to grow as a person and gives one the  dignity and confidence to build for the future.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Across the state, Members can see the legacy of previous  Administrations and the extent of the job that must be done. Department for  Social Development housing statistics from 2002-03 to 2006-07 show that 10,832  people have faced actions to repossess their houses because of mortgage  arrears.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">For the past several  years, the social-housing new-build programme has had little impact  throughout the North. Between 2004-05 and 2006-07, six new social houses were  built in Omagh; three were built in Magherafelt; none in Ballymoney; one in  Limavady; none in Moyle; 27 in Strabane; and five in Cookstown. Those are some  of the shocking statistics that illustrate the housing mess that we are in.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members must ask how they can make a difference for the  person who is sleeping on the street because he or she has nowhere to go; for  people who have been in hostels for years because too few houses are being  built; for people in private-rental accommodation that is unsuitable for their  needs and who are paying over the odds; for young people who cannot afford to  get a mortgage; or for couples whose mortgage payment accounts for two thirds  of their monthly income. Those are the realities that the Assembly must face,  but what is the solution?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">All Members share the responsibility of bringing our people  out of that crisis, and that is why it is crucial that the Minister for Social  Development brings her strategy to the table. We must know what has been done  in the eight months since she took office. What are the results and  recommendations from the review group&rsquo;s deliberations?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We argued that article 40 of The Planning Order 1991 should  have been tackled first and should have been a key element in providing a  steady flow of social and affordable houses. Is the Co-ownership Housing  Association to be the only option in the affordable-housing sector, or will the  Minister take on board the necessity of broadening the sector in order to allow  different approaches for different situations?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the provision of social-rented houses, can we expect, as  has been suggested, a wider remit for the private-rental sector &mdash; an  uncontrolled sector with few real restrictions on how business is conducted,  and which is paid huge amounts of money by the Govern&shy;ment? Has the Minister  approached the construction industry to ascertain how it can deliver, as it did  in England?  The benefits are twofold &mdash; the Assembly invests huge sums of money in various  projects, and the bartering of land for houses has been widely used. It will be  interesting to see what the Minister has done to encourage that industry to be  a partner in the provision of social and affordable housing.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That would also give a  much-needed lift to the wider community through the creation of new jobs  in a renewed construction sector.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In her press statement yesterday, the Minister said that  the Budget is much better than the original; it is better for those on waiting  lists, the homeless and those who want to reach the first rung on the ladder.  The time for talking is over &mdash; let us see what the Minister can deliver. Go  raibh maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr S Wilson: In case anyone interrupts me during my speech, I want to make it clear that I am not  speaking as the Chairperson of the Education Committee. I intend to be  totally partisan and party political and to address some of the issues that the  Alliance Party and SDLP have raised.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Some Members: Hear, hear.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr S Wilson: To avoid any unnecessary points of order  or interruptions, I want to make that clear from the start. The amendments &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Deputy Speaker: Order, order.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Dallat: On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. How  will Members know if Mr Sammy Wilson is being partisan?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr S Wilson: The Member will find out in a minute or  two. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Deputy Speaker: Order, order.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr McElduff: On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. Is  the Member minded to give way if an interesting point arises during his  remarks?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr S Wilson: Provided that time is added on, I am happy  to give way. Members will welcome that. I will examine the Alliance Party  amendment first. Members are used to  regarding the Alliance Party as the eccentric party, which almost  invites people to poke fun at it. However, Dr Farry excelled himself today;  when it comes to establishing the Alliance Party&rsquo;s role as a haven for political  crackpots or to developing the art of kamikaze politics, he has done his party  proud. Let us look at the Alliance Party&rsquo;s  policies for Northern    Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Cobain: Why does  the Member look at me when he says that?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr S Wilson: The Member is getting very close to the  Alliance Party. Dr Farry lamented that the Budget is a low-tax one &mdash; the message to taxpayers in Northern    Ireland is that, if they vote for the Alliance Party, they will have their  pockets picked through more tax. That is a great policy, and the electorate  will be very happy to vote on it at the next election. Dr Farry even took on  the CBI; although the CBI called for a reduction in business rates and provided  good justification for that, he says that it is the wrong direction to go in. Dr  Farry says the Government  should tax people and spend more.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The next remark, which the leader of the Alliance Party may  not have heard, was that farmers get too much &mdash; farmers in South   Antrim will not be pleased to hear that. All I ever hear is that  farmers do not get enough, and that they have a hard time. Those are the type  of groups that the Alliance Party will appeal to. The Alliance Party wants to  get its hands deeper into taxpayers&rsquo; pockets and cut the Budget allocation to  farmers. Its representatives then have the cheek to say that they want to spend  more money in 15 areas such as health, the arts, sport, public transport and  the environment. However, they do not want any assets to be sold to facilitate  that. The Assembly does not have any  tax-raising powers, and Mr Ford may want to address that later. Perhaps  he wants income tax powers here, as well. To finance that spending wish list  without selling assets, we will have to dip into ratepayers&rsquo; pockets.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members have had only a ten-minute glimpse of the Alliance  Party&rsquo;s economic strategy. After hearing from the both the Alliance Party and  the Minister of Finance and Personnel, I guarantee that the voters of Northern Ireland  have not been left with much of a choice.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It will be very easy to  see which Budget the electorate will vote for &mdash; and it will not be for  Alliance voodoo economics, but for the real compromises that have been found in  the Budget process by the Minister of Finance and Personnel.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I now move to the SDLP amendment. It is clear that the SDLP  is embarrassed about its stance. When I have done wrong by somebody, it is  usually by damning them with faint praise. I notice that when the Member for  North Antrim Mr O&rsquo;Loan was making his speech, he did the same by making six  references to the great job that Margaret Ritchie had done &mdash; before adding, as  an afterthought, that he was going to vote against everything that she had  talked about, agreed, and voted for in the Budget process. The SDLP did the  same to her yesterday.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I went through the Lobby with the Minister last night, and  she looked rather forlorn. I could have been wrong, but I thought that I heard  her mournfully humming the tune to the words, &ldquo;Sometimes it&rsquo;s hard to be a  woman&rdquo;. I have to say that given the type of leader she has, it must be very  hard. She was rather more cheerful this morning, mind you &mdash; she must have been  singing that Cliff Richard song, &ldquo;We Don&rsquo;t Talk Anymore&rdquo; as she was walking  down the corridors.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I heard the SDLP leader defending the Minister on the radio  this morning, and I was wondering whether he should be called &ldquo;Brutus&rdquo; Durkan  rather than Mark Durkan because it did not  seem to be much of a defence. Yesterday, the SDLP praised the Minister  but lamented that there was not enough money for social enterprise and  voluntary groups. Most of the finance for that comes from the Department for  Social Development, therefore the Minister  must not have fought hard enough for funding. I know that the SDLP has  to find some excuse, now that it has decided to be in Government and in opposition.  However, today its amendment talks about there being no budgetary line for key  policy developments including an anti-poverty strategy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The leader of the SDLP, who has also been Minister of  Finance and Personnel, knows full well that one cannot have a budgetary line  relating to an anti-poverty strategy because such a strategy embraces a number  of Departments. It embraces the Department for Social Development, as regards  fuel poverty, the warm homes scheme, and  the actions being taken on urban regeneration and in deprived areas. It  also embraces the Department of Education as regards early-years provision and  the extended schools programme. It embraces  the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment, which is trying to  get people back into work &mdash; surely the best way to get people out of poverty.  It will embrace the Department for Employment and Learning, which is helping to  train people who are finding it difficult to get work in order to get them on  the route to a job. There is not going to be an anti-poverty line.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Durkan: I do not see an anti-poverty strategy  either.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr S Wilson: I hear the Member speaking from a sedentary position. The work will be  cross-departmental. All of the things that I have mentioned are being  financed by the Budget and have been included in the Programme for Government.  It is a fairly weak and transparent argument to say that, just because one  doesn&rsquo;t see something, it must not exist. I do not think that that message has  gotten across to the rest of the SDLP &mdash; and I do not want to embarrass the  party&rsquo;s education spokesman, who is sitting behind his leader.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Some Members: Go on.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr S Wilson: OK, I will.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">SDLP Members lament that there has been an abandonment of  cross-cutting funds for young people; for example, the children&rsquo;s fund. That  was a fund that one could delve into, and make funding applications for, and  get money for programmes that lasted two or there years &mdash; and then when that  time was over, the programmes fell flat, and there was no continuity.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the Education Committee, the SDLP &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I see that the Minister for Social Development has entered  the Chamber &mdash; she must have heard me talking about her. Let me assure the  Minister that I was saying nice things about her and upbraiding those cruel people who have abandoned her. I do not know  whether she has her arms around her colleagues&rsquo; shoulders or around  their necks. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the Education Committee, the SDLP supported other  members of the Committee&rsquo;s view that the kind of one-off funds for programmes  that last two or three years and are then  abandoned when they are just starting to work are not the best use of  financial resources. It is better to mainstream much of that money, and that is  exactly what the Budget seeks to do. Rather than using those other means of expenditure, the money is put into  mainstream Departments so that they can plan, project and ensure continuity.  For those reasons, I support the Budget and oppose the amendment.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Deputy Speaker: The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members, in case you are not quite sure, Mr Wilson was not  speaking as Chairperson of the Committee for Education.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n: Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle.  I notice that you did not give Sammy Wilson extra time for being entertaining,  Mr Deputy Speaker. He needed it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in supports the Budget and does not support the  amendments. Our response to the Budget is not, and cannot be, made in isolation  from the political and financial realities that confront the Executive and the  Assembly. We welcomed the debate yesterday on the Programme for Government and  the ISNI strategy, and the watchwords for all of the Executive&rsquo;s policies have  been, and will continue to be, &ldquo;fairness&rdquo;, &ldquo;inclusion&rdquo; and &ldquo;equality&rdquo;.  Notwithstanding, there are a number of major obstacles to the progressive  development and delivery by the Executive of a new social, economic and  political reality.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">At an overarching  level, Sinn F&eacute;in believes that there must be a redistributive dynamic in  the Executive&rsquo;s financial and political policies that recognises that economic  sovereignty, economic prosperity and economic equality are all linked. It is a  collective responsibility. A united response from all the political parties to the economic realities and financial  limitations that confront us will have much more effect on the national  and international stage than narrow political posturing.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in has a number of concerns, but that will not stop  it endorsing the Budget today. It will not support PFI/PPP arrangements in  education and healthcare. Private partners can have no say in the management of  schools and hospitals, and they have no power to affect levels of  public-service provision. All employees of PFI/PPP projects should be retained  in the public sector and civil servants instructed to find appropriate ways of  achieving that &mdash; for example, by defining them as &ldquo;clinical staff&rdquo;. All PFI/PPP  contractors must comply fully with the legislation and promote equality. Sinn  F&eacute;in has insisted on the fullest and deepest application of the section 75  equality duty by the Executive in relation to any of those projects.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Currently, the community and voluntary sector is starved of  funding. That difficulty is exacerbated by many groups having to wait on  decisions about Peace III funding, with no alternative measures to sustain  their projects, even though those have been central to delivering opportunities  for community health programmes, training and development, education, an the promotion of good relations and initiatives for  children and young people.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The ongoing grief and  trauma experienced by survivors and victims of political violence must  be recognised and resourced on an equal and equitable basis. That is  particularly important in relation to addressing the legacy of the conflict through inter- and intra-community  initiatives. Yesterday, we heard about the funds that will be allocated to  victims&rsquo; and survivors&rsquo; groups for services and support. That is most welcome.  All members of the Executive must be imaginative and creative about resourcing  and retaining the skills and expertise that have been acquired in the community  and voluntary sector and that have helped to promote and sustain citizenship  and peace. That contribution must not go unnoticed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The health budget, in particular, has been the subject of  much debate. As stated previously, we are faced with a number of financial  realities and constraints. We highlighted that the health and social-care  provision, which suffered from underinvestment for decades under successive  British direct rule Administrations, must be challenged.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Health Minister has challenges ahead, as do all Ministers. Those challenges must be met in a  constructive and innovative manner in partnership with patients, health  professionals and trade-union representatives.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I welcome the additional money that the Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety will receive, particularly the  priority given to additional resources by monitoring rounds.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in will support further investment in the Health Service throughout the lifetime of the  Executive. Such investment must target front-line services, including  community and primary-care services, and not just acute services.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The health profile of  those in the North is a disgrace. Discrimination, poverty and social  exclusion are the legacy of consecutive  British direct rule Administrations.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mrs D Kelly: Will the Member give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n: No, I will not.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">To bring an end to unacceptably poor health statistics, we  must reach a balance in how we invest in, and deal with, ill health, and how we  invest in the eradication of social and  economic issues that cause so much ill health.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Durkan: Go with the flow.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n: The long-term improvement in the  population&rsquo;s health can be achieved only by tackling the root causes of  discrimination, poverty and social exclusion, and that must be done. Sinn F&eacute;in  calls on all Departments to set about ensuring that investment for health  becomes the cornerstone of their work. Failure to do so will condemn future  generations to a continuing environment of ill health.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Health is an area of co-operation under the Good Friday  Agreement. It is intended that all people should benefit, and that co-operation  should be exploited to its maximum potential, especially in those communities  that straddle the border.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There must be ongoing  commitment in the Assembly and the Executive to delivering equality,  above the European and domestic legal requirements, for those with  disabilities.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mrs D Kelly: Will the Member give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n: No, the Member will not.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">One in five people in the North has some form of  disability, and one in four families is directly affected by disability. Sinn F&eacute;in will continue to demand  equitable health service provision  across the full range of services.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">All areas of the health service are worthy of mention;  however, we wish to emphasise a few. Sinn F&eacute;in supports the full implementation  of the Bamford Review for Mental Health and Learning Difficulties. Sinn F&eacute;in  has consistently called for proper funding for suicide awareness, alongside  proper family and community support in those services.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is time that the role of carers in our society was  recognised, and Sinn F&eacute;in welcomes the action that has been taken; however, we  must all do more. There is an urgent and compelling case for the development of  North-West cross-border cancer care, and for a radiotherapy facility to be  established in conjunction with the Department of Health and Children.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in will continue to engage with the various health sectors and, through membership of the  Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety, to demand  delivery of those services.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in secured the commitment on language for equality,  and, specifically, the commitment to allocate resources, which will now be  based on the outcome of equality impact assessment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in has written equality into the heart of not only  the Programme for Government investment strategy but into the Budget. While  others grandstand and play juvenile party politics, when they step away from  the demands of political leadership, we have secured demands that can be seen  in this and future Budgets. I support the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr McQuillan: It is with great pleasure that I support  the Budget. The last year was one of historic proportions, and the delivery of  a Budget that targets Northern Ireland&rsquo;s most important and historically  underfunded sectors in receipt of public finances &mdash; and by a Northern Ireland  Finance Minister &mdash; should not be underestimated.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Funding has always been,  and always will be, required for public sector services, and, in Northern Ireland,  the priorities were never fully recognised under direct rule. We now have  tangible proof that locally elected politicians understand the people that they  represent and their priorities. An extensive commitment to social housing; the  freezing of the regional rate; new water mains and sewerage systems; funding to  attract and encourage new business in Northern Ireland; 13 new trains and 200 new buses are only some of the  priorities identified, and only some of what has been achieved in the  eight months since devolution. What makes that more incredible is the fact that  it has been achieved by a four-party Executive.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">No Minister has been given all of the funding he or she  desired. That will never happen, because the Executive pot has a bottom and, no  matter how the Finance Minister may try, he cannot make money appear that does  not exist &mdash; although I am sure that he wishes he could. The Budget, therefore,  entails the Minister&rsquo;s having to do his very best with the funding at his  disposal. That means that every penny spent must produce more, as well as  greater savings being made in Departments.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">This Budget will result in businesses receiving more  encouragement to establish in Northern    Ireland, which will be of immense benefit to  people who are not presently working &mdash; a situation that is relevant to my own  constituency.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Funding for rural transport will ensure that services will  be maintained for those who live in country areas of Northern Ireland. However, the  biggest impact for rural residents, especially the older population, will be  felt in the lowering of the eligible age for free public transport to 60 years  of age. Those are most important steps in ensuring that rural populations do  not suffer social exclusion due to poor access to public transport and lower  incomes that restrict their ability to use the transport that is available.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The welcome announcement of additional funding for social  housing covers rural and urban areas. That is a most encouraging start in  making sure that all who need a home will have one. It will take time to  achieve that aim, but the money that the Minister of Finance and Personnel has  allocated is a great start.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I congratulate the Minister of Finance and Personnel on  achieving so much with so little. The Assembly is delivering for the people of Northern Ireland,  and I hope that the Budget will be unanimously supported by all Members.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">The Chairperson of the Committee for Regional  Development (Mr Cobain): The Committee for Regional Development, like other  Committees, has spent considerable time discussing the Budget over the past few  months. On behalf of the Committee for Regional Development, I thank all those  individuals and stakeholder organisations who generously placed their time and expertise at the disposal of the  Committee during its deliberations.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">With the exception of &pound;40 million in additional funding for  roads investment in year three, the final departmental budget remains largely  unchanged from the levels that were allocated in the draft Budget stage. The  development allocation for the Department in the final Budget remains  insufficient to meet the infra&shy;structural, economic, social and environmental  needs of Northern Ireland. </p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The allocations for structural maintenance in the Budget  period are &pound;125 million short of the &pound;110 million per annum identified in the  structural maintenance funding plan. The Committee is concerned about the road  safety consequences of continued underfunding in that area. Those risks were  highlighted in the most recent Roads Service annual report and accounts.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee&rsquo;s view is that supplementing inadequate  Budget allocations with bids from in-year monitoring is not a viable long-term  strategy for funding structural maintenance programmes, although funding from  any source is welcome. The Committee will be urging for additional funding for  structural roads maintenance through the in-year monitoring process and through  future Budget rounds. Investment in road infrastructures is essential to the  social and economic well-being of Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A good quality road network is crucial to improving journey  times in Northern Ireland,  connectivity to and from our ports and airports, and facilitating business, tourism and balanced regional development. In  addition, a substantial amount of our public transport is road-based, and access to health and social services,  employ&shy;ment, education and training and cultural and sporting activities  depend on an adequate, sustainable, safe and effective roads network.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee remains concerned that the final Budget  allocation of &pound;608 million for roads capital is significantly below the &ldquo;low  scenario&rdquo; of &pound;1 billion in year one to year three in the draft investment  strategy programme. The Committee notes that a welcome addition of &pound;40 million  has been allocated in year three of the Budget period, allowing Roads Service  to progress a number of schemes in that year. However, the Committee will continue to press for increased roads  allocations in light of the importance of connectivity and free-flowing road  networks to continued economic development in Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Like roads infrastructure, a good-quality integrated  network of bus and rail transport services is a key element in underpinning  economic development and access to education, employment, leisure and social  services. Investment in public transport also brings environmental benefits in  the form of reduced carbon emissions and  reduced landscape, air and noise pollution. </p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Investment in buses and  trains in recent years has made public  transport a more attractive option, and has helped generate an increase  in passenger journeys. However, there has  been a persistent underspend in public transport infrastructure in the  past. In addition, less than half of the public-transport bids that were  submitted were successful in the final Budget, despite the fact that we heard  support in the House last week from all parties for increased funding for the  public-transport network.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee is determined to address a number of other  issues. Members are aware that provision for preparatory work on the Belfast to Londonderry  rail line has been made in the Budget. The Committee recommends that urgent  action be undertaken on that line as soon as possible. The Committee is also  keen to see the extension of concessionary fares to people with a disability  and those returning to work after a period of long-term unemployment; improved  provision for those with disabilities, especially those in rural areas, in accessing concessionary fares or free public  transport; and hourly bus services in more of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s towns and  villages.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee will continue to press for additional funding  for public transport, including rural transport services.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I turn to environmental concerns. There is little evidence  of the radical rethink of polices that is needed to deliver the 60% to 80% reduction in carbon emissions by 2050,  which was the target identified by the Prime Minister in his speech of 19  November 2007. Given the impact of public and private transport on levels of  carbon emissions and on air, environmental and noise pollution, the Committee  is worried that DRD&rsquo;s role in that area has not been recognised at all in the  Budget.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department is  finalising plans to deliver efficiency savings of &pound;22 million, &pound;44  million and &pound;65 million over the three-year Budget period. The Committee&rsquo;s view  is that efficiencies must not be achieved at the expense of public services,  public and road safety, and progress on planned infrastructural investments.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, the Executive have yet to make a number of  decisions on the outstanding issues that arose from strand one of the review  report by the Independent Water Review Panel, as well as those that arose from strand two. Those issues include: the level of  efficiency targets and their  achievability; the level of the affordability tariff and its tenure; the  financing of Northern Ireland Water; the funding of roads drainage; and the  partial waiver of the dividend. The budgetary implications of those decisions  should not fall to DRD&rsquo;s budget, but should be funded directly by the  Executive.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to make a few  personal points. I want to reiterate my strong opposition to the way in  which rates and water charges are being  handled. In his Budget statement of  last week, the Minister of Finance and Personnel said:</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;Let those who say that devolution makes no difference  explain that logic to the average household, which will be &pound;1,000 better off  than it would have been if direct rule had continued.&rdquo; &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Official  Report, Vol 26, No 7, p314, col 1].</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I can tell the Minister that tens of thousands of  pensioners, working poor, near-benefit-level families, and people with disabilities who rely mainly on benefits will  have to pay a water tax for the first time, and they will certainly not be  &pound;1,000 better off. The new tax will have a substantial and damaging impact on  their already fragile living standards.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, at the same time, we are faced with the unedifying  spectacle of an affordability tariff for the rich, such that millionaires whose  homes are worth over &pound;400,000 will get their rates and water charges subsidised  by the poor. Thus, the poor will pay more, and the rich will pay less than they  should. It is disgraceful and obscene that burdens are being lifted from those  who are best able to pay, while heavier burdens are being placed on the poor,  who are least able to pay. That is morally  and politically reprehensible. We are witnessing Thatcherism reborn,  whereby the rich get richer and the poor get poorer, and that is opening up  deep social inequalities that have never properly healed. Those measures are  being carried out under the guise of being business friendly, but that is no  excuse. The Assembly must also be about social justice. The transformation of  our society will never be achieved by exploiting and disregarding the poor and  the less well off.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The new water tax will have knock-on effects. The list of  those in need of social housing grows ever longer.  Although I welcome the additional &pound;205 million that the Minister for  Social Development received in the revised  allocation that the Finance Minister announced last week, I must sound a note of caution. That additional money  is insufficient to meet the growing demand. The targets set by Sir John Semple in his review of affordable  housing of 2,000 new social homes a year will not be met. In year 1, the target  in the Budget is 500 short, in year 2, it is 250 short, and it reaches the  Semple review level only in year 3.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">How can the Executive claim that they subscribe to the  targets set by Semple, particularly given that the Minister confirmed yesterday  that there are currently 38,000 people who are classified as being in housing  need, of which 21,000 are officially classified as homeless? Those figures will  be further exacerbated by the introduction of a water tax. Many of the tenants  in the private sector are already subsidising their housing benefit in order to  pay their rent.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Any further increases in the form of a water tax will pass  directly from the landlord to the tenant by way of a rent increase. There is  little doubt that the figures quoted by the Minister yesterday can only  increase and exacerbate an already desperate housing situation.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr A Maginness: I was surprised by the Finance  Minister&rsquo;s brutal honesty, but shocked by his statement that when he was a Minister during the previous mandate, his aim,  and that of his DUP colleagues, was to bring down the Northern Ireland  Executive and ensure its destruction. He  clearly revelled in that most reprehensible strategy, and it is alarming  that the DUP adopted such an approach at that time.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, Members are grateful that he has been so blunt and  honest. The SDLP has been accused of attacking,  or undermining, the Executive, but it supports the political  architecture of the Executive and the Assembly and will fight to maintain it.  The SDLP is a member of the Executive as of right and agreed to a system of  government in which everyone shares power. The SDLP will not be marginalised in  any Executive: it will share power with everyone else, but will not be excluded  from power by two parties that want to steamroll and press-gang the Ulster  Unionists and the SDLP into a minority role, in which they will have virtually  no say.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP will continue to fight for the rights of ordinary  people in society. That is why the SDLP is opposed to the Budget, has tabled an  amendment and is an honest party. The Back-Benchers in Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP have rolled over and accepted the  Budget, but the SDLP rejects it. It is not a people&rsquo;s Budget; it is a  Thatcherite Budget. The Finance Minister is aware that Margaret Ritchie made  that perfectly clear to the Executive when they were discussing the Budget.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr P Robinson: If members of the SDLP were beating their chests in the way the Member now  describes, will he please explain to the House why its Minister did not  put to the Executive any of the proposals that the SDLP says are essential? Why  was there not a single amendment?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr A Maginness:  Perhaps the Finance Minister does not understand that there are two &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mrs I Robinson: Perhaps if the Member were to speak in  French &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr A Maginness: The Member must wait for a moment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are two elements to this political set-up: the  Executive and the Assembly. During the debate on the draft Budget, I said that  the DUP, and indeed some Sinn F&eacute;in Members, wanted to turn the Assembly into  the Supreme Soviet. It now appears that the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in want to turn the  Executive into the politburo, because they want neither discussion nor dissent.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP will maintain its independent line in the Executive and the Assembly. As a party in the  Assembly, the SDLP will not be bound by the dictates of Peter Robinson  or anyone else in the Executive.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr P Robinson: Did  the SDLP table an amendment?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Durkan: The SDLP did table an amendment.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr P Robinson: The SDLP has not tabled an amendment.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Deputy Speaker:  Order. Continue, Mr Maginness.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr A Maginness: I am sorry, Peter, get some therapy in  relation to all of this.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Deputy Speaker: Order. The Member should address his  remarks through the Chair.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr P Robinson: On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker.  I ask that the Member withdraw his remark. If he does not, Mr Deputy Speaker, I  ask you to consider the issue. It is up to you whether you do it now or whether  the Speaker does it. That remark has to be withdrawn, or the Member should be  withdrawn.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Deputy Speaker: I was calling &ldquo;Order&rdquo;, so I did not  hear the remark. I will check Hansard and refer the matter to the Speaker, who  will make a ruling at a later date.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr A Maginness: As I was saying, perhaps the Minister  of Finance and Personnel does not understand that this is a democratic Assembly  in which Members discuss and debate issues. I know that members of Sinn F&eacute;in do  not take any interventions during their speeches, but this Assembly is a  democratic institution in which Members  debate things and table amendments. Members should not be shocked by  amendments. Minister Ritchie expressed the SDLP&rsquo;s reservations at the Executive  meeting, as Mr Robinson well knows. Therefore, nothing comes as a shock or a  surprise to the Minister of Finance, any other Minister, or, indeed, any Member  of the Assembly. We have clearly stated our position throughout this process.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">On one hand, the  Minister prides himself on receiving all sorts of submissions from the  public asking about all sorts of changes to  the draft Budget. However, when the  SDLP makes reasonable propositions and reasonable criticisms of the  draft Budget, they are dismissed. He says that we should not suggest such  changes.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr S Wilson: Will the Member give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr A Maginness: I will. However, I hope that I get more  time.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr S Wilson: I hope that you do. If these amendments  are serious &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr A Maginness: I have to finish.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Deputy Speaker: Order. The Member refused to give  way. Extra time is granted only when the speech is of five minutes or less. Any  speech over that length gets exactly the time that has been given, which in  this case is 10 minutes.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr A Maginness: I hope that I am given extra time  because of all the interruptions.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">This is clearly not a  people&rsquo;s Budget. It is a Thatcherite Budget. It is clear that no  provision has been made for the children&rsquo;s fund. Incidentally, it is  interesting to read Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s submission on the draft Budget, which calls for  an Executive fund for children. There is silence from Sinn F&eacute;in today on that  issue. The SDLP is backing that call. Why does Sinn F&eacute;in not come into the  Lobby with us and back us on that issue?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are no clear lines  of funding for an anti-poverty strategy. We have heard about  post-primary education; however, the Budget makes no provision for that. The  present Minister of Education &mdash; I emphasise the &ldquo;present&rdquo; &mdash; has said that  post-primary education is cost-neutral. I want to see her assessments of that.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr D Bradley: I thank the Member for giving way. The Member  will recall that on 4 December 2007 the Minister of Education announced that: </p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;We now have an opportunity to truly transform our  system into one that is world class and fit for the twenty-first century.&rdquo; &mdash; <span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; ">[Offical  Report, Vol 26, No.1, p7, col 2].</span></span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">As the Member has said, and, indeed, as the  Minister of Finance has said, those reforms  are to be cost-neutral. However, the three-year Budget does not provide  any line for key policy developments, including the reform of post-primary  education. Does the Member agree that it is difficult to build an education  system that is world class and fit for the twenty-first century when the money  is not available to do so, and when it was not even bid for?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr A Maginness: I agree entirely. I also agree with Mr  Cobain that there is no clarity on water charging in the Budget. What is being  planned? A water tax is being planned. They are going to sneak it through,  despite all of the protests from the Sinn F&eacute;in Benches. Sinn F&eacute;in will simply  bow down and accept that, because they are pushovers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Finance Minister has provided money for social and affordable housing, but it is not enough. As  Mr Cobain rightly pointed out, the  Semple targets will not be reached, because  the Minister has not provided sufficient funding. There has been a good  improvement, but not good enough.</p>
	      <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Molloy] in the Chair)</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There has been much talk about asset disposal, but too many  eggs are being placed in one basket. What will happen if the bottom falls out  of the market, or if the international volatility continues and the entire  strategy is undermined?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">The Chairperson of the Committee for Health, Social  Services and Public Safety (Mrs I Robinson): I am going to be rather boring and  mundane, because I shall stick to health issues. I do not apologise for that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The proportion of overall Executive expenditure on health  and social care is highlighted in the Budget, and the Health Committee concurs  with the view that one of the most significant issues facing the present and  future Executives will be the priority that should be given to health and  social services, compared to other public services. </p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Health Committee devoted considerable time and energy  over a five-week period to examining the proposals in the draft Budget in some  detail. In addition to departmental officials and the Minister, the Committee  took evidence from represent&shy;atives of the four health and social services  boards, and the Mental Health and Learning Disability Board. The Committee  recognises that the achievement of significant efficiency savings by the  Department is absolutely essential if it is to be able to provide vital health  and social-care services.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee welcomed an unequivocal commitment by the  Minister that he will deliver those efficiencies and meet the target of &pound;343  million over the next three years. The Committee expressed very serious  concerns about the ongoing delay in reaching a decision on the new structures that  will replace boards as set out under the review of public administration. That  is causing uncertainty, frustration and a loss of morale among existing staff,  as well as absorbing valuable resources that should be directed to other key service developments. However, I welcome  yesterday&rsquo;s indication from the Minister that a decision on the way  forward is imminent.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee concluded that, even allowing for any  increased efficiencies above the required 3%, the outcome of the draft Budget  would not enable the Department to implement some much-needed new service  developments. In particular, the Committee reaffirmed  its total commitment to seeing the recommend&shy;ations of the Bamford  Review into mental health and learning  disability implemented in full and without delay.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, the Committee wholeheartedly welcomes the extra  funding for health that was announced in the Budget statement last week. That  additional funding has the clear potential to make a very significant  difference over the next three years, but it must be used efficiently and  appropriately.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">An additional &pound;10 million per year was allocated in response to strong views expressed during the  consultation period about the need for extra resources for mental-health  and learning-disability services. However, as the Minister of Finance and  Personnel made clear during his statement, it is a matter for the Minister of  Health, Public Services and Public Safety  how that will be used.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee welcomes the indication from the Department through a statement and a press release  that:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;an extra &pound;50 million for mental health and learning  disability will double the resettlement of long-stay patients, double the  previous provision for community mental health teams and significantly improve  respite for carers&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">However, the Committee calls for that money to be ring-fenced specifically for mental-health and  learning-disability services. That will not only provide an assurance of  the priority being given to mental-health and learning-disability services to  those working in that field, but would ensure that the money could not be  diverted when pressures arise in other areas, as has happened so often in the  past.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Health Committee also took evidence earlier this month  from Professor John Appleby, Chief Economist at the King&rsquo;s Fund in London.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Professor Appleby, who carried out an independent review of  health and social care in Northern Ireland in 2005, highlighted areas where the  Health Service here is much less efficient than in other parts of the United  Kingdom. He said:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;In 2005, we found almost 20% lower output per staff  than the UK average &mdash; that is nearly a fifth. &hellip;We looked at  hospital activity per bed and found  that that was around 26% lower than in England.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">4.00 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I mentioned earlier the significant efficiency savings that  the Department will have to make over the coming three years just to reach the  required 3% level. In its report on the draft Budget, the Committee concluded  that there may well be scope for further efficiency savings above the required  3%, and it had sought an assurance that the Department would be able to retain  any additional savings achieved in that way. The Committee is pleased to note  the announcement last week by the Minister of Finance and Personnel that the  Health Service will be able to retain any further efficiencies that it can  deliver beyond the existing 3% target for  immediate reinvestment into front-line services to patients.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I will conclude on behalf of the Committee by saying that  the draft Budget has now been decided for the next three years. The Minister  and the Department must deliver an efficient and effective health and social  care service, and the Committee will continue to play its part.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I will turn now to more party-political matters. Some  people have mischievously tried to claim that I, the DUP health spokesperson,  did not want to see further resources  directed towards health &mdash; a ludicrous allegation. Clearly, that is not  true. Believe me, there is no limit to the sums that I would devote to health,  were they available. I welcome every extra penny added on since the draft  Budget was presented.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is much more to  ensuring a good Health Service than  the sums allocated. Productivity and what the public gets out for the  money that it puts in are essential. Resources must be put to the most  effective use. It is unrealistic to expect  more and more money to be ploughed in endlessly, with double-digit  percentage increases in Budget after Budget. In order to illustrate that point,  the funding proposed for health over the three-year period is more than twice  that provided by the previous Executive.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We will always be able to use more money, but we must ensure that performance and productivity  improve. The recent Wanless review report confirmed that, despite  massive investment year on year, the same failings of the NHS persist across  the water. It is only by promoting innovation and increasing productivity that  progress can be made. That is why there was such frustration at the lack of movement on the RPA reforms. Thankfully, we can at last look forward to some  progress, with the news of a ministerial statement next week.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Local commissioning groups, comprising general  practitioners and other health professionals, have been in place since  February. Individuals have agreed to give up their time to serve their local  communities, and they have the opportunity to improve and influence services in  their areas. They must be permitted to get on with that work without further  delay.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Incentives must be introduced to maximise perfor&shy;mance,  outcomes and cost-effectiveness. Inefficiency and  inertia must be driven out. Merely meeting efficiency targets may get us  through the next couple of years, but without reform, the Health Service will  be in little better shape in three years&rsquo; time, come the next comprehensive  spending review. Overhauling the way in  which we commission services is vital. The formation of a single health  authority is about much more than a simple matter of rationalisation. The most  important consequences concern performance management and the financial  management of health services across the Province.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The single health authority was to be the commiss&shy;ioning  organiser, maintaining the local commissioning groups, and itself commissioning  regional services &mdash; a single bureaucracy to  support local groups and reduce duplication. Its performance-management  role would be the key to holding local commissioning groups and trusts to account &mdash; something sadly lacking,  previously.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The average cost of prescription items is 10&middot;3% higher in Northern Ireland  than across the water. The number of administrators here has increased by 37%  since 1997. Those are examples of issues that we can begin to tackle.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mahatma Gandhi said:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;It is health that is real wealth and not pieces of  gold and silver.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">An investment in health is an investment in the  very heart of the nation, and the additional &pound;10 million year on year for the  next three years is very welcome. How the Executive balance the needs of health  and social services with the other public services will demonstrate their  maturity and wisdom. Those decisions will demonstrate that we understand that  health is a foundation stone in the building of a new society in Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As the Royal College of Psychiatrists states, there is no  health without mental health. Mental health is an important area of need, and  we must reassure the public that the additional funds, when taken with the 3%  efficiency savings that are to be made, will not result in any decrease in service delivery. Even though the elderly  population is increasing, mortality rates are decreasing, so attention must be  paid to the mental-health needs of those who are aged over 65. Conditions such  as Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease and dementia have a significant effect on the quality of  life of people in that age group and on the health of their carers. Hopefully,  the Minister will reassure us that any moneys that are released from efficiency  savings in the mental-health sector will not only remain in that sector, but  will be age blind.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Deputy Speaker: The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Lunn: I oppose the Budget, as it has been presented, and I support the Alliance Party&rsquo;s  amendment. Mr Weir is not in the Chamber, but if I sound like a stuck  record, so be it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The issues of tackling sectarianism and segregation,  rebalancing the economy and delivering integrated and sustainable public  services apply not only to the Government&rsquo;s policy programme but to the funding  that they allocate to it. The Alliance Party opposed the Programme for  Government, and it opposes the Budget on the basis that neither tackles those  issues head on.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We are sorry that the debate has degenerated, at times,  into one where the Minister of Finance and Personnel and others have chosen to  lambaste parties rather than arguments. In a democracy, there is nothing wrong  with dissent or discussion. There is nothing wrong with debate &mdash; even angry  debate &mdash; but the focus should be on issues, not on personalities or parties. At the start of the debate, the Minister  graciously gave us permission to oppose the motion. Our dissent will not  be stifled when we feel that it is appropriate &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr P Robinson: I did not give you permission to oppose  the Budget; I supported your right to do so.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Lunn: All right. I do not know whether that was an  intervention.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In its opposition to the  Budget,&nbsp; the Alliance Party would gladly  have considered building consensus with the SDLP. I congratulate that party for  tabling an amendment that is even more complex than ours. However, in this  context &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Durkan: It is more precise.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Lunn: It is more precise, if the Member prefers that  terminology.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Declan O&rsquo;Loan&rsquo;s remarks  this morning were somewhat unfortunate. Given that we agree with much of  the SDLP&rsquo;s amendment, we would have been prepared to have given that party the  benefit of the doubt, despite feeling that its amendment misses the main  points. It does not refer to the cost of division or to a shared future. That  omission is surely not accidental, as it would have made the SDLP amendment  almost indistinguishable from ours.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Turning to tackling division, we come to education. The DUP  has a democratic mandate, fairly won, to lead the Executive. The Executive have  presented a Programme for Government that is committed to a thriving  Irish-medium sector. Therefore, the Budget should be committed to funding that  sector. Irish-medium club banks provide the best way to achieve that; that is  why we voted in favour of them. However, our preference is for integrated  education through the medium of Irish where demand exists.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr D Bradley: Will the Member give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Lunn: Certainly. I think that I had better.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr D Bradley: It is my understanding that the Minister  of Education has now rejected Irish-medium club banks. However, the  Irish-language film fund has not been catered for in the Budget. Does the  Member agree that the money that has already been invested in that project will  be wasted unless it is followed up with further investment and resources?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Lunn: I thank the Member; he knows more about the Minister&rsquo;s thoughts than I do. I do not  disagree with him.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Integrated education is the preferable way forward, and it  is a matter of public record that we support Irish-medium education where there  is demand for it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, it is a pity that the Executive&rsquo;s new-found  commitment to a shared future remains firmly in quotation marks. That  commitment is not matched by funding to deliver a thriving integrated sector  and more places in integrated schools, in line with parental demand.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My party is more ambitious than that. The integration of  our society should start at the point at which parents demand &mdash; as early as  possible in life. Funding must match that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I turn to the arts &mdash; an  area in which cross-community projects occur effortlessly. However,  because the arts received no uplift at all in the draft Budget, Members should  not be surprised that that sector was so vocal during the response process.  Another &pound;2 million has been found for the arts, and that is a step in the right  direction. However, it remains a very small step. That will leave funding for  the arts still below &pound;7&middot;50 a head, and that compares with &pound;12 a head in each of  the neighbouring jurisdictions.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, on the issue of tackling divisions, the Budget  includes commitments to efficiencies. Those are welcome insofar as they match Great Britain&rsquo;s,  but, if the Executive are to freeze rates, the Budget must go further.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister said earlier that he had invited the Alliance  Party to talk to him about some of those matters. We would be more than  prepared to do that. Mr Weir and Mr Beggs both asked for more meat on the bones  of our suggestions. However, we produced a 19-page response to the draft Budget  during the consultation period, and I see nothing of that in the final  document. However, we made our presentation, and we are prepared to take up the  Minister&rsquo;s offer to talk to him at any time.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My colleague Stephen Farry appropriately outlined the  Alliance Party&rsquo;s difficulty with the Budget&rsquo;s underlying economic policy. Let  me be clear: we have nothing against low taxes. We fought an election campaign  offering lower rates bills, but we specified that we would bring them about by  making savings based on reducing the costs of division. The Budget is not  committed to that, not even in the long term. We want to match low taxes with  balanced investment, to deliver better services to indigenous businesses and to  deliver better public services and an improved quality of life that will make  Northern Ireland a much better place in which to invest. The Alliance Party is  not alone in that. The Confederation of British Industry and the Economic  Research Institute of Northern Ireland, scarcely known for advocating high  taxes, are entirely at one with us on those matters.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">On public services, I have already outlined areas of  education and culture that can deliver a society that is committed to ending  the divisions that sadly define it. It is noteworthy, with respect to  education, that area planning is an essential part of delivering money to  pupils, not buildings. That means not just integration along religious lines,  but shared facilities.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">On health, most of all, we were disappointed that the bid  for free personal care for older people was not met. That was a specific  manifesto commitment of all four Executive parties. They all contested the  election having indicated that that was a priority; however, they have not  delivered.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">On transport, the Alliance Party has been clear that, in  funding, the ratio of roads to public transport should be shifted in favour of public transport, and particularly towards rail. If imposing tolls on new roads is  necessary to make that viable, so be it. Toll roads have proved  effective in the South. We want to know precisely what the allocation is for.  Is a light-rail system to be constructed, or are we getting just another  consultant&rsquo;s report? When will the results of the current report be made  available to Members and the public? The Minister must use that allocation to  prove that he is serious about his shift towards public transport, particularly  with respect to the greater Belfast  area, where, if properly delivered, a light railway would serve to ease  congestion dramatically.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Last Tuesday, the Minister referred to our putting our  shoulders to the wheel. The Alliance Party would like to get its hands on the  wheel, never mind its shoulders. I hope  that our day will come in that respect.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr D Bradley: Tiocfaidh &aacute;r l&aacute;.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Lunn: You stole my line, Dominic.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the meantime, my party will continue to provide input,  make suggestions and try to provide constructive opposition, even in the teeth  of criticism.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">4.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">The Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for Social  Development (Mr Hilditch): As Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for Social  Development, I welcome the motion tabled by  the Minister of Finance and Personnel on the programme for expenditure  proposals 2008-09 to 2010-11 as set out in the Budget that was laid before the  Assembly on 22 January 2008.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee welcomes the additional allocation for social  housing in the final Budget and is grateful that the four-party Executive  listened to all concerns expressed during the consultation process on the  funding that was originally allocated.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Providing access to decent, affordable, energy-efficient  housing is a priority for the Department for Social Development. The additional  &pound;250 million that has been agreed for investment in that area will go a long  way towards increasing the supply of social homes. The severe lack of  affordable and social housing is a serious issue. I want to re-emphasise the  need for joined-up Government, which other Members referred to during the  debate on the draft Budget. The Department for Social Development must work strategically with other Departments, and all  Departments must be committed to dealing with the issue.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister has been unable to provide the Committee with  specific details on how that additional money will be allocated, although the  Committee understands that 5,250 houses will be built over the next three  years, and up to 10,000 additional affordable and social homes will be  delivered by 2013. The Committee must examine the wording that has been used &mdash;  &ldquo;up to 10,000&rdquo; &mdash; although that is a matter that  will be discussed with the Minister at a future date.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee will pay particular attention to how the warm  homes scheme will be taken forward in light of additional funding. That scheme  has proved to be a lifeline for some people &mdash; the vulnerable, the elderly, and  those who are in poverty. It is of the utmost importance that the most  disadvantaged and vulnerable people in society benefit from the Budget. Let it  not be forgotten that it was through the warm homes scheme that many people  were identified and subsequently benefited from the benefits uptake campaign  some time ago.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department for Social Development has a target to  deliver cash-releasing efficiencies of &pound;113&middot;7 million during the next three  years. That will be achieved through several measures; for example, the social  security modernisation programme, streamlining the delivery of urban  regeneration programmes, targeting housing resources much more effectively, and  realigning manpower levels in departmental priorities to bring about staff  reductions. That will provide the Department with additional spending power,  and the Committee will be interested in seeing the details of the Department&rsquo;s  efficiency programme.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Poots: The Member paints a fairly good picture of  the Budget outcomes for the Department for Social Development. Does he,  therefore, disagree with the previous SDLP speaker, who appeared to attack the  outcome of the process and the Minister for Social Development?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Hilditch: Indeed, I do disagree. The events of the  past 24 hours have been interesting.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Improving efficiency is a key element in the Budget  process. I commend the capital realisation task force&rsquo;s work to identify ways  in which more effective management of the Executive&rsquo;s assets might raise  additional funding. A potential &pound;900 million has been identified over the next  10 years, which is, indeed, a sizeable sum. The task force has also identified  ways that the proceeds from up to &pound;295 million worth of asset disposals might  be reinvested during the Budget period. However, I understand that further  analysis of the scope and feasibility of those potential disposals must be  carried out.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">During the consultation process on the draft Budget, significant pressures were identified by all  Departments. As I understand it, the only way that substantial extra  resources could have been allocated to any Department would have been by  reducing the allocations proposed for other Departments. The Committee welcomes  the Executive&rsquo;s decision not to pursue that option and is content for Minister  Ritchie to use her discretion to deploy her available resources in pursuit of  the Executive&rsquo;s strategic priorities and objectives as set out in the Programme for Government. The Committee  will, of course, play an important role in scrutinising and advising the Minister on all matters relating to  the Budget.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, the Committee supports the motion. The  Committee has worked as a sound and solid unit throughout the Budget  consultation process and has strongly supported Minister Ritchie in trying to  secure funds with which to deliver the goods. I, therefore, wonder how she will  feel about the SDLP members of the Committee potentially throwing her efforts  back in her face later today.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Earlier, Sammy Wilson put us in the mood for a song. It is  certainly not a case of, &ldquo;Wake up, Maggie&rdquo;, as in the words of Rod Stewart&rsquo;s  song &lsquo;Maggie May&rsquo;; rather, it is a case of, &ldquo;Wake up, SDLP.&rdquo; I support the  motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Gardiner: I preface my remarks by saying that I  welcome the fact that the Budget is a Northern Ireland Budget that is presented  by a Northern Ireland  Finance Minister to a Northern Ireland Assembly. </p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to examine the  Budget&rsquo;s impact on the environment; Roads Service; the delivery of  public-service reform; and, in particular, planning reform.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">For environmentalists, the Budget is the Budget that was  not. The opportunity to create and fund an independent environmental protection  agency has been let slip. Given that we have a three-year Programme for Government, we, therefore, arrive at the  inescapable conclusion that nothing will be done on that front for at  least three years. It is not a question of &ldquo;Next year in Jerusalem&rdquo;,  nor is it even a question of the year-after-next-year in Jerusalem. We remain the only part of the United Kingdom  without an independent environ&shy;mental protection agency. For those on the other  side of the community divide, we remain the only part of the island of Ireland  without an independent environmental protection agency. </p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Farmers&rsquo; concerns must be taken on board, and properly. At  the same time &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr T Clarke: Will the Member give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Gardiner: I will not give way; I need all the time  in which I am allowed to speak.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Farmers&rsquo; concerns must be taken on board, and properly. At  the same time, however, that is no excuse for the continued inaction, and the  clear postponement of action to outside the three-year time frame. Like many  other Members, I had hoped to see a rationale behind environmental policy, and  the funding base in place to support reform. However, that is simply not there. </p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The same is true of the reform of our public  administration, including the reform of local councils, and the planning reform  that flows from that. Once again, I deplore the fact that that issue, among  others, appears to have been allowed to drift. That drift damages morale,  especially that of those who work in the  Planning Service. It does little to inspire confidence in Government  direction.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It would be remiss of me  not to mention the statement on the Giant&rsquo;s   Causeway that Minister Foster made earlier. I welcome it, and I  also welcome her decision. It is a great pity that that decision was not  reached earlier so that Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s image did not look as bad as it  does today.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although the maintenance of roads across Northern Ireland  is not an environmental issue, it is nonetheless important to the rural  community. Planned roads expenditure for 2007-08 is &pound;3,800 a mile. That is only  70% of the figure that was allocated for spending on roads four years ago. It  is planned that &pound;59 million will be spent on roads this year, compared with the  &pound;82 million spent in 2003-04. Worse still, that is a small fraction of spending  on roads elsewhere in the United    Kingdom. In England, the equivalent amount  spent is &pound;13,000 a kilometre, which converts to &pound;20,967 a mile. In Wales, &pound;7,600 a  kilometre is spent, which equates to &pound;12,258 a mile. As I have said, just  &pound;3,800 a mile is spent on roads in Northern Ireland.  Spending on roads in Northern Ireland stands at just 18% of that in England and 31% of that in Wales.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If that situation is not attended to, it will lead to  serious long-term problems. Look at the amount of money that has had to be spent on the rail infrastructure in England because  of decades of neglect. There is already evidence that that unfortunate pattern  may be repeated in Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s road system.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In 2006, DRD spent over &pound;101,000 to settle 425 claims. In  2007, over &pound;73,000 of taxpayers&rsquo; money was used to settle 445 of the 934 claims  that were submitted. The Department for Regional Development has paid out  almost &pound;330,000 on personal injury and vehicle damage claims since 2005. </p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that if there is an underspend in any Department,  the Minister of Finance and Personnel will ensure that the environment, roads,  public services and planning reform are assisted, to improve those services for  the benefit of all the people in Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Durkan: I support amendment No 2. Other Members have  questioned and attacked the SDLP&rsquo;s right to table an amendment because the  party has a Minister in the Executive. However, Members have not been able to  refute any of the points in our amendment. The Budget proposals do not provide  clear budgetary lines for the key policy developments that are being  championed, including the anti-poverty strategy. The best that Sammy Wilson  could offer was an acknowledgement that that is true, but that it could not be  so anyway.</p>	      
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Our amendment says that the Budget proposals:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;fail to set out funding commitments in respect of  proposed reforms in post-primary education&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That is absolutely true; nobody is able to say that  the <span style="letter-spacing:-.05pt; ">funding proposals are clear in the  Budget, because</span> they are not. If it is an all-singing, all-dancing  Budget, and if post-primary education reform is the most important issue that  is facing us, it is bizarre in the extreme that that is not provided for in the  Budget, and not even addressed or mentioned  in the Programme for Government.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is also true that the Budget proposals:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;abandon cross-cutting funds, including a fund for  children and young people&rdquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The integrated development fund is also to be wound  up. That is exactly the type of fund that would have worked well in somewhere  such as Limavady, with the <span style="letter-spacing:-.25pt; ">challenges that  it is facing, because that fund was designed</span> exactly to meet social and  economic challenges in different localities.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Our amendment is also right to say that the Budget  proposals:</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText"><span style="font-size:8.5pt; ">&ldquo;are unclear in their implications for householders in terms of future  charging for water.&rdquo;</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">When the reviews of water and rates were announced,  the timelines that were given suggested that outcomes would be available by the  time that we were taking <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt; ">decisions on the  revised Budget. That has not happened</span>; the  strand two report on water was published yesterday, and it is going out  for a 12-week consultation. There are implications in the recommendations of  that report, <span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt; ">and in the likely response of  the Executive and Ministers.</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Ministers are not saying that they will endorse the  recommendations of the independent panel to source water revenue as part of the rates, with no separate charges or  metering. It seems that Ministers are prepared to consider other options for  charging and separate water charges. The SDLP stood on a clear manifesto that  said no separate water charges; we wanted water revenue to be a clear,  transparent part of the rates. That was our position  in the last Executive; we wrote that option into the rating policy  review that was brought forward at that  time. The SDLP has taken that position consistently. Other parties have said that that is their  consistent position, but they seem to be shifting in the current  context. We are not.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, all the points of our amendment stand. If we were guilty of opportunism and cynicism, we  would have thrown all sorts of populist and attractive issues into our amendment, such as proposals for free  personal care and free prescriptions, which other parties had in their  manifestos.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, we did not  include those issues in our amend&shy;<span style="letter-spacing:-.35pt; ">&shy;</span><span style="letter-spacing:-.6pt; ">ment,</span><span style="letter-spacing:-.3pt; "> because we recognise that, due to current constraints</span>, some of them will not be feasible unless  we achieve other savings and resources over time.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">4.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The amendment is clearly focused, reasoned and restrained.  When the Programme for Government and the Budget were presented, Sinn F&eacute;in and  the DUP were at pains to say that they were different, that it was their  production now, and that they were doing things differently from how other  parties would have done them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP&rsquo;s amendment simply makes the point that we would  have done things differently if we had been in a stronger position. Apparently,  that is wrong. We are not making some unspeakable point &mdash; we are simply saying that we would have done things differently  and that we have done things differently in the past.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We created the Executive programme funds as a way of  getting more cross-cutting effort and more joined-up approaches across  Government. Members now tell us that they  do not favour such approaches, but the same Members were complaining  yesterday about silo approaches. Cross-cutting funds, commissioning bids, and  proposals from parties for more joined-up actions were designed to get over  that silo mentality.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Funds are now simply being given back to Depart&shy;ments; that  is spending via the traditional Civil Service route, which is through  Departments. Some of us want things to be more radical than that. We are told  that the Programme for Government and the Budget are about more cross-cutting  actions. We are also told that the Budget  clearly supports the Programme for Government, but, on Sammy Wilson&rsquo;s admission today, that is not the case. There is much talk about cross-cutting  actions and initiatives in the Programme for Government, but there is no  trace of associated budgetary lines in the Budget.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Claims have been made that the SDLP should be prevented  from tabling amendments. However, the Assembly, not the Executive, takes the  legal decision to approve the Budget, and all Members must take that responsibility  seriously. If the Assembly&rsquo;s purpose were merely to rubber-stamp whatever the  Executive agreed, it should not exist at all.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr P Robinson: That is the most absurd argument that I  have ever heard. It is not a case of denying the SDLP the right to table an  amendment &mdash; it is the ambush by the SDLP in its decision to table it now. The party failed to table the amendment at the  Executive where it could have had an impact on the Budget.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Durkan: It is not an ambush. When Ministers  negotiate a Budget, inevitably they concentrate on the budget lines of their  Departments. From my experience of budgetary matters, that is what motivated  Ministers in the past. They were most  focused on their own budget lines, and that is right and proper. Indeed,  in today&rsquo;s debate the Ulster Unionist Party stated that although it has reservations about aspects of the Budget, it  supports the Budget because of its Ministers&rsquo; share of it. It is natural  and proper for Ministers to prioritise and focus on what they will get for their  Departments and for key budget lines.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Margaret Ritchie rightly and strongly set out her  priorities on social and affordable housing. She also rightly and properly made  gains between the draft Budget and the revised Budget, and she voted for the  Budget at the Executive to secure that budget line. That is how people have  endorsed and agreed Budgets in the past. I know from experience &mdash; and the  Finance Minister will realise in the future &mdash; that Ministers will soon tell him  that although they agreed the Budget, they wanted to leave room for manoeuvre  and wanted other things to be included in it. Those are the terms in which  Ministers agree to such things.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, parties in the Assembly are different. The Minister of Finance told us last week that  parties should not determine their  position on the Budget simply on the basis of how well their Minister is  doing. Our Minister has done well in respect  of social and affordable housing in  the revised Budget. However, there are other questions to be asked about  it. No party should be bought and bound because of budgetary gains achieved by  its Minister.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are wholesale issues in relation to the Budget, and  our amendment touches on only some of them. It is realistic to request  cross-cutting funds in the style of Executive programme funds to support  priorities and to ensure that Departments must show good form in taking forward  some of those measures.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">This is a three-year Budget, and we cannot vote in the  blind with regard to what will happen to water charges, for example. We do not  want to be told, down the road, that our  endorsement of the three-year Budget, when the recommendations of  strands one and two of the independent water review panel&rsquo;s report were known,  implied that we were going along with the plans for water charges &mdash; whatever  they might be. We are not. Our position holds. The Budget states that there  will be a reduced subsidy for water. We know that there are plans afoot, but we  have not seen them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Before the House is a three-year Budget, and the SDLP will  not vote in the blind when such unknowns and ambiguities exist.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP stands by its manifesto commitments; we reflect  our mandate. The SDLP Minister made the strongest possible case at the  Executive, and set out strong grounds on inclusion and deprivation during the  early work on the draft Programme for Government. She clearly stated her reservations about certain aspects and  dimensions of the Programme for Government and <span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt; ">its related Budget. She did not table a formal amendment,</span> and, in  those circumstances, neither would I have done. My priority would have been to  ensure that I secured the improved budget line for my Department. If Margaret  Ritchie had tabled an amendment at that stage, it would have resulted in a  further downwards revision in her own budget line.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP is properly using its position in the Assembly.  This is not an ambush; it is accountability and democratic politics in the  interests of the public.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Ms Purvis: I am grateful for the opportunity to speak  in the debate. The Budget is allocated to deliver the Executive&rsquo;s priorities as  set out in the Programme for Government.  This Budget will not reduce or eliminate child poverty or protect our  environment. Rather, it will increase deprivation with the introduction of  water charges. The Budget benefits big business, developers and owners of big  cars.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">More than 100,000 children are living in officially defined  levels of poverty in Northern    Ireland. That means that 100,000 children  are not given the chance to experience or make choices that can improve their  lives. Not all of those children are from families who live on benefits; 47% of  children living in poverty in Northern    Ireland live in a family with at least one  working parent.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The impact of poverty and deprivation is stark. Infant  death is one-third higher in deprived areas, and teenage pregnancy rates are  higher. Some 28% of those living in deprived areas do not have a bank account;  therefore, they pay more for financial services and utilities. Children from  deprived areas do less well at school. We know that from the 11-plus results  and performances at GCSE level and in further and higher education.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are 27,000 families with children in Northern Ireland  living in fuel poverty. The Budget contained a new allocation to fuel poverty,  but it will do nothing to reduce the 2008  waiting list on the warm homes scheme. Families with disabled children  are 50% more likely to be in debt. Although all families in Northern Ireland  can afford to feed their children, their diets are not sufficient for proper  health and well-being. Everyone knows how diet can benefit a child&rsquo;s progress  and development.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I do not believe that the Executive will start to tackle  child poverty, and Members must look at the contradictions. The future of  community education programmes is in question. Those programmes help many  people in the most deprived areas in Northern Ireland, especially women.  They help women to return to education and, eventually, to the labour market.  Those programmes are under threat, and if they end, the Executive&rsquo;s priorities  will not be delivered.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Government initiatives regarding childcare &mdash; including Sure  Start &mdash; have been developed. Many parents, particularly lone parents,  continually struggle to find flexible quality and affordable childcare.  Childcare is essential in supporting those people in their return to work. The  lack of proper, affordable, good quality and flexible childcare will add to the  levels of child poverty in Northern    Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Families who are affected by disability need more help than  others &mdash; bringing up a disabled child costs three times more than raising a  non-disabled child. Parents of such families are less likely to work and, if  they do, they are more likely to be in low-paid jobs. If the Executive are to  tackle child poverty, they must address those and other issues seriously.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The children&rsquo;s fund, which was one of the Executive programme funds, has helped many children in  deprived areas of Northern    Ireland. Over the past year, I have  encountered several projects that have benefited many families in my  constituency of East Belfast: one example is  the Tullycarnet family project. </p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, the Quaker Cottage teen project works with  young people who are at risk from suicide, self harm and drug abuse. As the  children&rsquo;s fund is to be scrapped, what will happen to those projects, and the  children and families they support? Funding for many projects is not  ring-fenced, or mainstreamed, and people will suffer as a result.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I will briefly mention water charging. As I said yesterday,  my party is opposed to the introduction of water charges. People here have been  paying for water through their rates and should not have to pay twice. Families  receiving rate relief will not benefit by the introduction of water charges.  When water charges are introduced, everyone in this society will be expected to  pay, and, therefore, people who receive benefit and rate relief will not be  &pound;1,000 better off following the Budget. It is another expense that vulnerable  families could do without.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Gardiner spoke about the need to protect the  environment. I fail to comprehend how money for roads rather than much-needed  investment in public transport, to make it a viable, quality choice for people,  will reduce emissions or our carbon footprint.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As one of the few left-of-centre representatives in the  Chamber, I must criticise the concentrated use of PFIs and PPPs. I note the  comments made by the Chairperson of the  Committee for Finance and Personnel; and given that Sinn F&eacute;in is  chuckling its way towards raving capitalism and is voting for the Budget, I am  astonished that its members can stand up in this House and criticise the use of PFI. PFI goes against democratic  principles; it benefits private developers and it is not a fair deal for taxpayers. Private developers are  unelected and unaccountable, and  those who are using PFI to take over our hospitals and schools will  leave a millstone of debt &mdash; potentially  billions of pounds &mdash; for our children.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, much has been said about criticism of the Budget.  Everyone wants devolution, the Assembly, and the Executive to work and succeed.  However, there is a way to bring down the Executive and the structures of  Government and bring the Assembly to an end. It was not taken up during the  last Executive, but the potential is still there &mdash; people do not have to vote  for this Budget if they do not want to do so.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr McElduff: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann  Comhairle. Ar dt&uacute;s, ba mhaith liom labhairt ar son an Choiste Cult&uacute;ir agus  ansin c&uacute;pla focal a r&aacute; mar Chomhalta pr&iacute;obh&aacute;ideach.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I will make some opening remarks in my capacity as the  Chairperson of the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure, a LeasCheann  Comhairle, followed by some comments as an individual MLA.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">First, I will comment on the aspects of the Budget  allocation that relate to the arts, libraries and sport. I welcome the Budget  increase for the arts. Although relatively modest, it is nonetheless an  increase. Of course, arts sector representatives continue to say that the  settlement falls short of requirements and will not deliver a per-capita  funding figure matching other regions in these islands. For example, in the  Twenty-six Counties the figure is close to &pound;14, whereas it is less than &pound;7 in  the North.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">4.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I commend the arts lobby for putting a coherent and  compelling case to the forefront of political awareness in the time between the  publication of the draft Budget and the final Budget allocations. The Finance  Minister said in his Budget statement on 22 January 2008:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Of all the issues, funding for the arts was the main  theme in terms of the quantity of responses, reflecting a well-organised effort  by the arts sector to highlight its concerns&rdquo;. <span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; ">[Official Report, Vol 26,  No 7, p315, col 2].</span></span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The arts lobby  made itself heard. The Executive showed that they were prepared to listen and respond positively, which is a welcome development that shows the  positive impact of the new political dispensation. We all have a better  understanding of the contribution of the arts to wider society in areas such as  health, the economy and cultural tourism.  The Minister of Finance and Personnel acknowledged those benefits in his  Budget speech.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although the situation is better than it would have been under the draft Budget, serious challenges  remain. Like the arts, libraries in the North enjoy significantly less  funding per capita than in other regions. The additional &pound;0&middot;5 million each year  is welcome. On 22 January, the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure heard  representatives from the education and library boards voice concern that  reductions and efficiencies have already been carried out and that there is  nothing more to give. That is a crucial area for the continual attention of the  Executive. I am mindful that other monitoring rounds and the spring  Supplementary Estimates lie in the immediate future &mdash; I hope that the Executive  continue to show that they are listening to those lobbies that make strong and  compelling cases.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Libraries are undervalued and, perhaps, undersold. They  play a crucial role in tackling problems of illiteracy, and they make provision  for migrant workers who often use Internet and other facilities. The Office of  the First Minister and deputy First Minister must have a greater appreciation  of the beneficial role that library provision has for migrant workers and  ethnic communities, and the role of libraries in the promotion and facilitation  of cultural tourism.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">At a time when there is a freeze on capital projects at a  community level, where much good work is being done, it is regrettable that there is no additional funding for  sport. I have just come from a wonderful event in the Long Gallery, which  celebrated the work of an excellent community-based sporting organisation in Belfast called Cumann Sp&oacute;rt an Phobail, which operates in  the Ballymurphy, Upper Springfield and  Whiterock areas. With Sport NI, we saw evidence of tremendous work happening at  a community level to improve sports facilities and opportunities for young and  old people. Therefore, it is regrettable that there is no additional funding for sport in the Budget. Members must send  positive messages about the role of sport in promoting health and tackling  obesity and remind ourselves of the  Executive target to get 125,000 children in the North participating in sport and physical recreation by  2011. I take this opportunity to reinforce those points about sport, arts and  libraries.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As an MLA, I welcome  the extra &pound;4&middot;6 million allocated to youth services in the final Budget.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Again, the Minister of Education, Caitr&iacute;ona Ruane, has  listened during the consultation period, and has recognised the importance of  youth services, youth clubs and youth projects. The final allocation reveals  that there will be an additional &pound;4&middot;6 million over three years. However, I have  to say that the Executive must keep their eye on that particular ball. We must  listen to the Youth Service and the youth sector about the challenges that they  face. I ask the Minister of Finance and Personnel whether opportunities might  arise for youth projects in the upcoming monitoring rounds and the spring  Supplementary Estimates.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The final Budget allocation shows that Ministers are  listening, but they must demonstrate that they are continuing to listen as  other opportunities arise.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr D Bradley: The Member was absent from the Chamber  when I raised this point earlier. Will he agree with me that it would be  advantageous if the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure would listen more  closely to the Irish language lobby? I refer in particular to the Irish  language film fund, which has not been catered for in this Budget. Many small  companies depend on that fund for training and production support. If the fund  is not augmented, that would represent bad practice. Indeed, the investment that  has already been made would be wasted, and I am sure that the Minister of Finance and Personnel would not agree with  wasting resources in such a way, a LeasCheann Comhairle.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr McElduff: Ba mhaith liom taca&iacute;ocht a thabhairt don  m&eacute;id at&aacute; r&aacute;ite ag Dominic &Oacute; Brollach&aacute;in. I agree 100% with Mr Bradley&rsquo;s point.  I am pleased that the Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure is in the Chamber  to hear that very important message.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive should take every opportunity, in this Budget and in the coming times, to demonstrate  support for the building trade and the construction industry. We know  about the policy climate created by PPS 14, and that chartered surveyors are  saying that projects are being delayed. We know that social housing must be  delivered. Nevertheless, the Executive and the Minister of Finance and  Personnel must hear those messages.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I recently spoke in the Chamber to the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment, who said that he hoped that the Minister of Finance and Personnel  would hear the same message. I ask the Minister of Finance and Personnel to  take particular cognisance of petrol retailers in communities on this side of  the border, who have had their businesses disadvantaged by proximity to petrol  retailers on the other side of the border. Those businesses have been decimated  over many decades by that situation, and, I am sure, other factors that Members  may choose to draw to my attention. However, I ask the Minister to examine Varney II in the near future in order to find  opportunities to introduce  compensatory measures for those businesses.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">This is a four-party Budget, produced by a four-party  Executive. It is good work, as has already been said by the Chairperson of the  Committee for Finance and Personnel, Mitchel McLaughlin. We have arrived at the Budget allocation, the Programme for  Government and the investment  strategy. However, there is no escaping the reality that major obstacles  to delivery by the Executive remain. One of those obstacles is the fact that  taxation and public expenditure policy are still set in London.  We should not keep pushing that issue further down the road. Go raibh  maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Simpson: This has been an interesting debate over  the past few hours. I was going to say that it was an intelligent debate, but  having heard some of the comments that have been made by Members from some  parties, I have to wonder.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">A Member: You are  talking about the Alliance Party.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Simpson: I am looking at the Alliance Party. Many  years ago, there used to be an old preacher in Northern Ireland called W P  Nicholson, who, when he heard people talking nonsense, would say that it was  &ldquo;tripe with a capital T&rdquo;. Well, I have listened to some tripe with a capital T  in this Chamber today.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Naively, I thought more  of the Alliance Party because I understand that some of its Members come  from a business background. I thought that they at least would have had some  intelligent ideas on taxation, and, in particular, on industrial derating.  However, we live day by day, and we are surprised many times. That is the way  it goes.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I support the Budget, which is innovative and can only be  good for Northern Ireland.  A number of messages must be sent out from this Chamber. First, the SDLP&rsquo;s  behaviour should be condemned over and over again.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Some Members: Hear, hear.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Simpson: The Trimble/Mallon Assembly was quite some time ago &mdash; in fact, I can scarcely  remember the two individuals in question. However, they tell me that  they once ran the Assembly. At that time, the DUP Ministers took up their  ministerial positions, but they acted against the Executive. Why did they do  that? Why did the DUP embark on that course of action? There was one  fundamental reason: the party opposed the  arrangements that were then in place; it campaigned and issued policy  documents against them, and it suggested alternative arrangements.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Durkan: Now the DUP operates those same  arrangements.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Simpson: Hold on a wee second; I know that it is  beginning to hurt.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Storey: They think that they won the election.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Simpson: Yes, that is exactly right.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, the same cannot be said of the SDLP; its Members  support the current arrangements; they have campaigned and electioneered in  favour of them, and they have spoken and written in favour of them. They  rallied behind the Minister for Social Development as she sought greater  funding to carry out her work in the Executive.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Yet, in an entirely selfish, hypocritical manoeuvre, SDLP  Members shafted their own Minister. They left her high and dry, letting her go  through one Lobby in favour of the PFG while they went through the other Lobby  to cast votes to oppose her actions. Shame on the SDLP. Such behaviour &mdash;  &ldquo;Durkanomics&rdquo; &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span> &mdash; does not even have the  safety net of political gain. The SDLP is a party in decline whose members  desperately hope that Bertie Ahern will take time off to save not only his own  political bacon but theirs too.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Lord Morrow: He cannot do both.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Simpson: No, he cannot.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Budget ought to be welcomed as a good beginning on the  journey towards a better future. It confirms the freeze on rates over three  years and that industrial rates will be capped at 30%; it also addresses the  priority given to the economy by the Programme for Government. The Executive have increased allocations to the  Department for Employment and Learning by some 35%, which is very welcome.  Furthermore, DETI has received another 21% increase in funding.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Budget also provides for the largest ever allocations  for capital investment in new public-sector infrastructure &mdash; more than &pound;2  billion a year by 2010 and 2011. That will help to promote a programme of  investment in hospitals, schools, housing, roads, public transport and other  public services. Northern    Ireland must move forwards towards a more  private-sector-led economy if it is to  prosper and compete in future. Depend&shy;ence on the public sector is now  an obstacle to our development. In today&rsquo;s  economic climate, Government or Assembly intervention can have only a  limited influence on the economy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Alongside that, however, the Assembly will be required to  deliver infrastructure, promote tolerance, health and well-being, advance  environmental issues, and create excellent and efficient public services.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">5.00 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am pleased that a funding increase has been allocated to  Margaret Richie, because all Members of the House have been lobbied many, many  times on social and affordable housing. The  lack of such housing has created major difficulties, and it is good to  see that her Department&rsquo;s budget has been increased.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The additional money for  the Health Minister, Michael McGimpsey,  is most welcome. It is rumoured that when Michael McGimpsey heard the  news that his budget was to be substantially increased &mdash; and I emphasise that it is only a rumour &mdash; he almost smiled. I  know that Members may find that hard to believe. However, no paparazzi were there to take a photograph, and,  perhaps, that is a malicious rumour that should not be repeated.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the additional funds that have been announced in the Budget. The Department of the  Environ&shy;ment will receive additional funding of &pound;103,000 over the next  three years to contribute to the delivery of the Queen&rsquo;s University-led  omnivore project, which seeks to develop a prototype engine that will optimise  the combustion of a range of biofuels and fossil fuels.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure will receive an additional &pound;5 million for the creative  industries seed fund.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment will receive an additional &pound;14 million  to fund a range of projects, including the promotion of investment and  innovation and research.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department for Employment and Learning will receive an  additional &pound;40 million over the next three years to fund various projects.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Northern    Ireland still has a long way to go, and  there are outstanding issues to be tackled. The actions of the SDLP in the past  24 hours have again brought to light the need to move towards a more normal  system of Government and away from the current model &mdash; the deficiencies of  which have been highlighted in the Assembly this week.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Notwithstanding those issues, the Budget, coupled with &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Durkan: Will the Member give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Simpson: I am about to finish.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Budget, coupled with the Programme for Government,  affords the Assembly an opportunity to set its sails.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Durkan: Will the Member address the fact that he and  his colleagues, including the Finance Minister, regularly vote against the  Westminster Budget, which includes the allocation of public expenditure here?  Doing so is not perceived as irresponsible, but as good democratic practice.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Simpson: The  difference, as the Finance Minister said, is that the DUP does not sit  in the Cabinet at Westminster.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Durkan: The Westminster Budget includes allocations  for here.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Simpson: The  Budget will start Northern    Ireland off on a good footing, and  Members can look forward to a better future for the Province.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Moutray: I join my party colleagues in paying  tribute to the Minister of Finance and Personnel for delivering to the House and the Province a momentous, forward-thinking and business-led Budget.  Remarkably, it is the first Budget to emanate from the House in almost  40 years. As such, the Budget is a political landmark for the Province, and it  will aid in providing a peaceful,  prosperous and fair society today, tomorrow and in the years that lie  ahead.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members have witnessed a great milestone in local politics:  the Budget will afford us, as elected represent&shy;atives, the opportunity to  deliver a better quality of life for those who live and work in Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">For many years, this Province suffered as a result of the  stagnation that was brought about by 30 years of terrorist violence and,  indeed, direct rule. Therefore, the Budget places Northern Ireland&rsquo;s destiny in our  hands. It places in our hands the building blocks with which a better and  brighter future can be achieved.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the fact that  the Budget has been accepted unanimously  and endorsed by the four Executive parties. The Budget sets out in great  detail the spending plans for the  Departments over the next number of years. Those plans include the  necessary expansion of the infra&shy;structure to satisfy modern investment;  increasing the educational attainment of young people; reducing poverty;  increasing economic activity; protecting our environment; reducing the number  of deaths on our roads; and reducing  treatment waiting times for patients. Those are, without doubt, real  issues that have affected and will continue to affect everyone in their daily  lives.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Budget enables us, as locally elected represent&shy;atives,  to allocate the resources to tackle those issues at first-hand. The Budget&rsquo;s  primary focus is on economic growth, clearly demonstrating the Executive&rsquo;s  long-term commitment to building a better future for the people of Northern Ireland.  That focus also aligns with the priorities  that have been identified in the Programme for Government and investment  strategy. Those are to grow a dynamic, innovative economy; to promote  tolerance, inclusion, health and well-being; to build and invest in  infrastructure; to deliver modern, high-quality and efficient public services;  and to protect and enhance our environment and natural resources.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Ultimately, those three  documents will work together to achieve the overarching aim of building  a strong and competitive Northern Ireland economy that will, in due course, reduce and eradicate poverty and social  exclusion.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I particularly welcome the Budget&rsquo;s efforts to implement  the investment strategy for Northern    Ireland to improve infrastructure; refocus  business-support measures on exports; implement the skills strategy and the FE Means Business strategy to improve  individuals&rsquo; skills; implement the regional innovation strategy; and  enhance linkages between the education and business sectors. All those will  contribute to the Executive&rsquo;s economic vision&rsquo;s being realised.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the Finance  Minister&rsquo;s additional allocations  for mental-health provision and for those with learning disabilities, in  particular, and for youth and library services, and, indeed, social housing.  That could not have been boasted about when we were subject to direct rule  policies.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The real challenge now is for each Minister to take  responsibility for administering those policies and ensuring that the Executive  are efficient. The 3% efficiency-savings targets that have been set are a  challenge for each Department. My plea is that the Departments endeavour to  exceed that target in order to provide additional spending power.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am proud to be a Member of an Assembly that, ultimately,  through this Budget, has displayed a vision for Northern Ireland. The Budget  identifies the real needs that exist in society, and notes the resources that  are available to tackle those needs. It will enable us to deliver, which is  what we were democratically elected to do.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Budget gives value for money for every pound that is  spent. However, we cannot enter this process of administration and roll it out  while wearing rose-tinted glasses. We must recognise the challenges and the  need for us, as elected representatives, to embrace them and prove that  devolution can make a real difference to people&rsquo;s lives.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">By tabling amendments yesterday and today, the SDLP has  demonstrated its backward-looking vision. I question whether there are  divisions in that party, given that the Minister for Social Development voted for the Programme for Government, while her  party colleagues voted against it. It appears that Margaret Ritchie&rsquo;s  party colleagues are unable to support her in her Executive decision.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Unlike the SDLP and the  Alliance Party, I, along with members of my party, endorse and agree to  the finely tuned, well-balanced and meticulously documented Budget that the  Minister of Finance and Personnel and the Executive have brought to the House.  I support the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr K Robinson: I was looking for evidence in the Budget  of specific funding for the massive educational changes that the Minister of  Education has proposed and that are centred on her new vision that transfer  should occur at the age of 14.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is clear that a restructuring of education, entailing  the creation of schools for 11- to 14-year-olds and 14-to 19-year-olds, is so  far-reaching that it is bound to involve considerable expenditure on new  buildings, staff training, support costs  for major curriculum change, and the redesign of existing buildings.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Inevitably, such a far-reaching process will involve a  fundamental look at the entire schools estate in Northern Ireland. In fact, I cannot  see how any such process would be able to avoid a major rationalisation process  as well. How can we evade the inevitable question in the face of such massive  changes? How can we continue to operate several distinct school systems &mdash; the  state system, a maintained system, an integrated system, and an Irish-medium  system? Surely we have an opportunity here to pursue a shared future for all.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Try as I might to find it, however, there was no mention of  additional funding for such a project in the educational provisions in the  Budget. That is a three-year spending programme; therefore, there is no money  for such a programme for at least three years. How can that be?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister of Education promised that selection would end  by the year 2009, which is just a year away. I heard that the Minister reckoned  that her proposals were, in the main, cost-neutral. How can that be? Unless, of course, her proposals involve the  rationalisation of her current four-fold system, with the introduction of a universal, one-size-fits-all system of  geographically based schools, with  postcode-selection processes, catering for an 11- to 14- year-old and a  14- to 19- year-old split. The sale of redundant school buildings might then be  used to generate the capital assets to fund the massive costs of such a radical restructuring of the school  system that selection at 14 would inevitably entail.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The absence of such earmarked funding in the Budget  indicates either that what the Minister said will happen simply will not  happen, or that there is another way of funding her proposals, outside the  ordinary constraints of the block grant.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister of Finance and Personnel said in his Budget  statement:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The task force  report identified a range of potential opportunities to reinvest the  proceeds of up to &pound;295 million of asset disposals over the next three years of  the Budget period. Further work remains to be done to analyse the scope and  feasibility of those potential disposals &hellip; and our capacity to reinvest these  proceeds.&rdquo; &mdash; <span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; ">[Offical Report, Vol 26, No 7, p317, col 1].</span></span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">It is unclear whether those disposals have already  been factored into the new Budget allocations announced last Tuesday. Perhaps  the Minister will let Members know, and  inform us whether he intends to put additional funds into the Department  of Education&rsquo;s budget to finance any such major restructuring of the schools,  as the Minister of Education contemplates.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In purely educational  terms, the Budget is a relatively modest  document. All that is evident from the budgetary figures is that the Executive have allocated an additional &pound;3 million for next year followed by a further &pound;5  million in each of the two following  years. That modest additional funding will provide for an increase in  the level of resource funding available for youth services each year over the  three-year Budget period.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, Youth Service personnel say that that equals a  standstill allocation to the youth sector, which will be a disappointment to  all those who put so much into working with  our young, and our &mdash; sometimes disaffected &mdash; youth.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The education targets in the Programme for Govern&shy;ment that  are funded by the Budget are similarly conservative. The aspiration is that by  2015, 80% of the working population will be qualified to GCSE level or  equivalent. Since the current figure of people with no qualifications is 21% in  Northern Ireland,  even the new targets are very conservative.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">At the moment, a quarter of our adult population has poor  literacy and numeracy levels, and, every year, 4,000 people reach the age of 16  without achieving a basic English or Maths qualification. The Department for Employment and Learning  should not have to do remedial work for the  Department of Education. That is important</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It may be worth restating that children do not fail at 11  years of age; rather, the system fails many of them in their early years.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">5.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the large-scale investment in further education.  That investment will support the Further Education Means Business strategy and  emphasises the fact that further education colleges will be the engines of  economic growth.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We cannot rely on the UK Exchequer or Europe  to pay our way. The economic focus in the Department for Employment and  Learning&rsquo;s budget is a precursor to eradicating underachievement, unemployment  and eventually, I hope, poverty. I also  welcome the provision in the Programme for Government for an annual  review. That represents not only a milestone in the progress towards targets  but will build in the capacity for adjustment to changing circumstances.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department for Employment and Learning recognises that  there is a clear link between the levels of spending on research and  development and the levels of innovation in  new products, economic growth, prosperity and employment. Hitherto, Northern Ireland has had a mixed record on  R&amp;D, although both Queen&rsquo;s University and the University of Ulster  are world leaders in their particular research fields. Sadly, however, if one  adds up the total spend on R&amp;D in Northern Ireland, it comes to about  1% of gross domestic product, while other industrial economies average between  2% and 3%.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I commend Sir Reg Empey, the Minister for Employment and  Learning, for his winning the largest share of the funds for innovation &mdash; some  &pound;40 million out of &pound;90 million. Those moneys are critical, because they make it possible to fund 300 new PhD  studentships, which will be in the areas of science, technology, engineering and mathematics. It is to be hoped  that those new studentships will lead to  positive spin-offs for our regional economy, which may eventually come  to resemble the Research Triangle Park  in North Carolina or the Silicon Valley in California. A pool of  world-class research students should provide a future magnet for foreign direct  investment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, I thank the Minister for his additional  allocations, totalling &pound;2 million, to the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure for 2008-09. Those allocations have  been made in response to specific issues that were raised during the public  consultation on the draft Budget, and they are very welcome.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Similarly, I acknowledge an additional &pound;5 million that has been allocated to the Department for its  creativity seed fund, which is important if creative potential and  innovation are to be unlocked. The connection between themes that have not been exploited previously is vital if we are to source new industry that is based on  creativity and design. We need to look closely at the performance of  that fund to see whether still more volume and range can be achieved as a  result of the additional funding.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, I have grave concerns about funding for sports and  the arts, the spending on which still lags behind every other UK region, even  though both are potentially key generators of economic income.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is good for the House and for Northern Ireland that the Assembly  has now turned to the real business of government. I am pleased that yesterday&rsquo;s  motion on the Programme for Government and the investment strategy was amended  to include an Ulster Unionist amendment that sought to create a process of  ongoing review for the Programme for Government. The Programme for Government  and the Budget are two sides of the one  coin, so, in light of ongoing experience, the potential exists for  flexibility and responsiveness in the allocations. I support the Budget  proposals.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr McCausland: I support the Budget, which is the  product of a four-party coalition, even if one of those parties seems to try to  suggest that it is not part of that coalition and, therefore, is not in some  way responsible for the Budget that emerged from that coalition. It seems that  that party is content to live in a state of delusion.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I shall concentrate on the Department of Culture, Arts and  Leisure, which, relative to some of the larger Departments, is small.  Nevertheless, it is a significant Department, because sport, culture, arts,  libraries and museums matter to many people. They affect the quality of life of  people in Northern Ireland,  and many people feel passionately about them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Several Members have already said that they would like more  money to be spent in some of those areas, and everyone in the House shares that  view. However, the Executive have a finite amount of money. The SDLP&rsquo;s problem  in demanding more money is that it cannot say where that money should be taken  from. Does it want the money to be taken from social development, health,  education or some other area?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Alliance Party can tell the House where it wants the  money to be taken from: it wants to take it from my pocket and from the pockets  of every person in Northern    Ireland. That is interesting, because the  Alliance Party has vanished from my constituency. We have not seen any of its  members, and they have not represented anyone there, for a long time. If that  party continues in its present way, it will probably disappear from the rest of  Northern Ireland  in the not too distant future. On hearing that the Alliance Party&rsquo;s view is  that everybody should pay much more, many people might decide that they do not  want to support it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Libraries and museums are major areas of the Department of  Culture, Arts and Leisure&rsquo;s expenditure. They  constitute half of the Department&rsquo;s total  budget, with 30% going to libraries  and 20% going to museums.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The North/South Language Body was mentioned earlier in the  debate; I am pleased to see that the funding for that is rising from &pound;6&middot;1  million this year to &pound;7&middot;4 million over the period of the Budget. Significant  funding is built into that for the Ulster-Scots Agency, which I welcome. Sadly,  over the years, that agency has suffered from serious underfunding, stretching  back to the formation of the language body  and the two agencies within it. That serious underfunding has created  difficulties for the Ulster-Scots language community and for the wider  community that is interested in Ulster-Scots culture. The allocation goes some  way towards redressing the shortfall that we have inherited from the period of  direct rule and earlier. The money will be used well, and many good projects  will benefit from it, right across Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Sport is one of those issues that has benefits not just in  the enjoyment that it creates, but in its impact on health. Culture, sport,  libraries and museums all have an impact on tourism. I am glad that the Budget  points to the clear links between those areas in the Department of Culture,  Arts and Leisure and the Executive priorities of growing a dynamic, innovative economy;  promoting tolerance, inclusion and well-being; investing in infrastructure; and  delivering modern, high-quality, efficient public services. Sport and culture  are important in providing a better quality of life, and they also have an  impact right across Government priorities.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Tourism is a major growth area in the economy, and cultural  tourism has been identified as a core area for growth. I welcome the fact that  even Tourism Ireland  has finally recognised in recent months that &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Shannon: I thank the Member for giving way. Does he  agree that Ulster Scots is an important growth area for cultural tourism? In my constituency, Strangford, the  rebirth of Ulster Scots has been a big talking point with regard to cultural  tourism in the area.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr McCausland: I thank the Member for his comments. I  was about to say that Tourism Ireland has identified the Scotch-Irish market in  America  as a wonderful opportunity for promoting tourism. I am sure that when the  Scotch-Irish come here, they will want to visit Strangford and the Ards Peninsula,  which is part of the Ulster-Scots heartland.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Shannon: I will be their guide.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr McCausland: We  do not want to go too far, please.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is recognition here of a potential tourist market  that remains untapped. For so long, Tourism Ireland has concentrated solely on  the Irish-American market. The other 20 million Americans whose roots are here  on this island, and particularly the northern part of the island &mdash; well, that  Scotch-Irish market has now been identified. The opportunity is there for us to  grow our tourism through that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome that &pound;32&middot;5 million is to be made available for arts and cultural infrastructure. In respect  of Belfast,  mention is made of the Metropolitan Arts Centre in the Cathedral Quarter, and  the new Lyric Theatre, which is to be built in the south of the city. I could  not miss the opportunity to commend Belfast City Council for spending so much  on the arts &mdash; of all Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s local councils, it spends the most  on the arts. It has certainly stepped up to the mark in respect of the aforementioned projects, and it will be investing  in them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">After consultation, an extra &pound;1&middot;5 million has been made  available for expenditure in the arts sector. That demonstrates that the  Executive have been responsive to the  opinions that they heard during consultation. The Department of Culture,  Arts and Leisure is investing &pound;146 million  to support the delivery of the draft Northern<span style="letter-spacing:0pt; "> Ireland</span> strategy for sport and physical recreation for 2007-2017.  The intention is that by 2011, that investment will have stopped the  decline of adult participation in sport and physical recreation. That decline  is to the detriment of the health and well-being of the people of Northern Ireland,  and that must be reversed. The investment is being made to reverse that  decline.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I mentioned cultural tourism &mdash; that must be related to our libraries, which, as has been noted  already, account for 30% of the Department&rsquo;s budget. If we want to  increase numbers, we need to increase and grow our cultural product so that  when folk come here, there are more things  for them to do. That will encourage them to stay longer, and to come back. When they are here, it will encourage  them to visit more parts of Northern    Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Investment is important in museums because, as well as the four museum sites that constitute the  National Museums and Galleries of Northern Ireland, the 31  independent museums must be considered. The key point is that through tourism,  such investment will be for the benefit of the economy as a whole, not just for  the benefit of our own folk.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, I note that the aforementioned issues tie in with  the theme that is embedded in the Programme for Government &mdash; a shared and  better future. If we are to have a better future for our society, it has to be  a shared future, and a central element in that is cultural diversity. Another  aspect must be the interdependence and relationships between different cultural  traditions.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">By developing our cultural infrastructure, and by growing  the cultural capital for today and tomorrow, we are contributing to a shared  future for Northern Ireland,  and that is something that I hope that everyone would welcome.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr B Wilson: I welcome the opportunity to give the  Green Party&rsquo;s views on the Budget.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Budget, as a whole,  is not bad, given the financial restrictions that the Executive placed  on themselves. I welcome the fact that some of the criticisms that were made in  the Assembly have been taken into account by the Minister of Finance and Personnel. I agree with his emphasis on  entrepreneurship, economic development and increasing skills. Those are  essential for the future of our economy. However, there are major issues that  have been ignored by the Budget, and I, therefore, intend to oppose it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Some Members have suggested that it is wrong to criticise  the Executive, and that anyone who does so is being negative and trying to  destabilise devolved Government. I do not subscribe to that view. I believe  that our most important role as MLAs is to scrutinise all Executive decisions and to highlight those with which we  disagree. Neither the Executive nor this Budget are above criticism. In  addition to the failure of the Budget to  take a shared future into account, it gets no marks for failing to  address environmental issues, as Mr Gardiner has pointed out.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive claim to be concerned about climate change,  but the policies that they will implement will have a detrimental impact on the  environment. They claim to be green, and to support sustainability, but there  is nothing in the Budget to substantiate those claims. In fact, all the  evidence is to the contrary &mdash; particularly with the abolition of the Reconnect  grants to support small, renewable energy systems, and the reduction of the  percentage of the Department for Regional  Development&rsquo;s budget for public transport. That, together with the  Minister of Finance and Personnel&rsquo;s recent  decision to change building regulations to state that the inclusion of renewables in new buildings is no  longer mandatory, is a total negation of the Executive&rsquo;s claim to support  sustainability.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">5.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The decision to abolish the Reconnect grants, which were  first introduced by Peter Hain, and the change in the building regulations sound the death knell for many small  businesses in Northern    Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Over the past two  years, the Department of Enterprise,  Trade and Investment (DETI) has encouraged firms to develop skills in  the installation of new renewable-energy systems. Their staff were encouraged  to take courses at the Renewable   Energy Installer   Academy, funded by DETI, and more than 800 installers completed  those courses. An industry based on the new  technology was evolving; students  were developing skills that were increasingly in demand, North and  South. However, that developing industry depended on the demand for microgeneration systems. The end of Reconnect  grants and the Finance Minister&rsquo;s  decision on building regula&shy;tions have destroyed that demand, and the  installers, rightly, feel betrayed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Recently, I attended a meeting in Downpatrick, at which the  installers expressed great anger at those decisions. They argued that they had  been let down by the Government and felt that they had wasted time and money in  acquiring those skills only to find that there was no demand for them. Some of  the installers even stated that they would be forced out of business if  Reconnect grants or similar support are not introduced immediately; others said  that they would have to seek work in the Republic, where such grants are  available and extremely popular.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister of Finance and Personnel&rsquo;s decision runs contrary to his claim to grow our indigenous  private sector. Northern    Ireland is losing small businesses that  could develop into much larger ones. It is a betrayal of everyone involved in the scheme. I appeal to the  Minister to find some way of  supporting the installers. We cannot afford to lose a large number of  small businesses that are at the cutting edge of technology.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That decision is at best short-sighted, particularly in the  light of last week&rsquo;s proposals by the European Commission, which will increase  targets for the use of renewable energy. The Irish Government recently increased grants for microgeneration systems, and  local authorities in GB are  strengthening building regulations to require greater energy efficiency  in new buildings. While others promote renewable energy, the Executive are  discouraging the uptake of renewable systems.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My other concern relates to the Health Service. As a former member of the Eastern Health and Social  Services Board, I was concerned  about the allocation for hospital services in the draft Budget. I  welcome the extra &pound;10 million, but it falls  considerably short of what is needed, according to the Bamford Review.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As I pointed out in the debate on the draft Budget, an  increase in the health budget of 2&middot;6% is the lowest for more than 10 years.  That percentage increase is equivalent to a freezing of the health budget when  one considers demographic pressures and  that Health Service inflation is higher than ordinary inflation.  Compared to an increase of 4% in real terms in England,  a freeze is unacceptable, particularly when one considers the length of trolley  waits in Northern Ireland  and other problems that are considerably worse than in England.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The differential in expenditure per head between Northern Ireland and England has reduced significantly  in recent years. A recent study showed that, taking into account age profile, deprivation levels and  market forces, the Health Service in Northern   Ireland requires 10% more resources per head than in England due to  its higher need. The present differential is about 4%, and the proposals for  2008-09 will erode the differential completely.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The additional money in the revised Budget, now agreed for  the comprehensive spending review (CSR) period, is welcome. However, according  to Professor Appleby it falls far short of what is needed &mdash; a point that he  made in his report to the Department of Finance and Personnel in 2005 and which he repeated in his evidence to the  Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The latest increase  raises our real-terms health budget by less than 2%, compared to the  previous 1&middot;1% &mdash; and is still a long way short of England&rsquo;s new money of 3&middot;7% over  the next three years. Efficiency and productivity improvements of 3% per annum  have already been factored in, and there is simply no scope for achieving  further savings except through closing services and hospitals.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The revised Budget sets out a wish list of additional  services. Last week, Members were informed about all the extra services that  were going to be provided, but there was no indication of where the resources  for any of those programmes would be coming from. The wish list is totally  unrealistic.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As a member of the  Eastern Health and Social Services Board, I recall that we had great  difficulty in achieving efficiency savings  of 1%. Therefore, it is over-optimistic to assume that efficiency  savings of 3% are achievable. Many Members have said that such savings can be  made, but they have not told us what those savings would mean in real terms, or  what is going to happen. Given that the NHS is labour intensive, it will mean  job losses; in fact, thousands of job losses &mdash; and it will be difficult to  explain to overworked nurses and overworked doctors, patients, and all those  who are on waiting lists why we are getting rid of a lot of staff.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Much of the savings and reorganisations that are supposed  to pay for the new services are already being made  in the present financial year, by reducing the number of health trusts  from 18 to five. Therefore, where will the Minister of Health, Social Services  and Public Safety find the money to bring Northern   Ireland into line with access targets and waiting times  in England?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Professor Appleby showed that there is a need for 7% higher  spending on health in Northern Ireland,  based on need, if we are to enjoy similar standards of care as those in England. Yet,  last week, he identified a &pound;500 million shortfall in health spending over the  CSR period. Therefore, not only are we going to have lower standards of care,  the gap between entitlements and expectations in Northern Ireland compared to  those in England will continue to widen. Access targets and waiting times here will simply not match English  levels in the foreseeable future.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Adams: Maith th&uacute;, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Go raibh m&iacute;le  maith agat. D&eacute;anaim comhghairdeas leis an Tion&oacute;l agus go h&aacute;irithe leis an Aire.  I commend the Executive, and the Minister of Finance and Personnel, in  particular, on the Budget. </p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive faced an enormous challenge in putting  together the Programme for Government, the Budget, and the investment package.  As other Members have noted, the issues that needed to be tackled included:  significantly high levels of disadvantage and poverty in many urban and rural  areas; serious underfunding in health and education services; the environment; cultural rights; infrastructure; the  crisis in the agriculture industry and economy; housing provision in the  community and voluntary sector, and many other issues.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The fact that we have  had to work within an inadequate block grant from the British Government  exacerbates the situation. It is a significant problem that taxation and public  expenditure policies are established in London,  as is our existence on the edge of British Exchequer concerns.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to address my remarks to the Members on the benches  opposite. Lack of economic sovereignty is something  that the Assembly, and unionist representatives in particular, will have to face up to. That is the difficult context  in which the Budget was produced.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in Members have stated their concerns about some  aspects of the Budget, including the failure &mdash; I would say refusal &mdash; of the  Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure to seek adequate funding for the Irish  language. However, given the limitations imposed on the available funding and  the conflicting demands placed upon the Budget, advances have been made,  especially in the commitments underpinning the Programme for Government, the  Budget, and the investment strategy, as well as the commitments to funding  levels, and the underlying strategy governing all of those. That strategy &mdash; the  equality impact assessment process &mdash; is the key element in the proper operation  of the equality mechanisms.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, we need to monitor the Programme for Government,  the Budget, and the investment strategy constantly  and be ready to redirect resources if necessary. More especially, the  Executive and the Assembly need to present  the British Government with a united demand for greater fiscal  independence and an increase in the block grant, if we are to deliver  high-quality public services and have a bigger, better, more effective, more  efficient and prosperous economy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Why should a British Chancellor worry about Ballymena, east Belfast or any of the areas that Members  represent?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am convinced that sustainable social and economic  progress in the region will occur only in the context of a single-island economy. Regardless of other  differences that exist among parties, none of them underestimates the  potential for greater prosperity that the all-Ireland political institutions,  agencies and bodies can bring in times ahead. All the parties have acknowledged  that fact. That potential must be exploited to the full.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, I wish to comment briefly on yesterday&rsquo;s decision  by the SDLP to vote against the Programme for Government. That is evidence of a  party that is totally lost, bewildered and confused. The fact is that the SDLP  believed that the institutions would not be re-established. It fought the  Assembly elections on that pretext. Until recently, its entire political  position was predicated on the belief that the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in were the  &ldquo;problem parties&rdquo;. That was its mantra. The SDLP leader stood in the middle of  a busy road with a large lollipop, asserting that a vote for the SDLP was the way to stop the DUP, while Sinn F&eacute;in went  about the business of trying to get the institutions back in place.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Since the institutions have been re-established, the SDLP  leadership has been unable to come to terms with  that new reality, with the results of the last Assembly election or with  the new political dispensation. If I were them &mdash; and I am not, thankfully &mdash; I  would take good advice from those who  believe that one must follow the will of the people. Yesterday&rsquo;s SDLP  decision was ad hoc; it was on the whim of the party&rsquo;s leaders. Members saw  their hasty exit from the Chamber during the debate on the Programme for  Government when their amendment was not accepted; and their fit of pique when  the UUP amendment was accepted. Therefore,  the SDLP position is not a considered one.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Durkan: Will the Member give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Adams: No, sir.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The logic of that hasty  decision is that it appears that the party will also vote against the  Budget. How can a party in the Executive &mdash; a party that is supposedly committed  to the Good Friday Agreement and its implementation &mdash; vote in favour of the  Programme for Government, Budget and investment strategy one week, and against  them the next? How can it vote for those measures in one forum, and against  them in another? That does not make sense.  Mark Durkan knows that. I have listened to the SDLP&rsquo;s efforts throughout  the debate. The party has failed to provide a logical or rational argument to  support its absurd position.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">No one should forget &mdash; my party certainly does not &mdash; that  the SDLP leader, along with David Trimble and the UUP, negotiated the  reinvestment and reform initiative &mdash; the ultimate in Thatcherite policy.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Durkan: Will the Member give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Adams: I will not give way.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That policy opened the door to British Government attempts  to privatise water services, which have now, thankfully, been ruled out by  Minister Conor Murphy. Nor should anyone forget that an SDLP Minister of Finance tried to push through legislation on the  strategic investment body &mdash; the vehicle for PFI, PPP and privatisation.  Is that social or democratic?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Of course, the SDLP has the right to oppose the Budget. No  one denies it that right. However, it is dishonest for that party to oppose and  support the Budget at the same time, and &mdash; here is the rub &mdash; then pretend that  it is doing so on principle. Sin &eacute;, a chara. Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr McFarland: I am saddened that the Budget is  overshadowed by the absence of the deal-makers&rsquo; peace dividend &mdash; that far-famed  &pound;1 billion package, which the DUP did not deliver.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">5.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Budget time encourages me to recall two previous Budgets  and the DUP&rsquo;s wailing and gnashing of teeth. In 2000, I recall that Sammy  Wilson urged Members to vote for an amendment to cut the North/South bodies  budget by 50% in order to:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;save livelihoods and put bread on the tables&rdquo;. &mdash; <span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; ">[Official  Report, Bound Volume 7, p186, col 2].</span></span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I offer a further quotation from the Hansard  report, in which Minister Dodds said:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;There are those who say that we should not get too  exercised about expenditure in the all-Ireland dimension of the Belfast Agreement.  Perhaps they can justify this to their constituents: for every million pounds  spent on the all-Ireland political dimensions of the Belfast Agreement, 200 extra heart operations  could be carried out, 25 houses might be built for the homeless, or 1,000 homes  could be adapted for disabled people.&rdquo; &mdash; <span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; ">[Official Report, Bound  Volume 7, p157, col 2].</span></span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">He further states:</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;For a million pounds we could put central heating in 300  family homes. Look at fuel poverty: 170,000 homes in Northern Ireland still do not have  adequate heating.&rdquo; &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Official Report, Bound Volume 7, p157,  col 2].</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the following year, Lord Morrow said that &pound;1&middot;2 million  should be taken off the North/South bodies budget and put into the warm homes  scheme. This year, now that the DUP is in Government, is there a demand for a  reduction in the North/South element of the Budget? There is not. What a  difference an election makes to the DUP position on &ldquo;North/Southery&rdquo;, as Peter  Robinson described it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">During the debate, Mr Alban Maginness referred to the DUP&rsquo;s intention, in 2000-01, to destroy the  Executive. However, he did not  recall that when a single vote would have torpedoed the Budget and the  Executive, the DUP Members, sadly,  bottled-out and made themselves scarce, which ensured the survival of  the First Assembly and the Belfast Agreement. That is amazing.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Budget targets  concern me. Some are ambitious, and others are impossible &mdash; for example,  the ending of child poverty by 2012. There is a tendency, as each year ends, to  concentrate on the future and the next Budget. Often, little attention is paid  to whether the targets for the current year have been met. Will the Finance  Minister assure us that, as the financial year ends in March, the success, or  lack of it, in achieving the targets this year will encourage him to examine whether the targets for the coming year are  genuine and whether, perhaps, the Budget needs to be readjusted?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Budget delivery depends on a 3% efficiency saving. In  recent years, those types of targets have been missed by 50%. If that figure is  applied to the Budget for the coming year,  the Minister will find that he is &pound;1&middot;5 billion short in his Budget. I  welcome the setting-up of the performance efficiency delivery unit. Ministers  should be encouraged to accept the help of that unit. Its involvement in  challenging present practices and identifying savings will probably allow Ministers,  in all Departments, to take credit for the easy decisions while blaming the  unit for the difficult ones. By the end of the year we may be on the way to  achieving those efficiencies.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I echo the call for the reform of the Planning Service to  take place quickly. How can we encourage businesses to locate here when the  building of their new premises may be delayed by up to two years under the  present planning process? The Enterprise, Trade  and Investment Committee examined the current system for Minister Dodds, and  his stewardship of the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway  landmark project. The Department of Trade, Enterprise and Investment has been allocated a budget of &pound;21 million to support that  particular venture. I hope that  funding will be available to support the new venture that is being  developed by the National Trust.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, the UUP supports the Budget. However, we  have pointed out that there must be adjustments as confusion on policies emerges  &mdash; for example, the lack of clarity on the water rates issue. We will monitor  that and act in the best interests of our constituents. I support the Budget.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Speaker: I remind Members that both winding-up  speeches are limited to five minutes each.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Attwood: I thank  Members for their contributions to  the debate. I also thank, in particular, those Members &mdash; across all of  the parties in the Chamber &mdash; who put on record the Budget&rsquo;s gaps, flaws and  fault lines.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If the speeches and comments that have been made about  sports and arts, regional development, education, and the environment are  joined up, it is clear that the gloss has gone off Peter Robinson&rsquo;s first  Budget &mdash; no matter how parties vote this evening. The flaws and fault lines are  now on record.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I particularly applaud some of the contributions on the  Budget, including that of the Sinn F&eacute;in president, both in the Chamber and in  the comments that he has made to the media. He said that the SDLP&rsquo;s approach  has displayed:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;a lack of considered and consistent leadership&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Adams: That is correct.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Attwood: Let us examine the record of his party,  which joined the Policing Board after it said that it would not do so until  Special Branch had been disbanded. Sinn F&eacute;in said that it wanted MI5 out of Northern Ireland, and then it agreed to a deeper  and bigger role for MI5 in Northern    Ireland. Less than a year ago, Sinn F&eacute;in  gave a manifesto commitment to: </p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Ringfence a meaningful proportion of the annual  budget for programmes aimed at tackling economic inequality and poverty.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That commitment has been airbrushed out of the  Budget, as has Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s commitment to try to secure 5,000 new units of  housing. </p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">When Margaret Ritchie had to challenge Peter Robinson on  her Budget line on housing, Sinn F&eacute;in said  that she should stop whingeing. Where is Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s manifesto  commitment &mdash; a deal that was done with the electorate less than a year ago &mdash;  that said that it would work to provide an increased financial support package for social economy projects? That  commitment was forgotten; it is nowhere to be seen in Peter Robinson&rsquo;s  first Budget. I thank Mr Adams; the words that came from his mouth rang hollow  and have been proven false.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP has been  advised to go with the flow, so let us  consider what that means. It means that the children&rsquo;s fund no longer  exists; a cross-cutting strategy to deal with  children&rsquo;s issues in the North has been abandoned. Going with the flow  compounds the confusion around the 11-plus with financial uncertainty. There is  no Budget line whatsoever for the biggest reform of the education system for  decades. Let us go with the Sinn F&eacute;in flow, which fails to provide one word or  one pound of clarity on the single biggest issue that has concerned the  electorate over the past year &mdash; water charges. Let us go with the flow of a  Budget that has no Budget line for an anti-poverty strategy. Let other parties  go with the flow; the SDLP will go with its manifesto pledges and with its  responsibility to the electorate. It will  not go along with having its eye wiped by a Finance Minister who clearly  has the measure of Sinn F&eacute;in in Government and Sinn F&eacute;in Ministers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Gerry Adams berated the SDLP for voting down the Budget in  the Assembly but for voting in favour of it in the Executive. He asked how that  could be reconciled. In case Mr Adams has forgotten, it can be reconciled  because Mr Adams negotiated a facility for that with the DUP in the St Andrews and pre-St Andrews talks. Before St Andrews  and as far back as the negotiations at Leeds Castle,  Mark Durkan advised Peter Robinson that, because of the ministerial code, a  Minister would be compelled to vote for the Budget, but that did not compel the  party to do so. If Mr Adams fails to understand what the SDLP is doing, he  should ask his advisers because he signed up to that facility.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Ford: Given the number of occasions on which a  shared future and the cost of division have been referred to, I must start with  that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to address a point that was made by the Finance  Minister, and Trevor Lunn&rsquo;s response to it. I welcome the fact that &mdash; unlike  the First Minister &mdash; the Finance Minister has indicated that he is prepared to  engage seriously with us on the issues. We will happily take up his offer of a  meeting, because the Budget is too important to be simply dismissed with the  type of rhetoric that we hear in the Chamber.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There have been two types of speeches during the debate &mdash;  logical ones and illogical ones. There have been two types of opposition in the  Chamber &mdash; a coherent one and an incoherent one. Although I disagreed with many  of the speeches, at least some logical speeches were made by Members on the DUP  Benches. In all other parts of the Chamber &mdash; bar this small corner &mdash; Members  stood up and expressed their opposition to the Budget and the Programme for Government.  However, they then indicated their intention  to vote for it. Tonight, the SDLP may establish where it stands on the  issue, but where will the Sinn F&eacute;in and  Ulster Unionist Members who have expressed opposition stand on the issue when it comes to the vote?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It seems that Sinn F&eacute;in has not swallowed the Finance Minister&rsquo;s policies. There was some  traditional, old-fashioned, Marxist rhetoric from all manner of places.  I was particularly interested when Mitchel McLaughlin complained about PFIs.  There was a degree of irony in his saying that because the former Minister of  Education &mdash; the deputy First Minister &mdash; was sitting beside him at the time, and  he was the most principled supporter of PFIs. I do not know how Mitchel  McLaughlin could possibly have said that, but then Gerry Adams repeated exactly  the same points. We talk about coherence within parties, but there are clearly  major problems in Sinn F&eacute;in accepting its responsibilities in Government, as  opposed to its old-fashioned rhetoric.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Peter Weir is not in his place, but he took an interesting  line when he asked what we would do about school closures. The answer is  simple: school closures are happening  anyway, and they are happening in an incoherent way, because there is no  area-based planning. My colleagues have been prepared to take logical stances,  when necessary, to close unpopular schools, including a so-called integrated  school in the constituency of North Down,  where we took the realistic and honest solution. Therefore, we do not  need Peter Weir to give us lessons on that issue.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Simon Hamilton complained about funding for Irish-language  schools. I refer him to objective 4 of public service agreement 10 in the  Programme for Government, which he voted for yesterday &mdash; and I did not &mdash; which  gives a clear commitment to funding Irish-medium education. Therefore, if the  Member is going to point the finger, he should remember that there are three  fingers pointing back at him.</p>
	      <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Speaker in the Chair)</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is no realistic method for dealing with the fundamental issue of education reform in the  Programme for Government. There is nothing in the Budget to deal with the costs, which have been highlighted in  different corners of the Chamber,  and the importance of education reform.  How on earth will necessary reforms be carried through if they are not  mentioned in the Budget?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Health funding is rising, but it is still lower than other  regions of the UK,  despite the greater need. When Members discuss the Bamford Review, we must  recognise the fact that &pound;10 million is nowhere near adequate to address the  needs of mental health and learning disability. It is an insult for people to  pretend that &pound;10 million is, in any way, significant support. If we intended to  do something about mental health and learning  disability, a larger sum would be allocated for it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Issues have arisen in respect of the review of public administration and the need for reforms of local  govern&shy;ment, which, at this stage, have not been addressed.  The &pound;30 million that the Department of the Environment discussed for the  necessary restructuring and reforms of local government has disappeared  completely.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">To take the tough decisions that need to be taken requires  a coherent Executive with a clear vision. There may be a vision from the  Finance Minister, but it is not the coherent vision of this Executive, and it  is not a vision that carries across to some Members of his party. Even Mervyn  Storey &mdash; loyal mid-Bencher though he may be &mdash; managed to criticise it. I  thought that, at least, the Finance Minister would have his own party under  control. However, that is simply not the case. There are too many complaints,  and there is still too much to be done.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We will back an Executive if they have the courage to take  the right decisions, regardless of whether they are difficult or popular.  However, we did not support the Programme for Government yesterday, and we will  not support the Budget today, because they fail to deal with those issues. It  is time to recall this Budget and bring forward a Budget that meets the needs  of the people of Northern    Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">6.00 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">The Minister of Finance and Personnel (Mr P Robinson):  At the outset, I want to put one or two points on record.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">No Minister who comes to the Dispatch Box &mdash; regardless of  his or her responsibility &mdash; should feel undermined by concerns expressed by  colleagues, or by statements, such as that made by Mervyn Storey today, that a  Committee will pay special attention to certain areas. That is the job of  Committees; that is what I expect them to do. The Committees exist to keep  Ministers on their toes and to scrutinise properly. Those actions do not  undermine Ministers. Ministers are undermined when their party votes against  something that they voted for. We witnessed such an undermining of a Minister  during proceedings today and yesterday.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McNarry, Mr Adams and Brian Wilson raised a similar  point &mdash; though each from a different angle. They asked whether the Budget was  solid, or if it could ever be changed. It would be madness for any Finance  Minister to bring forward a Budget and say that it will stand for three years  and not be changed in any way. That would be a ludicrous position to adopt.  There will be changes in the environment and in how we have to do business over  the next three years. We will be required to look at different priorities, and  it will be the Executive&rsquo;s job to re-order  them; to look at what money is released in monitoring rounds; and to  consider the spending of any further funds  that we receive by way of asset  sales. I give a clear undertaking that the Executive will continue to  review and revise the Budget as necessary. Any responsible Executive would do  that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There was a tendency on the part of some Members to damn by  faint praise. Mr McNarry thought that the Budget was &ldquo;all right&rdquo;, and Brian  Wilson said that it was &ldquo;not bad&rdquo;. With such lavish praise, I am glad that  there were some more constructive contributions to the debate.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The debate was instructive. Opposing views were put forward  by Members, but, in most cases, the common purpose of Members was to make  Northern Ireland  a better place for all of our people. However, it is a matter of regret that,  in some cases, we witnessed continued opposition for opposition&rsquo;s sake.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In amendment No 1, the Alliance Party returns to the theme  of the cost of a divided society, presenting a shared future as the panacea for  all the financial challenges that the Executive will face. As I said in my  opening remarks, although I agree that we should exploit any potential from  that source, I have to deal in practical reality, and savings of the order  quoted are unobtainable in the short or medium term. Meanwhile, we must  continue with sensible and robust financial planning as a fundamental component  of the delivery of services.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Unlike the Alliance Party, my colleagues in the Executive  and I do not have the luxury of wishing our problems away. We have to deal, in  a mature and sensible way, with the real issues that face us. Without the bluff  that there is funding available from the source suggested by the Alliance Party &mdash; which can be picked up at any  moment &mdash; it is only through tax increases that the extra spend that the  Alliance Party advocates can be met. All Members know that if one was to cost  the Alliance Party&rsquo;s list of additional funding require&shy;ments, the regional  rate for every household in Northern    Ireland would have to be doubled or tripled.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">According to the Alliance Party&rsquo;s suggestion, domestic  regional rates will have to be increased by 76% to cover its proposals for  additional spending for health alone. In the build-up to future elections, I  hope that the Alliance Party members will go out and be as honest as they have  been with the Assembly today and state that they are a tax-and-spend party that  wants to double or triple the rates of the  people of Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP tabled an amendment. Even I was beginning to feel  sorry for the SDLP today: the party has been embarrassed. I am sure that my  information is correct. Right up to the weekend, if not beyond, the Minister  for Social Development expected her party to vote with her on the Programme for  Government, the investment strategy and the Budget.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It seems that, along the route, for some party-political  reason, a knee-jerk decision was taken to vote against the Budget and ditch the  Minister.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Durkan: I can assure the Minister that he has been  misinformed on that point. Our approach to this whole process, going back a  number of months, has been very clear, including the Minister for Social  Development&rsquo;s negotiating remit and priority focus.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr P Robinson: Having attempted to get an answer to  that question earlier, I am delighted to hear the Members&rsquo; remarks. I said that  there were only two alternatives: one was that members of the SDLP had shafted  their Minister, the other that the Minister had behaved disgracefully at the  Executive meeting. If she knew what her party&rsquo;s position was going to be, we  will come back to that and there will be ramifications.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP&rsquo;s representative did not table a single amendment  at any stage of the Executive&rsquo;s long consultation process or at the Executive  meeting at which the three documents were agreed. It is no answer for the  leader of the SDLP to tell Members that this is a democratic Assembly and that  &ldquo;this is where we do it&rdquo;. If one is a member of the Executive, that is where  one should first do it. Of course, if one does not get his or her way in the  Executive and decides &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Speaker: Order.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr P Robinson: In the course of the Executive meeting,  there was no amendment from the Social Development Minister &mdash; none whatsoever.  If these were die-in-the-ditch issues, of such importance to the SDLP that its  members were discussing them for weeks or months beforehand, it seems strange  that its Executive Minister &mdash; who is supposed to be a colleague &mdash; would not  have said at least, &ldquo;Hold on a second, lads and lassies, I have something that  is so important to the SDLP that if we do not get it we will vote against the  Programme for Government, the investment strategy and the Budget.&rdquo; In  circumstances of such fundamental importance to a party, it is a Minister&rsquo;s  duty to table an amendment. However, she did not &mdash; not a single amendment. It  is a disgrace that the Minister for Social Development allowed the Executive to  believe that we had resolved to her and her party&rsquo;s satisfaction all the issues  relating to the Programme for Government, the investment strategy and the  Budget. At no stage &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Durkan: Will the Member give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr P Robinson: Wait a moment; I have not finished with  the Member. He will have plenty of opportunities to speak.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">At no stage did the Minister for Social Development  indicate to the members of the Executive that the SDLP would vote against the  Budget, PFG or the investment strategy for Northern Ireland, nor did she  suggest any changes that might have made them satisfactory to her or her party  colleagues.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If the Executive is to work, every member of that Executive must be brought along at each stage of  dealing with issues. That is why I took the trouble to resolve  outstanding issues with Ministers who were unhappy about their draft Budget allocations and why I attempted to reach agreement with all the parties that are  represented on the Executive &mdash; not just my colleagues.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is my responsibility to ensure that all four parties are  moving along with the process. However, here we have one Minister who hid from  her Executive colleagues the fact that there was dissatisfaction of such a  magnitude that the whole wrath of the SDLP would come down on the three key  documents that represent the Executive&rsquo;s future strategy and policy.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Durkan: I thank the Minister for giving way; perhaps  he will be able to recover and prevent himself from going completely over the  top.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP tabled reasoned, measured amendments to both the  Programme for Government and, today, the Budget, and there was nothing over the  top or reckless about them. They are consistent with reservations that I  understand the Minister for Social Development expressed in the Executive, and if some of her Executive colleagues had joined her in expressing those  reservations she might have tabled an appropriate amendment. What was  there to do otherwise? The Assembly is the legal authority on the Budget, and  this is the proper place to table an amendment.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr P Robinson: That is an absurd comment for a former  Minister of Finance and Personnel to have made. What would he have thought if  he had worked on a Budget with his colleagues, but was not told at any stage  about key issues therein that needed to be changed until his Budget was debated  in the Assembly and thrown in his face? </p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">He is correct on one point: the issues that he mentioned  are not difficult to resolve. That is the reason that I must wonder why they  were never raised; many of them could have been explained to the Minister, had  she raised them, and they could also have been explained to the SDLP, had it  raised them during the consultation process. The SDLP chose not to raise those  issues because, for party political reasons, it wanted to ambush the Executive  when the Budget came before the Assembly.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member for Foyle should hang his head in shame over the  way in which he and his party have dealt with the issue. The SDLP has suggested  belatedly that uncertainties over water reform and post-primary education, the  standing-down of the children&rsquo;s fund, and the Budget allocation for health,  prevented it from supporting the Programme for Government yesterday and the  Budget today.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That list of excuses shows that the SDLP has been  scratching around for any possible reason to justify its opposition to the  Budget. Although it would have been preferable to have had all the issues that  are connected to water reform and post-primary education resolved neatly well  in advance of the Budget process, the leader of the SDLP knows &mdash; better than  most in the Chamber, given his time as Finance Minister &mdash; that that is not how it works. The Executive have to  undertake the strategic planning process on the basis of the best  information that is available at that time. That is the only sensible approach,  and it is the policy that he adopted when he was Finance Minister, and it is  also that which his Executive colleague, the Minister for Social Development,  endorsed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Other Members asked how a Budget could be considered when  the outcomes of the water review and the  educational reform programme &mdash; if that ever occurs &mdash; are unclear. At no  time in history has a Finance Minister been able to say that they know  everything that will happen three years in the future and can therefore work  out their Budget exactly. That will not happen;  there are always issues that need to be resolved.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Durkan: What about education?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Speaker: Order.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr P Robinson: The  Member asked about education. How can I possibly produce any costings  for education when I do not know what the reforms will be? The only alternative  is for me to postpone my Budget until I know. How many months or years would I  have to wait? I am required by law to produce a Budget in the time frame and in  the manner in which I have. Perhaps the Member for Foyle is suggesting that I  break the law; if I did, I might be with the Member for North Antrim Mr O&rsquo;Loan  being interrogated in Castlereagh Holding Centre, which is where he apparently  wants to go on holiday.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Had the Minister for Social Development and the SDLP considered matters further, many of the  concerns could have been resolved.  The Independent Water Review Panel&rsquo;s  strand-two report on water reform was published only yesterday. Given  that, how could I have taken that report into account when working on my  Budget? Ministers must now consider that report, and the Executive will have to  take a position on it. Before any final  decisions are made, the Executive&rsquo;s proposals will have to be subjected to public consultation in the  spring.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although post-primary admission arrangements are referred  to in the Budget document, the Minister of Education  is consulting with stakeholders on the details of her new proposal. Those will  also have to be brought to the Executive for consideration and decision.  If we waited for all the contentious issues to be resolved, there would not be  a Budget.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, the Northern Ireland Act 1998 places a duty on me, as Minister of Finance and Personnel,  to lay before the Assembly a draft  Budget before the beginning of each financial year. Officials in all  Departments have to carry out very considerable planning. Mature government is about considering proposals in the  current context while recognising the potential to review and amend as  the position changes. In-year monitoring processes can address those emerging  issues.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">6.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Concern has also been  expressed about the Executive&rsquo;s decision  not to allocate funding for a separate children&rsquo;s fund. There can be no doubt that investing in our  children, particularly at an early stage in their development, can yield  significant benefits for all society. The only question that the Executive have  to address is how that is best taken forward. The approach of the previous  Executive in ring-fencing the funding for children&rsquo;s services from raids by  other services had some merit. However,  that only meant that projects had less incentive to get up and running,  as has been shown by the significant levels of underspend for programme funds  more generally.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is little point in having children&rsquo;s funds if the  money cannot be spent, and is not being spent. Instead, this Executive have  agreed that the funding for the projects previously supported by central funds  should be included within departmental baselines, where those projects can be considered against competing  priorities, and where there is greater certainty regarding funding.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As far as the children&rsquo;s fund was concerned, there was an  underspend of 26.4% last year, whereas the average percentage underspend across  the Departments was about 2%. The Executive have decided that they should put  that funding into departmental baselines. It is also important to recognise  that the establishment of a children&rsquo;s fund now would require funding to be  removed from departmental baselines; and no Minister, including the Member&rsquo;s  own Minister requested that option.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, by having a cross-cutting public service  agreement on children and family, the Executive have recognised the importance  of Departments working together to provide improved outcomes rather than the  administration of a central fund.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Finally &mdash; with regard to the SDLP&rsquo;s amendment &mdash; the SDLP  returned to the issue of health funding, despite the Minister himself  recognising that the best outcome had been achieved in light of the current  financial situation. Members will be well aware that the Budget includes record  levels of investment in health and social-care services. However, the level of growth  in spending has been compared unfavourably by some with that of recent years.  In response, I would say that although spending was increasing at a faster rate  in the early part of the decade, so was Health Service inflation, in part, due  to the response to the increase in funding. The net result was a service in  which productivity was falling and waiting lists were rising. This year&rsquo;s  increases, of course, are on top of all of the previous increases.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Attwood: I am intervening now because I believe that  the Minister for Finance and Personnel is about to move on to broader themes.  He has made two very significant comments during the debate. He has conceded  that because he does not yet know what is going to happen with regard to  education reform and water charges, no budget lines &mdash; not even indicative  budget lines &mdash; have been arrived at. Does he not accept that over the next  month, in the event that significant financial consequences arise in respect of  water charges or Budget reform, that he will have to come back to the House and  rework the Budget in a way that could make it very different from what it is at  the moment?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, even though he does not know how much those  education or water reforms might cost, he said that those matters might be  addressed by in-year monitoring. If he does not know how much the reforms will  cost, how can he claim that in-year monitoring will produce sufficient funds  for Budget lines? There will be many other demands, and, as we know, the  Minister made provision in the December monitoring outcome for the health  budget.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If the Minister does not know how much policy reforms will  cost to implement, how can he say that in-year monitoring returns will cover  them? In the event that they do not, where will the Minister find the extra  money for water and education reforms?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr P Robinson: One would think that the Member had just  discovered the oracle. I have been involved in budgets at a local-government level for nearly 30 years. In not  one of those budget processes was I not aware of some significant initiative  that could arise in the future, but the  cost of which, at that stage, was not fully known. In those  circumstances, one makes the best stab at assessing what the likely  consequences will be.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Whatever the water reform issues might be, they must either  be dealt with through a reprioritisation of funding by the Department for  Regional Development or by the Executive as  a whole. In an in-year monitoring round, money can come from one  Department and be used by another. The commitment that I gave at the beginning  of this debate was that if there were issues that needed to be addressed, the  Executive would address those issues. The Executive cannot simply make a  decision on a matter that has cost implications unless they are satisfied that  they have the funds to meet the associated costs. The Executive must resolve  those issues before they can start the process of agreeing the policies.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">If there are funding implications, the Executive have to  consider how to deal with the resulting funding pressures. I cannot say what  the cost implications of the proposals on either water reform or education  reform will be. However, the normal processes of Government have been around  for generations and are capable of dealing with those types of pressures.  However, if high costs are involved and the relevant Departments cannot bear  those costs on their own, there will be consequences for other Departments.  That will always be the way. I imagine that that will be one of the factors  that the Executive will take into account before approving any such policy.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members will be aware that the Executive have no desire to  return to the failed dogma that states that more spending is the answer to  every problem that we face. Instead, we must focus on delivery and better ways  of providing services to ensure that outcomes are improved. I cannot accept  that the SDLP&rsquo;s arguments offer legitimate  reasons for not approving the Executive&rsquo;s Budget. As I have already  said, many Members &mdash; including, as has been pointed out, some of my own  colleagues &mdash; would prefer to see some changes in some of the spending areas for  one Department or another. It is inevitable that each of us will believe that a  particular area deserves more funding than is presently allocated.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, the decision that every Member must make is whether, to use the old Mo Mowlam  expression &mdash; in the round &mdash; one believes that the Budget is facing in  the right direction and that its trajectory will take the Executive forward. I  believe that it is facing in the right direction. My colleagues on the  Executive all believed that it is, and all of them voted, without reservation,  for the Budget. I trust that their colleagues will have sufficient faith in  their judgement to support what they agreed at Executive meetings.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I listened to the Minister for Social Development&rsquo;s  concerns during the consultation period on the draft Budget. When the issue was first raised in the Assembly, I said  that I was signed up to securing more funds for social development and housing.  I indicated how I believed that I could get those additional funds, and I  delivered more funds to the Minister for social housing. I must point out to  some Members that the funds that have been allocated for social housing will  not simply meet the targets that the Executive laid down in the Programme for  Government &mdash; they will exceed them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Those targets will be met, and the Minister for Social  Development agrees with me that if we reach the targets, we should not simply  consider that a good job has been done and that everyone can go home &mdash; we want  to exceed the targets by as much as possible. By providing the Minister with an  additional &pound;205 million, on top of the considerable amount of money that her Department received in the last two  monitoring rounds, the Executive have shown that they want to assist  her.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is regrettable that the SDLP chose to take its lead from  the Alliance Party. Simply to have its voice heard, it opposed the Programme  for Government and the Budget rather than joining the rest of the Executive in  trying to build a better future for the people of Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP leader was asked why no amendment was tabled in  the Executive, but I note that he has yet to provide an answer. In truth, no  answer could justify the steps taken by the SDLP yesterday and today. Ministers have a responsibility to inform their  Executive colleagues of any problems in their party and to seek changes  to meet those concerns.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Durkan: Where does that appear in the rules? The  Minister is proud of having renegotiated the ministerial code. However, as Alex  Attwood said and as I pointed out to the Finance Minister, his changes to the ministerial code bind Ministers but not their  parties, which is what he is trying to do now.<span class="Italic"> [Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Speaker: Order. It is important for a Member to  request that a Minister or Member give way.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr P Robinson: I have never suggested that a party is  bound by the action of its Minister. If any Minister with a genuine desire to  make the Executive work and to act for the benefit of the people of Northern  Ireland knows that his or her party has a problem that will cause it to vote against the Programme for  Government, the investment strategy and the Budget, the least that could be expected is that he or she informs the  Executive.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">No such rule or law exists, but anyone will consider it most peculiar that the Minister for Social  Development kept mum when she could have told her colleagues in the  Executive about a problem that it would be wise for them to address. I suspect  that the truth is that the Minister for Social Development thought that her  party would back her, and she is putting the bravest possible face on having  been badly let down.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr B McCrea: The  Minister said that it is important for ministerial colleagues to keep  him informed, and he described the difficulties in shaping a Budget when  certain facts are unknown to him. Would it have been helpful if the Minister of  Education had told him what she had planned &mdash; particularly plans to deliver a  fundamental change to the education system within the three-year period of the comprehensive spending review?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Would it be helpful if all his ministerial colleagues  brought him such information? In the absence of such information from the  Education Minister, should the Assembly delay the consideration of fundamental  changes to education until the next three-year period, by which time he will  have had time to gather all the relevant information?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr P Robinson: At this stage, it is impossible for me to cost any proposal from the Minister of Education.  Before her proposals come before my Department, she must present them to the  Executive, a consultation process must be carried out and her Department must  cost them. Until then, I do not know whether the Minister&rsquo;s budget alone, or in  conjunction with any additional funding that the Executive are willing to  provide, can meet the cost of her proposals. I do not even know whether the  proposals can receive the Executive&rsquo;s support, but that is a matter for them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Month after month, every Minister will have to deal with  new proposals; at no stage will a Minister have dealt with all the proposals in his or her remit. However, I accept that the proposal in question is of great  signifi&shy;cance and is, potentially, hugely expensive.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, I can work out a Budget only on the basis of the  funding pressures of which I am aware. I have done that. If new pressures  arise, clearly there will be decisions for the Executive to take.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">6.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Several Members raised  the issue about the reference to the &pound;1,000 that each household will  benefit from. I am not clear as to what type of mathematics they have engaged  in &mdash; they seem to think that there will be some difference in the &pound;1,000 if the  bills came through the door in the form of water charges. The figures that I  quoted were the distinction between what is planned by this Executive and what  would have happened had direct rule continued. Therefore, the reference to  &pound;1,000 took into account the fact that people would probably already have had two  bills for water charges had it not been for the decisions of the Executive.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, the Executive have already saved people very  considerable amounts of money compared to what they would have been paying in  water charges had direct rule continued. Furthermore, the percentages would  have increased with time in accordance with the legislation that was already  passed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Moreover, the Minister for Regional Development has already  indicated that people should not pay twice for their water. The Executive have  identified &mdash; and it has been accepted by the Consumer Council and others &mdash; that  the figure of &pound;162, or thereabouts, is the amount that had previously been paid  by consumers in their rates bill for water, and that the overall amount should  be reduced by that figure so that people are not asked to pay twice.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, that is what  gives rise to the fact that people will be &pound;1,000 better off as a result  of devolution. The Executive&rsquo;s decisions take into account water charges being  sent out according to the plans that the Executive already have in mind, but  also the fact that we are freezing rates for householders for the next three  years, whereas there had been an average of approximately a 10% per annum  increase under direct rule.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Those are the savings that make up the &pound;1,000. It is quite  simply a straightforward arithmetical calculation that I had hoped Members  would have been capable of understanding and accepting.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As Declan O&rsquo;Loan acknowledged, I have always been clear  that the saving is over a four-year period. However, it is still a substantial  saving and that money is much better in the hands or pockets of the people of Northern Ireland,  rather than supporting inefficiency across the public service.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A number of Members, including Stephen Farry, Declan O&rsquo;Loan and Roy Beggs, raised issues  concerning economic policies. Comments have been made about the  appropriateness of existing economic policies and the relevance of regional  targets. Let us be clear: existing economic policies that are driven by a direct rule mindset will, at best, ensure that the  Northern Ireland economy will continue to languish at around 80% of  the UK  average. That is simply unacceptable.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We need to examine our suite of economic policies and  invest further in only those programmes that will enhance our regional  productivity. Investing in the four key drivers of enterprise, innovation,  skills and infrastructure will be the key determinant for agreeing investment. Measuring our regional performance  against the south-east England  financial powerhouse is pointless. We have defined the PSA targets to  allow us to better gauge relative  performance against the other UK  regions.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Improved performance will not appear overnight; it will be  a slow and gradual process. However, the Executive are determined to reach the  targets that have been set. Bringing about such improvement is why I accepted  the offer from the Chief Secretary to the Treasury for a second Varney Review.  An external objective assessment of our economic policies and needs can only be  helpful.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I strongly encourage my Executive colleagues, the Assembly  Committees and Members to fully engage with Sir David Varney over the next four  weeks during the consultation period. We  need complete clarity on what direction our economy is required to take.  Therefore, we need complete clarity on the policies that must be implemented.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Issues were raised by, among others, Mitchel McLaughlin,  the Chairperson of the Committee for Finance and Personnel, and by Declan  O&rsquo;Loan and Roy Beggs, regarding the regional economic strategy. The new regional economic strategy will be  significantly influenced by the second Varney Review as well as the  decisions that have been taken by the Executive in respect of the Programme for Government, the investment strategy  and the Budget.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I take no comfort from pointing out that I have always  urged caution in managing expectations when trying to obtain any tax  dispensation, and many of us were disappointed by the attitude taken in the  first Varney Review.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, the second Varney study will provide an objective  assessment of what our economy needs by way of development policies and  programmes. I am glad to say that that review will have some of our in-house officials involved, and there will,  therefore, be a greater degree of  local expertise going into the process.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Chairperson of the Committee for Finance and Personnel and Mr O&rsquo;Loan raised concerns about PFIs  and PPPs. Such contracts can only be put in place if they represent  robust value for money in business cases and if  they are affordable as regards departmental allocations.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Additional funding for  youth services was mentioned, and I would like to point out to Jennifer  McCann of West Belfast that in response to the  call for public consultation for additional funding for children and youth services, the Executive have allocated an  additional &pound;13 million across the Budget period. The Minister of  Education has used that money to allocate an extra &pound;4&middot;6 million to current  expenditure on youth services.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Jennifer McCann also mentioned social housing and the  affordability review. Across the three-year Budget period, the Department for  Social Development has been given the resources to deliver 2,000, 2,250 and 2,500 social and affordable houses each year  respectively. To complement the Semple  Review, Baroness Margaret Ford was  commissioned by Margaret Ritchie to undertake a review of funding  capacity, planning policy and delivery  structures for social housing in Northern Ireland. I welcome  the Minister&rsquo;s initiative and the interim report by Baroness Ford, which I have  seen. The Minister will consider the issues emerging from the report of her  advisory panel, which is examining the Semple Report, and will report back to  the Executive.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Efficiency targets were mentioned by a number of Members, including  Stephen Farry, Declan O&rsquo;Loan and David McNarry. Some commentators have  expressed concerns about the deliverability of the 3% efficiency targets, and I  agree that that issue is important.  Departments will soon be setting out detailed plans on their  departmental websites showing how they will deliver against the targets, the  key risks to delivery, and the associated contingency plans. That work will provide assurance, and will facilitate  scrutiny of the delivery plans by Assembly Committees. Rather than doubt  whether 3% can be attained, there should be pressure to try to go beyond 3%.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There seems to be confusion and concern that the efficiency  agenda presents a risk to front-line services. The whole point of the  efficiency agenda is to release funds specifically  for reallocation to front-line services, not to take them away. Although  it is for individual Departments to deliver those savings, Departments can come back to the Executive to seek support and  assistance in the event that circumstances mean that delivery of efficiencies in any year will not be possible. I  emphasise the point that the responsibility is on the Executive, as a  whole, to deliver the targets set out in the Programme for Government.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">David McNarry and Roy  Beggs mentioned the question of funding for a national stadium. I assure  them that I will take the decision in the Department of Finance and Personnel  and inform my Executive colleagues, and it will be based entirely on the  evidence presented in the business case. The key driver for that decision will be demonstrable value for money and  affordability, and it is only right  that the business case should embrace all  the cost factors. I assure the Member for East Antrim Mr Beggs that  infrastructure, and other associated costs, will not be ignored when value for  money and affordability are being considered.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">David McNarry and Alan McFarland referred to the  Chancellor&rsquo;s package. It seems ironic that Mr McNarry should raise the issue of  the package, since he and his party had given up  on it before devolution and had advised my colleagues to move on to  devolution and leave the issue behind. If it had been left to them, we would  still be stuck with the reinvestment and reform initiatives and borrowing  conditions that would have required huge annual regional rate increases. I am  glad that we managed to get that changed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We should not underestimate the scale of what we have  achieved, especially in the wider UK public expenditure context in  which the package was secured. Although we would have liked to have achieved  more &mdash; and what Executive would not? &mdash;  negotiations with the Treasury have  paid dividends. The Member for North Down said that we promised a &pound;1  billion package and that we had failed to  deliver. He is right; we have failed to deliver a &pound;1 billion package &mdash;  we have delivered a package that is worth more than &pound;2 billion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Some Members: Hear, hear.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr P Robinson: As a result of the negotiations, we  delivered guaranteed &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">A Member: Where is it?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr P Robinson: The Member asks, &ldquo;where is it?&rdquo;. If he  looks at the investment strategy, he will see where it is. We have &pound;2 billion a  year in capital expenditure, because we are using the benefits that we could  derive from the package, benefits that came  from our ability &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr B McCrea: Will the Member give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr P Robinson: The Member should let me make the case  before he intervenes. Indeed, he might choose not to intervene when he hears  the case made.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Previously, money that was gained by way of asset disposal  found its way back to the Treasury and, at the very least, we ended up having  to argue for it or some part of it. We would never have been able to argue for  the scale of asset disposal funding that we have been able to allocate in Northern Ireland.  We have already been able to identify approximately &pound;1&middot;1 billion for the next  three years. The capital realisation task force has identified another &pound;295  million over that period, and I have allocated only &pound;200 million in the  provisions of the Budget. Therefore, there will be some room to manoeuvre  should there be issues about the price of land that some Members referred to or  other pressures that we might face.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Does the Member want me to give way now?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr B McCrea: I will ask a simple question on behalf of  the people of Northern    Ireland. If we have received the &pound;2 billion,  why do we all feel so poor? Why is the man in the street worried about the  price of diesel, the price of food and other prices? The whole issue &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span><span class="B3BodyTextItalicChar"><span style="font-size:11.0pt; "> </span></span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members can laugh, but I want to ask them a question. Does  the Northern Ireland  public feel that it has been given a fair deal?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr P Robinson: I can confirm that I have no intention  of allocating funds to a subvention for restaurants or the local grocery shop.  The amount of capital funds available for the last comprehensive spending  review period was &pound;600 million per annum. We now have &mdash; and I will speak in  language that the Member might understand &mdash; &pound;2,000 million &mdash; well over three times  the previous allocation, and that was due to the provision of the Chancellor&rsquo;s  package. It was a massive bonus for the Executive.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In addition to the amount that we have gained from asset  sales, we have had access over the Budget period to our full stock of end-year  flexibility funding, and that has amounted to some &pound;440 million. We have access  to unused RRI borrowing, which is worth a further &pound;100 million. As I have  already said, breaking the link between access to borrowing under RRI, with the  requirement to close the gap with GB council-tax rates, has been a massive  benefit to the Executive and has allowed me to ensure that we did not have the  19% rate increases that the policy that the Member for Foyle introduced as part  of his party&rsquo;s allocation for RRI &mdash;<span class="Italic"> [Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I would love to tell the story of my visit to the Member  when he was Finance Minister, when I advised against breaking the link between  our regional rate and water charging, and the consequences of that change.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Speaker: Order.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">6.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr P Robinson: I have only 15 or 20 minutes left, and  by the look of the number of the pages that I have still to read, I am less  than halfway through, so I had better speak quickly.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Today, it is the Executive and the Assembly who determine  the level of rate increases in Northern Ireland,  not local government in Great    Britain.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McNarry also raised the issue of the number of  Departments that various parties hold and, therefore, how important those  parties are and how far they can puff out their chests. He boasted about the  size of the budgets of the two Departments  that his party colleagues hold. Let me just tell him that size is not  everything. The size of the Budget is not the key determinant in these issues.  The quality of services that will be delivered to the people of Northern Ireland  is what matters, rather than what those services cost.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Alliance Party accused us of having a low-tax Budget. I  am unapologetic about the reduction in rates for households and businesses.  Industrialised countries across the world have recognised that supply-side  policies, such as low taxation, are the key mechanisms for improving economic  growth. I was surprised that Stephen Farry quoted the CBI and ERINI as though  they were supporters of his, because they have been at the forefront of the call for reductions in corporation tax.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member for North Antrim Mr Storey raised the issue of  reform costs. Although the programme of Civil Service reform, including  Workplace 2010, must receive an appropriate level of funding over the Budget period, the level of costs required has not been  finalised yet. Therefore, it would not have been appropriate to allocate  all the funding at this time, in light of the competing priorities and  pressures. That will also incentivise the programmes to minimise cost and  maximise efficiencies.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The issue of procurement and poverty was raised by Jennifer  McCann and Sammy Wilson, although I am not sure that they were both singing off  exactly the same hymn sheet. The Executive have a statutory requirement to adopt an anti-poverty strategy.  Ministers are committed to making people&rsquo;s lives better by tackling  poverty and social exclusion. Those principles underpin the Executive&rsquo;s  Programme for Government.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I remain convinced that the most effective way to alleviate  poverty is to create employment and enhance regional economic growth and, in  parallel, to increase spending on public services. That is what this Budget  does. Although it is important that the Executive do all that they can to  reduce the unacceptably high level of poverty in Northern Ireland, it must be  recognised that using Government procurement as a tool to address poverty may  result in lower levels of value for money, with an associated impact on  services that are provided to the public.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Declan O&rsquo;Loan raised the issue of the Department of  Finance&rsquo;s efficiencies. Over the CSR period, my Department will take forward  the most wide-ranging reform of public services that has been seen for a  generation. At the heart of that reform programme is a commitment to developing  world-class public services that will not  only support the needs of the economy, but bring benefits to the wider  society in Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Delivering efficiency within public services is central to  both the Programme for Government and the Budget over the next three years. As  I have already said, I have established a performance and efficiency delivery  unit to examine the scope for Departments, including my own, to deliver savings  over and above the 3% target for this Budget. More than 40% of the funding that  is allocated to my Department over the CSR period is required to support the  delivery of the key Northern Ireland Civil Service reform programmes on behalf  of all the Northern Ireland Civil Service Departments.<span class="Italic"> [Interruption.]</span><span class="B3BodyTextItalicChar"><span style="font-size:11.0pt; "> </span></span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Speaker: Order,  Members. A number of meetings seem to be going on in the Chamber.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr P Robinson: If Members are reconsidering the  decisions that they have taken in the past, they can continue with their  discussions, and, hopefully, some sense will come from them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The process of benefits realisation associated with the  reform programmes will extend beyond the CSR period  as projects are implemented and service delivery is stabilised.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Consequently, qualitative and quantitative value-for-money  savings are expected to materialise over the longer  term. Against that backdrop, the efficiency target of &pound;14 million by  2010-11 represents a significant challenge. Despite that, my Department has  identified, and is committed to delivering, efficiencies of at least &pound;14&middot;8  million by 2010-11, thereby finding savings that are 5% above the set target.  Of the total efficiencies identified by 2010-11, &pound;5&middot;7 million &mdash; or 38&middot;5% &mdash;  relate to the recognition of income associated with recouping the cost of  collection of district rates on behalf of district councils, thereby generating  &pound;5&middot;7 million of additional resource cover for investment in services across the  Northern Ireland block, and thus it represents a legitimate cash-releasing  savings action.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The issue of funding for the arts was raised by several  Members. The Executive recognise fully the role played by arts and sports in  society, as is shown by the additional &pound;4  million allocation to the Department of  Culture, Arts and Leisure, in response to the concerns raised during the  public consultation process on the draft Budget. The matter of the libraries  was also drawn to our attention.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, although we recognise the case for additional funding for the arts, it is important to note  that spending comparisons quoted liberally during the public consult&shy;ation  significantly understate the current position as regards arts funding in Northern Ireland.  In particular, alternative figures, from the official Treasury source, suggest that funding for the arts is on a par, if  not higher, than in England,  while sports funding is significantly higher. Therefore, I am confident that  the increased provision for arts funding, agreed by the Executive in the  revised Budget, will allow the people of Northern Ireland to enjoy the same  benefits in that respect as the rest of the  people of the United Kingdom. The proposed allocation will enable the  implementation of the sport and physical  recreation strategy, although the Department of Culture, Arts and  Leisure will need to make some difficult decisions with regard to its  priorities.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The issue of funding for the Office of the First Minister  and deputy First Minister was raised by the Member for East Antrim Mr Beggs.  The increase in funding for that office since the previous period of devolution  is mainly due to the provision of more services, rather than to an increase in  bureaucracy. Since 2002-03, an additional &pound;5 million has been spent on victims;  that will rise to &pound;13 million by 2010-11. An additional &pound;2 million is required  for the ongoing running costs of the office of the Northern Ireland Commissioner for  Children and Young People, which was not in place under the previous Executive.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to support for the Executive spending area, the  majority of additional costs relate to the Strategic Investment Board and the  reinvestment and reform initiative.  Although I encourage all my ministerial colleagues to keep costs as low  as possible, I hope that Members agree that  the services provided by OFMDFM for children, victims, older people and  community relations are of significant benefit to the people of Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Beggs: Will the Minister give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr P Robinson: I would love to give way, but I have so  little time left that, by bringing Mr Beggs in for a second or third time, I  will not cover another Member for a first time.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, I will deal with a point that he raised in  relation to the capital realisation report. The excellent work of Ed Vernon and  the capital realisation task force identified the potential for &pound;290 million  asset disposal over the Budget period. As I indicated, I have not allocated all  that potential funding, but rather have adopted a prudent assumption over the  Budget period. A key issue to be considered before any disposal is taken  forward is the state of the market. In that way, we will ensure that we secure  the maximum value of all disposals. I assure the Member that there will be no  fire sale of assets while I am Minister of Finance and Personnel. Consideration  is being given to the publishing of the capital realisation task force report.  At present, it is with the Executive, where further decisions have yet to be  taken.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The issue of road structural maintenance was raised by Fred  Cobain. I found his contribution to be rather Jekyll and Hyde in nature: while  he read his script as Chairperson of the  Committee for Regional Development, he made positive and constructive  points; while he read his own script, he was in orbit and made some comments  that were neither rational nor factual. The Budget allocation for structural  maintenance will allow Roads Service to give priority to maintenance of the  strategic road network, which carries the greatest volume of traffic. Other  roads, including rural roads, will receive resurfacing treatment as far as the  Budget allocation will permit.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A system of regular safety inspections is in place to  ensure that essential response maintenance is identified and completed when  necessary. The outcome of the final Budget means that funding for roads  structural maintenance will total &pound;200 million during the Budget period. I can  assure all Members that that spending area  can, of course, be augmented if in-year monitoring rounds identify  additional funding and the Executive consider that an appropriate priority.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Fred Cobain also referred to railways. Translink now has  the resources to procure 20 additional new trains, the first of which will be  in service in 2011. It will also be able to construct a new railway station in Newry, secure some &pound;40 million of track  improvements between Knockmore and Lurgan, as well as completion of the  &pound;12 million track extension between Ballymena and Coleraine, and take forward a  major track relay between Coleraine and Londonderry.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In respect of health efficiency, the Chairperson of the  Health Committee, the Member for Strangford Iris Robinson MP MLA &mdash; with whom,  as you would expect, Mr Speaker, I agree entirely &mdash; pointed out that the Budget  package for health represents a golden opportunity for the Health Minister to  deliver further efficiency savings beyond the 3% target. It provides him with  much greater flexibility. Of course, any efficiency savings that are made will  go to front-line services.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the work of the Bamford Review of mental health  and learning disability. I am sure that all Members want improved services for  patients in that sector. The additional allocations in the revised Budget for  2008-11, along with a package of measures to provide greater financial  flexibility, will enable the Department of Health to cover its substantial cost  pressures as well as a series of service developments during the Budget period. That will include improvements to  mental-health and learning-disability services.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member for Upper Bann Sam Gardiner referred to the  environmental protection agency. No decision has been made about the  establishment of such an agency in Northern Ireland, which was  proposed in the report of the review of environmental governance. I understand  that the Environment Minister is carefully considering  her approach to environmental governance. In doing so, she is taking account of the recommendations of the independent review of environmental  governance report, of resource and wider policy considerations, and of  points that stakeholders have raised with her and the Department.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member for West Tyrone Barry McElduff referred to  additional resource allocations. He pointed out that they would enable the Department  of Culture, Arts and Leisure to allocate additional funds to areas that he and  I consider important, such as sport and physical recreation. I believe that  around &pound;11&middot;5 million has been allocated to commence the implementation of the  Department&rsquo;s sports and physical recreation strategy, which focuses on  increasing participation in sport, particularly by young people.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member also referred to the fuel duty differential. In  recent years, the fuel duty differential has converged considerably. It is also  welcome that law-enforcement officers in  the border area have seized around 11 million litres of illicit fuel,  dismantled 93 laundering plants, disrupted 19 criminal gangs who were involved  in oil fraud, and secured 31 convictions for oil fraud offences. That occurred  between April 2000 and March 2006.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Adams pointed out to Members on these Benches that there  were issues that they might want to consider, such as the denial of fiscal  flexibility that comes with Northern Ireland  being part of the United Kingdom.  I must point out to him that there are significant benefits from Northern Ireland being part of the United Kingdom,  particularly the fact that its deficit, which is in the region of &pound;7 billion  per annum, is funded by the Treasury. That amounts to around &pound;9,400 for each  member of the population of Northern    Ireland. Therefore, if the Assembly were to  consider that purely on financial terms, it would not make any changes.  However, for many Members, the reasons for staying in the United Kingdom  go well beyond the issue of finance.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">7.00 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I will touch on the issue of microgeneration, which the  Member for North Down Mr Brian Wilson raised. For many buildings, certain  microgeneration technologies will simply not be appropriate; for example, wind  turbines or solar panels in a shaded hollow, or wood-pellet heating systems  where there is insufficient space in which to store pellets. Therefore, it  makes no sense to mandate designers to use them. Improving the thermal  performance of a building is widely recognised as the most cost-effective means  of reducing emissions. Mandatory microgeneration would force designers to use a  more expensive technology to achieve the same results.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I think that it was the same Member who tabled some  questions for written answer on that subject. Rather than take up further time  now, I can tell him that he got an extensive response, which he may have  already received, to those questions. Papers have been placed in the Library as  a result of inaccurate stories on the issue that were printed, particularly in  &lsquo;The Irish News&rsquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank all Members who spoke today and who have put  forward their views throughout the Budget process. I regret that, due to time  constraints, it has not been possible to respond to each issue that each Member  has raised during the course of the debate. However, I hope that the main  themes have been addressed. I am sure that we will return to many of them in  future debates on financial matters.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members have raised a number of important issues, not only  for the Executive to consider as we move forward but for individual Departments  and their Committees to consider. Although I may have fundamentally disagreed  at times with a position that has been advanced, that should not be mistaken  for any lack of desire on my behalf, or on that of my Executive colleagues, to  hear differing views on the proposed priorities and their associated spending  plans.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The debate throughout the Budget process was at times robust, but there can be no doubt that the  public&rsquo;s views have been made known. The Executive have listened to  those views, and the result is an improved set of Budget proposals. In that  context, I agree with the &lsquo;Belfast Telegraph&rsquo; editorial on the revised Budget,  which stated:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;when it comes to putting government money where it is  most needed, there is no substitute for devolution.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That is not to say that any devolved Budget would  be good enough for the people of Northern Ireland &mdash; we have done  much better than that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Budget is a Budget for households, because it reduces regional rates; for business, because it  increases levels of support, particularly for innovation activity; for  public services, because it provides record levels of investment; and for all  the people of Northern Ireland, because it puts in place a comprehensive  strategy to deliver real improvements to local people&rsquo;s lives.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although the Executive&rsquo;s spending plans must be kept under review, I am confident that we have a  strong starting position for the next three years. Therefore, I recommend to all Members that they support the  Budget and do not pander to any party political advantage.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Some Members: Hear, hear.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Speaker: Order, Members.</p>

	      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly approves the programme of expenditure  proposals for 2008-09 to 2010-11 as set out in the Budget laid before the  Assembly on 22 January 2008.</p>
	      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="4"></a>Private Notice Question</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Water Supply at Killyclogher</p>
	      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion"><strong>Mr </strong>McElduff&nbsp;asked the Minister for  Regional Development to outline the work being undertaken by his Department to  repair the water infrastructure near Killyclogher; and to ensure that the  hundreds of families affected are reconnected to the public water supply.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">The Minister for Regional Development (Mr Murphy): I  have been advised by Northern Ireland Water that no families are currently  affected by the loss of water supply due to the burst water main in the  Killyclogher area, and none require reconnection to the public water supply.  All customers are being supplied from adjacent water supply zones.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText"><span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Speaker: Order. Members should leave the Chamber in  an orderly fashion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Murphy: I am surprised that there is not more  interest in this matter.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Northern Ireland Water has isolated the section of damaged  pipe and contingency plans have ensured that water supplies have been secured.  The location of the breach has made the repair technically difficult and  potentially hazardous. The difficult ground conditions have caused the pipe  failure to recur at the same location, and Northern Ireland Water has engaged  specialist structural engineers to provide advice on the best long-term  solution and on the necessary preliminary works to ensure that the repair can  be carried out with the minimum risk to health and safety.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The focus remains on repairing the damage as quickly as  possible while managing the present technical and safety considerations. At the  same time, the re-zoning allows water supplies to be brought in from other  areas and has allowed Northern Ireland Water to continue to provide customers  with water supplies.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">7.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr McElduff: Ba mhaith liom mo bhu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il  leis an Aire as ucht a fhreagra. I thank the Minister for his answer and for  accepting the private notice question. I welcome the assurance that no families  are currently affected by a loss of supply. I appreciate the efforts of those  carrying out the work in that area, on what are poor ground conditions.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">How many calls did NI Water receive between Thursday 24  January and the evening of Sunday 27 January? Will the Minister detail the  nature of the work being undertaken to provide a long-term solution?  Furthermore, will the Minister give an assessment of the short-term risk of a  possible recurrence of the problem?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName">Mr Murphy: I appreciate the difficulties that have been  caused for the people of Omagh. As I have said, no one is currently without a  water supply. Of course, the people in the affected area will want some degree  of certainty of future water supplies and of the continuity of that water  supply.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">On Thursday 24 January when the incident initially  occurred, approximately 200 calls were received by Northern Ireland Water&rsquo;s  customer relations centre between 4.30 pm and midnight. On the evening of  Friday 25 January when the problem reoccurred, approximately 250 calls were  received as the initial re-zoning exercise to supply the area from adjacent supplies  proved not to be extensive enough. On Sunday 27 January, approximately 20 calls  were received between 10.00 pm and midnight when the initial attempt to repair  and recharge the main was unsuccessful.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As the Member said, the terrain around where the leakage  occurred is difficult to work on. It was a landslide that dislodged one section  of the pipe from the other. The ability of Northern Ireland Water&rsquo;s engineers  to successfully carry out the repair was hindered by the ground and weather  conditions, which caused difficulties and created health and safety issues for  the operatives.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">They made the connections to replace the water supply from  other sources. As I have said, initially that did not suffice, but it was  rectified and has sufficed since. It is the intention of Northern Ireland Water  to repair the landslide that caused the initial leakage as soon as possible and  to have all of the properties reconnected to the supply from Killyclogher.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Adjourned at 7.48 pm.</p>
