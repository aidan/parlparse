                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to advise Members of the arrangements
                being made to pay tribute to the exceptional service of the Fire
                Service over the last thirty years. The Fire Authority will
                strike a medal that will be awarded to all fire fighters having
                at least three years’ continual service with good conduct;
                this includes service between 1969 and 2000. Other brigade staff
                with five years’ service, which includes service within this
                period, will be presented with a medallion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first award ceremony will take place in
                the Great Hall, Parliament Buildings, later in the summer, when
                I will present the first awards to a number of firefighters and
                brigade support staff. Fire-fighting is very dangerous work, and
                it is to be regretted that many firefighters have been injured,
                and a number have lost their lives while protecting the public
                and trying to save property. Many people owe their lives to the
                courage and skill of our firefighters and the important
                contribution of brigade support staff. I am sure that all
                Members will agree with me that the award of these medals and
                medallions is well-deserved recognition for this vital work.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Lewsley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I commend the Minister for recognising the
                work of the Northern Ireland Fire Brigade by awarding this
                medal. It is most appropriate given the low morale over recent
                months and the fact that over the last 30&nbsp;years the Fire
                Service has provided an excellent service and shown a commitment
                to the community throughout the troubles, sometimes putting
                their own lives at risk. Would the Minister agree that given
                that public safety is at the core of this issue, there is a need
                to redress the balance to bring the local fire brigade numbers
                into line with the services in the rest of the UK? Considering
                the size and the population of Northern Ireland, it would also
                be beneficial if the Fire Service were to receive a significant
                increase in funding to enable it to increase its recruitment
                programme to provide adequate coverage in all areas in the North
                of Ireland.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms de Brún:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Member’s tributes for the
                Fire Service. It is to be understood that the fire brigade here
                is a labour-intensive organisation with over 900&nbsp;whole-time
                and over 900 part-time firefighters. The target establishment
                for the whole-time firefighters is 919 personnel, 899 of whom
                are in post, leaving a shortfall of 20. The target establishment
                for part-time firefighters is 980, and 917 are in post which is
                a shortfall of 63. Those are comprehensive numbers in terms of
                staffing levels here. Following the comprehensive spending
                review in 1999, additional moneys were allocated to the Fire
                Service. The moratorium on recruitment was, therefore, able to
                be lifted. Twenty-five additional firefighters were recruited in
                August&nbsp;1999, and a further 25&nbsp;recruits had their
                passing-out parade only last week. The fire authority is
                experiencing difficulty in recruiting part-time firefighters,
                but its preference is to recruit part-time firefighters on a
                24-hour call-out basis.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In terms of the question the Member asked
                about money and investment, the Fire Authority baseline budget
                allocation has risen, and this is significant. It has risen from
                £43·7&nbsp;million in 1998/99 to £51·4&nbsp;million for
                2000/01. An additional £4·9&nbsp;million was allocated last
                year, which is an increase of £8·5&nbsp;million in real terms.
                The £51·4&nbsp;million allocation for this year represents an
                increase of £2·9&nbsp;million over the 1999/00 allocation,
                representing a 3% increase in real terms.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have also seen modernisation and
                improvement in the standard of fire services, which is being
                pursued through the development and efficient maintenance of a
                fire brigade fleet and fire-fighting equipment. The comparative
                cost of fire services in England for 1999/00 was £30,024, in
                Wales it was £32,055 and here it was £26,654, so there are
                significant comparisons.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Paisley Jnr:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of course it does not take a statement from
                an IRA/Sinn Féin Minister to get Members on this side of the
                House to congratulate the Fire Service for their sterling work
                in preserving property, life and limb from fire and danger in
                this society over the last decades. Can the Minister confirm to
                the House how many fires the Fire Service has had to attend and
                put out as a result of Provisional IRA bombs? What has been the
                cost to the Fire Service in terms of manpower and resources in
                dealing with such bomb attacks and tackling fires caused by
                terrorism in Northern&nbsp;Ireland?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Did the Minister, when meeting the Fire
                Service, apologise to it for the years of bomb attacks that
                placed the lives of firemen in jeopardy because of the
                activities of members of her party? Has she called on her
                community to cease from stoning and attacking firemen and
                stopping them from doing their duty? Should the Minister not be
                embarrassed by coming to this House and announcing an award to a
                Fire Service that her party tried to expunge from existence in
                Northern Ireland?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms de Brún:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is not possible to disaggregate those
                fires and other incidents that the Fire Service has attended
                over the last 30 years which specifically emanated from the
                conflict or from any section of the community from those which
                occurred for other reasons. We can all recite specific incidents
                which occurred in the course of the conflict over the past 30
                years and engage in pointing the finger of blame. I had hoped
                that today would not be about political point-scoring. That is
                certainly not my intention, and I hope that Members will not
                wish to engage in that either. Today we give due recognition to
                the Fire Service’s labour for all sections of the community
                throughout the period, often at great personal risk to its
                members.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Neeson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I sincerely welcome the Minister’s
                statement. The awards are long overdue, given the Fire Service’s
                bravery over the years of the troubles. Even now its members are
                being attacked on the streets by all sides. This is not the time
                for making political statements. Rather we should be thankful
                for this announcement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I ask the Minister to give serious
                consideration to reviewing existing Fire Service provision
                throughout Northern Ireland, bearing in mind that, in recent
                times, there has been a significant population growth in a
                number of areas which still only have part-time firemen and
                facilities. The time has now come for full-time Fire Service
                provision to be made in these areas.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms de Brún:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Member for his kind words which I
                shall ensure are passed on to the Fire Service. It is fitting
                today that we give recognition to the Fire Service. We all wish
                it well in the work that it is carrying out today, just as we
                wish those well who have carried out such work over the past 30
                years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have given some details of significant
                investment in existing provision. I should be happy to write to
                the Member if he wishes to raise specific areas with me where it
                is felt that existing provision should be altered.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thank you, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I too
                welcome the Minister’s statement and concur with those who
                have pointed out that this is not an occasion for political
                point-scoring. We have met members of the Fire Service Union
                and, indeed, the Fire Authority itself on several occasions, and
                those meetings were extremely amicable.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the health authority we have spoken about
                the integration of the Fire Service and the Ambulance Service.
                Would the Minister like to comment on that? Does the Minister
                recognise the need for North/South co-operation between the fire
                brigades? Have any formal arrangements been put in place for
                this?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is already good co-operation between
                the Fire Service and the Ambulance Service in training and
                communications. The inclusion of responsibility for fire and
                ambulance services under a single Department will, of course,
                now provide greater opportunities for increased co-operation and
                efficiency, including joint training and the sharing of premises
                for vehicles. I also expected it to lead to the development of a
                common communications infrastructure and joint approaches to the
                provision of information to the public about access to public
                safety.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to North/South co-operation, the
                Fire Service maintains a good working relationship with brigades
                in the South. There is a formal arrangement with Donegal County
                Council in which the Fire Service provides fire and emergency
                cover for East Donegal. The cost of doing so is a retainer of
                £3,500 per annum and a charge of £195.50 per appliance per
                call out. Cross-border protocols exist between local fire
                stations also in terms of responding to emergencies. Contacts
                have been established with the Dublin Fire Brigade for joint
                training initiatives and for considering questions of, for
                example, advanced technology. There is ongoing co-operation
                therefore. As part of their fleet replacement programme, smaller
                fire brigades in the South purchase some of the Fire Service’s
                older appliances that have become surplus to requirements.</p>

                proposals that have been under consideration for some time in
                terms of the recognition for firefighters. The type of award
                that was to be brought forward had been discussed between
                members of the Fire Service Past Members’ Association and
                previous Ministers with responsibility for the Fire Service. I
                have not yet given any consideration to further awards, or other
                forms of awards. I think we need to mark quite clearly our
                regret that nine firefighters lost their lives, and that
                hundreds of firefighters were injured in the last 30&nbsp;years.

                firefighters had lost their lives as a result of the troubles.

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I must point out to the Member that I did not
                say that. I pointed out that nine firefighters had lost their
                lives over the last 30 years. It is not possible to disaggregate
                figures into those who lost their lives in the conflict and
                those who lost their lives fighting fires in other
                circumstances. I have therefore stated clearly that I note not
                only that firefighters have lost their lives, but that hundreds
                of others have been injured fighting fires. It is not for the
                Department to try to disaggregate the causes of those fires. My
                wish today is to pay tribute to the firefighters’ service, and
                it is a source of regret to me that firefighters have been
                injured or lost their lives in carrying out this tremendous
                work.</p>

                long-overdue award for those who have served in the Fire
                Service. We all agree on the tremendous, sterling work that they
                have done, especially in the difficult circumstances of the last
                30 years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to question the Minister further
                about some of the statements that she has made. Surely it must
                be possible to have these figures disaggregated. Whether or not
                it is possible, she may not wish to do it now, but it must
                surely be possible to have figures supplied on who was
                responsible for arson and bomb attacks over the years. At the
                very least, the Chief Constable issues certificates on many of
                these attacks, so the information will be on record.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Further to the previous question, instead of
                obscuring the issue of who was responsible for particular
                deaths, will the Minister take the opportunity now —
                regardless of which terrorist organisation was responsible —
                not to waffle or be ambiguous but to condemn clearly those
                terrorist outrages and make her position absolutely clear?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is also time for the Minister, instead of
                coming here and paying tribute to the Fire Service, which is
                incumbent on all of us, to take the opportunity to pay tribute
                to the other emergency services, notably the police and the
                Army, instead of condoning the murder and maiming of their
                officers and soldiers.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While I have said that it has not been
                possible to disaggregate figures, I am in no way taking away
                from the fact that at the very beginning of my statement I made
                it very clear that I wish to advise Members of the arrangements
                which are being made to pay tribute to the exceptional service
                of the Fire Service over the last 30&nbsp;years. The context in
                which I made that statement is therefore very clear, as was the
                context in which those firefighters carried out their work over
                the last 30&nbsp;years. I have, however, no intention of being
                diverted from what today is about. The suffering which all
                sections of the community have endured over the past
                30&nbsp;years, as a result of the conflict, is a matter for
                regret. Firefighters suffered too, and I regret that and I

                to £51·4&nbsp;million in 2000/01. An additional
                £4·9&nbsp;million was allocated last year, an increase of
                8·5% in real terms. On this year’s resources,
                £51·4&nbsp;million represents an increase of

                persons died over the years of murder and mayhem. It would be
                easy for any Minister to find out exactly who those persons were
                and exactly how they died at the hands of terrorism.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That this Assembly notes the publication by
                the Equality Commission of their tenth annual monitoring report,
                criticises the worsening under-representation of the Protestant
                community, particularly in the public sector, and calls upon the
                Equality Commission to address this problem as a matter of
                urgency.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is more than 22 years since the first
                publication by what was then the Fair Employment Agency on the
                subject of fair employment. Many other publications and reports
                have followed. There have been many references in all of those
                publications to the fact that Roman Catholic males are twice as
                likely to be unemployed as Protestant males. This simplistic
                cliché has underpinned almost all Government legislation since
                1978. There has never been any attempt to accept that, at the
                outset of Northern Ireland’s troubled existence, the leaders
                of Roman Catholic opinion in Northern Ireland called for
                Catholics not to take positions in the Civil Service, the
                largest single employer in the country. It was gross hypocrisy
                then, almost fifty years later, for that same community to
                complain about not getting the jobs it had previously advocated
                not taking up.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since the violence erupted in 1969 there has
                been a huge increase in security-related employment, and because
                of IRA intimidation there has been a low uptake from Roman
                Catholics in that sector. Unfortunately, very little reference
                is made in successive fair employment reports to these
                uncomfortable but factual positions. At the outset others and I
                were very critical of those early reports in that they excluded
                any reference to the discrimination against Protestants.
                Initially, those of us who campaigned on that issue were
                dismissed as being inaccurate or as being only partially
                correct.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After the evidence began to mount, the
                defence from the Fair Employment Agency, later the Fair
                Employment Commission, against these allegations was that
                unfairness against the Protestant community was contained to
                very small geographic areas. Today I intend to demonstrate that
                there is widespread disadvantage being suffered now by the
                Protestant community right across Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to turn now to present day events.
                Quite often in the Equality Commission reports we get facts and
                figures which can mislead people. The most relevant section of
                the tenth monitoring report is chapter five, entitled
                &quot;Applicants and Appointees&quot;. I have made the point
                over and over again to successive Government Departments that
                the composition of a company or a public sector body, many of
                whose employees were employed twenty, thirty or forty years ago,
                is not important. That is of little relevance. What is of
                relevance is what those companies and the public sector are
                doing now, not whom they employed in 1960, 1970 or 1980, but
                whom they are employing today. That is the relevant and most
                significant section of any report.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion refers to the public sector. In
                table 41 from chapter five of the report we can see exactly how
                many people applied for positions in the public sector. This is
                not a small position in some corner; this is not some minor
                firm; this is the public sector, which had 125,448 applicants,
                one in four of the entire employed population of Northern
                Ireland. We are not talking about a sector or a small geographic
                area. We are talking about a swath of people looking for
                employment — more than 125,000 of them. If we exclude, as the
                Equality Commission has done, the applicants who cannot easily
                be put into either Protestant or Roman Catholic categories, we
                are left with 55% who are Protestants and almost 45% who are
                Catholic, and that in itself shows a very slight
                under-representation of Protestants. It is known that of the
                available workforce in Northern Ireland approximately 57% are
                Protestant, so we have a slight under-representation of
                Protestants applying for positions in the public sector.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This cause for concern is minimal, however,
                compared to the concern we have about those who were appointed
                from the 125,000 plus applicants — 16,101 people in all, a
                figure which breaks down to show 52% Protestants and almost 48%
                Catholics. I want to be absolutely clear, so that people know
                exactly what we are talking about, that this covers all sectors
                across Northern Ireland and shows not only an
                under-representation of Protestants applying for positions in
                the public sector, but a further under-representation of
                Protestants actually getting jobs in it. Only 52% were
                successful while Protestants make up 57% of the working
                population in Northern Ireland. As I say, more than 16,000 were
                recruited, and only 52% of them were Protestant.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to look at a couple of sectors to
                emphasise the point. In the health sector, 36,000 people applied
                for employment last year, of whom 49% were Protestant. Remember,
                it ought to have been 57%. Now, if we had expected 57% of those
                recruited to be Protestant, we would have been disappointed.
                Only 48% were Protestant — an under-representation of
                Protestants being employed in the health sector. Now lest anyone
                think that we are talking about a small number of people, over
                6,000 people were offered employment last year in the health
                sector, and only 49% of them were Protestant.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We now turn to the huge education sector
                within the huge public sector where 16,564 people applied for
                jobs. Only 53·8% of them were Protestant — a 4%
                under-representation of the Protestant community in people
                applying for, not getting, jobs. What happened after that? Only
                48% of them were successful. The pattern is emerging in
                department after department, and this time we are talking about
                3,666 people who were successful in getting employment in the
                education sector — another very sizeable number of people.</p>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will move on to the issue of how this
                under-representation is defended. Often when I and others quote
                these statistics, which as I often say are not our statistics,
                but Government statistics from the agency set up to monitor the
                public sector, a defence is made which I call the quality
                defence. That means that there is a fall-back position. Some
                Government officials and some people in the old Fair Employment
                Commission would have said &quot;Yes, the number of Protestants
                being employed is quite small, as you, Mr&nbsp;Campbell, and
                others, allege, but the quality of the jobs, the people at the
                top end of the public sector are very predominantly
                Protestant.&quot; In other words, it is this nonsense that I
                hear from some commentators that Catholics get the menial jobs
                and the Protestants get the cream. That is a total and utter
                fallacy. The fallacy is proven by table 43 in chapter&nbsp;5 of
                the monitoring report.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What does it tell us? It uses a breakdown
                called the Standard Occupational Classification, which runs from
                SOC1 to SOC9. SOC1 jobs are the most highly paid positions:
                managers and administrators. SOC2 covers the professional
                occupations. SOC3s are associate professional and technical
                occupations. And so it goes, down to the lower grades at SOC9.
                If the myth and the nonsense were accurate, one would expect to
                see the highest numbers of Protestants at the higher grades, if
                what I hear from the pan-Nationalist front was accurate. In
                reality, it is the reverse. If we look at SOC1, SOC2 and SOC3,
                the three highest grades in the public sector, they have the
                lowest Protestant success rates. The higher the grade in the
                public sector, the less likely you are to find a Protestant.
                That is what this report tells us.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Looking at SOC1, 48% of those appointed last
                year were Protestant, and almost 52% Catholic. At the second
                highest grade, 47% were Protestant and 53% Catholic. At the
                third highest grade, 48% to just over 51%. You have to go right
                down to the bottom grades to get a higher number of Protestants,
                yet there are those who would tell us that Protestants get the
                most jobs and the best jobs. In reality, Protestants do not get
                their fair share of jobs, and the jobs that they do get are less
                qualified and lower paid. That may be uncomfortable, and people
                may rail against it and complain about it and not like it, but
                it is reality. They will have to face up to it. Where does that
                bring us?</p>

                decreases, the figure for non-returned or non-determined
                background increases in direct proportion?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the hon Member for that inaccurate
                intervention. The Equality Commission has actually said that,
                over the years, the non-determined are decreasing in number, not
                increasing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to come to my conclusion. There have
                been many figures, and I appreciate that those who have not got
                an intense interest might be somewhat confused, but I have tried
                to cut through the confusion and use these statistics to show
                that the myth and the campaign of nonsense is just that. It is
                utter nonsense.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In conclusion, this report proves three
                things. First, it proves that Protestants are slightly
                under-represented in the number of applicants to the public
                service. This cannot be refuted. Secondly, Protestants are even
                more under-represented in the numbers appointed to the positions
                for which they have applied. Again, this is irrefutable. To say
                otherwise is to deny the statistics contained in the report.
                Thirdly, Protestants are losing out in the higher grade of
                classification in the public sector, and, again, this cannot be
                refuted.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That brings us to what we have come to know
                as the equality agenda. Many people, both in this House and
                outside it, have campaigned on an equality agenda and have
                emphasised the need for equality. This infers that there is
                inequality at the moment. These statistics show that there is
                inequality but that it is suffered by the Unionist community.
                The Protestants are the people who are under-represented in the
                public sector and this needs to be addressed immediately by the
                Equality Commission. It must devote sufficient resources to an
                investigation of this problem as a matter of the utmost urgency.</p>

                practising rigid equality by reducing everyone equally.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I too welcome the Equality Commission’s
                tenth annual monitoring report. I will make some important
                statements of principle at the outset. My party stands full
                square on the principle of equality of opportunity — accepting
                the principle of the best man or woman for the job. The 1998
                Northern Ireland Act, in the relevant sections, discussed
                equality of opportunity. Equality of opportunity need not mean
                — and this is a crucial distinction — equality of outcome.
                This has been the subject of much ideological and political
                debate in many countries throughout the last century. This was a
                debate between liberal democracy, where value is ultimately
                placed on equality of opportunity and freedom, and totalitarian
                systems of politics, where attempts were made in vain to have
                everyone on the same level.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Public policy designed to create equality of
                opportunity should be directed towards individuals rather than
                geographical regions. It is individuals who are poor, unemployed
                or disadvantaged, not patches of ground. The key thing in the
                labour market , which is the specific point of this motion, is
                recruitment on merit. It is worth noting that even if
                recruitment is on merit — where the best person gets the job
                in every case — this could still be compatible with an
                unemployment rate differential between the two main sections of
                our community, or indeed with perceived imbalances in the
                percentage composition of employment in given enterprises.
                Chapter 5 of the report, which the proposer of the motion
                emphasised, shows the figures for recruitment inflow into jobs.
                We can see that in 1999 48% of all public sector appointments
                went to Catholics and 46% of private sector appointments
                likewise.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In both cases this represented more than the
                relevant share of the available labour force. This does not, of
                itself, prove discrimination or unfairness, but it is at least a
                cause for concern. It may be argued from some of the Benches
                that, in some sense, positive discrimination is justifiable to
                rectify a perceived historical wrong. However, there are at
                least three main responses to such an argument.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first is a historical reply. How much
                actual and systematic discrimination against Catholics was there
                under the old Stormont Administration? There has been a huge
                debate on that issue among historians, economists, sociologists
                and others, and the result is by no means clear. Secondly, there
                is a moral reply. One should not try to put right one wrong by
                making another one today. Thirdly and lastly, there is a legal
                response. Positive discrimination is plainly illegal under
                current fair employment law. Where it is happening, that is
                wrong, and it is a legitimate cause for concern on the part of
                the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given the specific evidence in chapter&nbsp;5
                of the report, which was highlighted by the proposer of the
                motion, and given the evidence on recruitment flows, I support
                this motion. Thank you.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Lewsley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I oppose this motion, and in doing so I will
                attempt to dispel the myths surrounding equality in employment
                in Northern Ireland — myths, sadly, that Mr&nbsp;Campbell
                seems intent on repeating today. In his motion, Mr&nbsp;Campbell
                spuriously attempts to imply that Catholics have somehow
                received special treatment in Northern Ireland at the expense of
                Protestants. That is not only untrue, it is demonstrably untrue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A myth linked to equality in employment is
                the claim that all new jobs go to Catholics. While the net
                increase in jobs is similar to the increase in the number of
                Catholics in the workforce, this in no way means that all new
                jobs have actually gone to Catholics. There is absolutely no
                evidence of discrimination in the jobs’ market. This can be
                illustrated by looking at the applicant to appointee rates. In
                1999, 44·7% of public sector applicants were Catholic, and
                44·4% of these were appointed; in the private sector Catholic
                applicants were 46·5%, with 46·2% appointees. It is
                interesting to note that the job applicants tend to be young,
                and the proportion of Catholics among the young is higher than
                among the workforce as a whole. Also, there are more Catholics
                who are unemployed and, therefore, applying for jobs and, as
                should be expected, getting jobs. The main problem is the
                under-representation in the Senior Civil Service where, of 232
                staff, only 50 are Catholics.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Even if the Civil Service’s own targets are
                realised, which is unlikely, the figure would only rise to 30%
                by 2006. The SDLP favours setting up a review in this area to
                see how progress can be speeded up. There is also acute
                under-representation of Catholics in security-related
                occupations. The Catholic population is 42% of the workforce.
                When Senior Civil Service posts and security occupations are
                excluded, that percentage rises to 44% — slightly higher —
                but most of those jobs are lower paid ones held by women. There
                is a higher proportion of women in the workforce, 42%. It is to
                be expected that if Catholics will not apply for
                security-related jobs, then they will apply for the lower paid
                jobs. The SDLP has, therefore, called for the new police service
                to be subject to quotas on recruitment, and for it to be
                possible to keep the quota in place for more than 10&nbsp;years.
                The Government has agreed to this.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have called for a guarantee that the quota
                will be kept in place for 10&nbsp;years, and that it will apply
                to police support staff. As the Police Bill stands, it will only
                apply where there are 10&nbsp;similar posts available at the
                same time. This will never happen. The SDLP agrees with the
                Equality Commission that it should apply where there are two
                similar posts.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The main function of fair employment
                legislation is to eliminate discrimination in the employment and
                dismissal of employees. Not one single element of fair
                employment law can be held up by Mr Campbell to demonstrate that
                such laws discriminate against Protestants. Put simply, fair
                employment laws are religion neutral. They favour neither
                Catholic, Protestant, Sikh nor Muslim, so reform of the fair
                employment laws is quite unnecessary.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If, as Mr Campbell claims, there is an
                under-representation of Protestants, perfectly adequate measures
                already exist to address that, the same measures that would be
                applied if there were an under-representation of Catholics or of
                any other religion in Northern Ireland. Fair employment
                legislation does allow for some affirmative action to be taken
                in order to achieve a balanced workforce: encouraging applicants
                from under-represented communities; revising redundancy
                policies; providing training for the long-term unemployed; and
                so on. However, none of those measures discriminates. The
                principle of employing the best person to do the job still holds
                true.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Campbell has previously cited
                over-representation of Catholics on Newry and Mourne District
                Council and Down District Council. These councils have taken
                affirmative action measures to redress this imbalance. I note
                that he failed to mention those councils which are not dealing
                with this issue, for example, Castlereagh Borough Council.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Equality Commission was established as
                part of the Good Friday Agreement, and it espoused equality for
                all. I propose that we do not support this motion.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker. We
                heard very clearly on this side of the House what appeared to be
                a threat from the hon Member, Conor Murphy. He asked someone on
                this side of the House if he was going to make him sit down. In
                everyday parlance outside the House that sort of language is
                normally associated with aggressive, corner-boy tactics and a
                punch-up.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Madam Deputy Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not aware that such a remark was made. I

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">DUP Members would recognise corner-boy
                tactics since it is chiefly they who use them in the Chamber.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Anyway, with regard to the motion from the
                &quot;flat-earth society&quot;, Mr Campbell’s argument about
                applicants and appointees asks us to ignore all the
                discrimination of the past 80 years and just deal with today —
                forget about everything that has gone before, just deal with
                today. It also ignores the fact that the age group most likely
                to be applying for jobs at the moment is different from that of
                what he refers to as the overall population. I think that he is
                referring to the 1991 census. He also asks us to ignore the
                recent statistics which show that Catholics in that age group
                are better qualified. Finally, he asks us to ignore the Equality
                Commission’s report and its interpretation of that report and
                deal with the Gregory Campbell interpretation instead. The
                Equality Commission has said that one of its key challenges is
                the continuing under-representation of Catholics at senior
                grades in the Civil Service. Mr Campbell obviously knows the
                report better than the commission does.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Overall, Protestant male employment has gone
                down by 0·7%, and Protestant female employment has stayed the
                same. The only statistics that I could see that reflected any of
                that was in the section on standard occupational classification
                six, which deals with personal and protective services and
                employment in the security industry. Indeed, Catholics only make
                up 27·4% of the employees in this area. A possible reason for
                the marginal downturn of Protestant employment in this sector
                may be that a large number of RUC officers are availing
                themselves of early retirement, in comparison with the number
                being recruited.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">[Mr Deputy Speaker (Mr McClelland) in the
                Chair]</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The argument has been made that the
                representation of Catholics in the workforce in the public
                sector now reflects their proportion of the economically active
                population. There are a number of points to be made: this
                excludes the security-related occupations; it ignores the fact
                that Catholics are employed in the lower levels of the public
                sector; it ignores the large numbers who are economically
                inactive; and it ignores the fact that a younger Catholic
                workforce is coming on stream, while the Protestant workforce
                reflects an ageing population.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report does not examine where the minute
                increases in Catholic employment or the minute decreases in
                Protestant employment are the result of natural wastage in the
                workforce, for example, where more Protestants are retiring than
                Catholics. The report needs a broader analysis of occupational
                classification such as tenure or duration of employment to get a
                real picture of the employment differential. The 1997 labour
                force survey states that the unemployment rate for Catholics is
                12% as opposed to 5% for Protestants. In my constituency of
                Newry and Armagh it is 15% for Catholics as opposed to 2·9% for
                Protestants. The agency describes the unemployment rate for
                Catholics as being substantially higher than for Protestants,
                but says that the Government are committed to narrowing the gap.
                It is worrying that some of the recent attempts to undermine the
                unemployment differential as a measure of disadvantage and
                discrimination have come from the Office of the First and the
                Deputy First Minister. We will continue to be very vigilant
                about this.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that the Equality Commission ignored
                the attacks on the unemployment differential as a measure of
                disadvantage and discrimination —</p>

                Commission shows that over a period of 10 years very significant
                progress was made on the historic imbalance in the employment
                for Catholics.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is something to be welcomed rather than
                criticised or belittled. It is progress that has been made in
                our society, and it is important for us to reflect on the fact
                that progress has been made since the introduction of the Fair
                Employment (Northern Ireland) Act 1989. The preceding Fair
                Employment (Northern Ireland) Act 1976 had very little power,
                and between that period and 1990 the situation for Catholics at
                work did not improve very much.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This shows the effect of the determination of
                the Fair Employment Agency and the Fair Employment Commission to
                tackle the problem of employment for Catholics since that time,
                and that is something to be celebrated rather than criticised.
                In some areas there are still significant deficiencies. If one
                looks, for example, at the heavy engineering industry in
                Belfast, one can see considerable under-representation of
                Catholics. The same is true in the security forces and in the
                higher levels of the Civil Service. This motion is trying to
                cherry-pick one aspect to show that the Protestant community is
                suffering from some form of reverse discrimination. That is
                absolute nonsense, and when one looks at the figures, and at the
                totality of this report, one can see quite clearly that that is
                not happening.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let me take issue with Mr&nbsp;Campbell, who
                talked about &quot;the simple cliché of Catholic
                unemployment&quot;. How insulting can one get? Anybody who is
                unemployed suffers. Nobody is unemployed because he wants to be,
                and anyone who is unemployed is suffering serious disadvantage.
                To belittle people and to belittle that section of the community
                and refer to them as a simple cliché is outrageous. For any
                responsible Member of this House to use that sort of language to
                insult people is something to be deplored by all Members of this
                House. I hope that Mr&nbsp;Campbell will withdraw that remark,
                because it is a searing insult to people and seriously damaging.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When one looks at the overall situation in
                Northern Ireland and at the continuing problem of the
                over-representation of Catholics within the unemployed sector,
                one has to address that and ask why we have this historic
                problem. I believe that new TSN is one way of addressing it.
                There is no point in our coming to the House and bemoaning the
                problem — we have to have policies that will direct the
                attention of the Administration and public services to
                eradicating it. That is something with which we can all agree,
                because there would be a net benefit for the whole community. I
                look forward to the day when there is full employment in this
                community and when this unseemly scrabble over statistics on
                imbalances in the workplace is finally put to rest.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome both the report and the debate.
                Even though we tend to disagree, it is healthy that we discuss
                these important matters. In an earlier debate I stated that
                equality means different things to different people. I can now
                say the same thing about the statistics in the Equality
                Commission’s report. Statistics can be interpreted in many
                ways depending on the reader and what they wish to extract from
                them. Indeed, as I am sure everyone knows, Mark Twain referred
                to them as</p>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report was actually quite heartening,
                particularly from the point of view that jobs in all sectors
                appear to be more accessible to all job seekers in Northern
                Ireland. Concerns on the issues of gender and religious
                persuasion have been, and are continuing to be, addressed. One
                of my principal concerns on the issue of monitoring is that it
                does not seem to take into account that it is still very
                difficult, if not impossible, to employ people in areas of
                Northern Ireland where they do not feel comfortable. Some
                people, because of gender, religion, race or ability, do not
                feel comfortable and perhaps do not feel safe, not just in the
                workplace itself, but also in travelling to and from their place
                of work.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we examine the tables in chapters three,
                four and five of the report, which outline the composition of
                authorities, public and private sector bodies and appointments
                to them, they confirm the fact that in some areas the situation
                somehow determines the make-up of the workforce. We must try to
                read such a report objectively.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have also been particularly heartened by
                the increase in female employment, not only in the traditional
                service areas, but also in public sector management. I have
                examined the tables and figures given in the report,
                particularly those relating to the public sector, which appear
                to cause Mr&nbsp;Campbell concern. I do not see any substantial
                evidence to suggest that his views are completely right. The
                report states that an increase in the participation of Catholics
                in the workforce was approximately half of one percent each year
                over the ten years of the monitoring. I do not think that that
                is too worrying.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Protestants continue to be fairly represented
                in Northern Ireland’s workforce and still find themselves in
                the majority in many sectors. The statistics, of course, do not
                show an increase in the percentage representation of Catholics
                in various sectors. However, after years of gross
                under-representation of Catholic people in our workforce, at
                least progress has been made towards achieving a just and
                balanced situation. Therefore, these figures should be warmly
                welcomed instead of being used to set off alarm bells. However,
                I say to Mr Campbell, if alarm bells are set off, the Equality
                Commission should be asked to account for that. Mr Campbell is
                actually implying that there is — positive though it may be
                — religious discrimination against Protestants. As another
                Member stated, this is illegal and it should be dealt with. I
                hope that Mr Campbell will be taking that matter to the
                Commission.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All in all, I am glad to see that in both the
                public and private sectors there is redress in the balance of
                Catholic workers. It is noted that there is still concern with
                respect to the percentage representation of Catholics in the
                security sector, but let us hope that this too will be reduced
                and not necessarily through quotas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There should never be tokenism of a religious
                or a gender nature, and I think the report shows that that is
                not the case. The Civil Service, as has been mentioned, also
                needs to look at the gender and religious background of its
                senior grades. I hope, as a member of the Commission, that all
                our recruitment procedures will be open, transparent and
                accessible and fair to all.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Beneficial as these statistics may be in
                monitoring Northern Ireland’s workforce, I long to see the day
                that the focus will be taken away from whether an employee is
                Catholic or Protestant; male or female; able or disabled, or is
                of any particular race. Instead, I hope that jobs are awarded to
                candidates on merit alone. I hope that one day a person will be
                capable of proving him or herself the best candidate for a job
                just for being the person they are, and not for what the
                statistics say they should be. I cannot support the motion.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion. When the Government are
                faced with the issue of equality they can take one of two
                routes. Either they can support equality of opportunity for all,
                which is the correct route, or they can try to eliminate the
                unemployment differential between the two main communities. That
                is clearly the route which the SDLP is going down in supporting
                quotas in the RUC. Unfortunately, that has been the net effect
                of the fair employment legislation over the last 25&nbsp;years.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unfortunately, I have only five&nbsp;minutes,
                so I shall not give way.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If one compares employment statistics from
                1971 onwards, one will find that the Catholic share of the
                workforce in 1971 was about 29%. It is now nearly 40%. The
                number of Protestants in employment now compared with 1971 is
                down by roughly 15,000. The number of Catholics in employment
                has risen by about 84,000. Yet in spite of this large increase,
                in both actual and percentage terms, a differential gap remains
                with regard to the number of Catholics employed. As has been
                claimed by some other Members, such a gap does not mean that
                there is employment inequality, for while the Catholic
                percentage share of employment has increased throughout that
                period, it has constantly been chasing a moving target,
                particularly because of birth-rate differentials and other
                factors.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also question whether the figure of 39·6%
                for the Catholic share of the workforce is correct, since it is
                based on public-sector employees and those in private-sector
                firms employing more than 25&nbsp;people. Indeed, if one
                compares the 1991 figure with the census figure, one will find
                that about 170,000&nbsp;people are not included. These,
                generally speaking, are people employed in small firms. Figures
                suggest that they have a higher Catholic recruitment rate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I should like to move to the substance of the
                motion. The statistics tell us a number of things. First, in
                public-sector recruitment figures for nine of the last
                10&nbsp;years, the percentage of Catholics appointed was higher
                than their share of the workforce, and in the one year when it
                was not, it was more or less the same. In the private sector,
                this was true for each of the last 10 years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us break that down using another
                statistic. I have carried out a little research on this. There
                were 37&nbsp;public bodies in 1997 with a higher percentage of
                Catholic employees than their share of the workforce,
                41&nbsp;with a higher percentage of Protestants than one might
                expect. Using these statistics, how have they performed since
                1997? Of the 37 public-sector bodies with a disproportionately
                high number of Roman Catholics, in 24 cases the percentage of
                Catholic employment has actually risen. In only 10 of them has
                it gone down.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of the 41 public bodies with a
                disproportionately high number of Protestants, the percentage of
                Catholics in 1999 rose in 29 and decreased in nine. There were
                23 bodies with a disproportionately high number of Roman
                Catholics in 1991. Of those, 17 had actually increased their
                percentage of Roman Catholics by 1999. Of the five where that
                percentage decreased, in only one case was it by more than 2%.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The same can be seen on the Protestant side,
                where 32 public bodies had a disproportionately high number of
                Protestants. The Catholic percentage has increased in 27 of them
                and decreased in only three. We are seeing a two-tier reaction
                on fair employment. Where there is a disproportionately high
                number of Catholics in the public sector, that number is
                increasing. Where there is a disproportionately high number of
                Protestants, it is decreasing. Those statistics clearly show
                that there is discrimination.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the broad sectors of health
                and education, where there has been a disproportionately high
                number of Catholics, that percentage has increased. In the other
                sectors where there is a disproportionately high number of
                Protestants, it has decreased. This clearly shows
                discrimination.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I urge Members to support the motion.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dallat:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many years ago, when the SDLP campaigned for
                funding for the Fair Employment Agency it was very much opposed
                by the DUP. I am delighted to see so many copies of the equal
                opportunities report tonight — that is progress.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I once read a paperback called ‘How to Lie
                with Statistics’. It is an absolute must for the politician
                who wants to make a case out of nothing. I threw it away because
                I want to live in the real world — not the world of
                make-believe.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For years I followed with interest Mr
                Campbell’s claims of discrimination in his native city, and I
                often wondered if he was really genuine in his quest for fair
                employment. My wishes were granted when he got the DUP
                nomination for East Derry — mind you, the local papers are
                still talking about the statistics for that. He won the seat,
                and I was glad. This was because I hoped he would bring with him
                the strong anti-discriminatory principles he has been telling us
                about all these years. But not a bit of it. Indeed, I suggest he
                would defend to the death the high moral ground of those
                employers in his new constituency who have serious problems
                redressing the imbalance in their workforces but stubbornly
                refuse to carry in their advertisements the ice-breaker &quot;We
                are equal opportunities employers&quot;.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is the problem with statistics. You can
                add them, multiply them, or do what you like with them. You can
                say the tank is half empty or half full, depending on whether
                you are a pessimist or an optimist. Unfortunately, Catholic male
                unemployment is still twice as high as that for Protestants.
                Over the last ten years the figures in the public service have
                not changed significantly. There is a slight fall in Protestant
                representation, matched by a slight increase in Catholic
                percentages — that is all. In local government, taking an
                average of all 26 councils, 63.4% of all employees are still
                designated as Protestant. In several categories Catholics are
                particularly under-represented, especially in the higher grades.
                In the four worst councils, the average percentage of Catholic
                employment is less than 8%.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nevertheless, there has been improvement, and
                all right-thinking people should be encouraged by that progress
                because in the end every one is a winner. When genuine equality
                has been established, the old system of begging for a job on the
                basis of religion, rather than ability and skills to do the job,
                will be gone, and this country will have come of age. Fair
                employment legislation is no longer peculiar to Northern
                Ireland. We may have pioneered it out of necessity, but it is
                now common practice for countries all over the world to monitor
                performance figures, not only on grounds of religion but on
                gender, age, disability and all the other categories listed in
                the Equality Commission’s report. That is nothing more than
                common sense and good practice. The figures Mr Campbell quotes
                are cleverly selected to make a case were there is none, but I
                am not suggesting that he has been reading my book &quot;How to
                Lie with Statistics&quot;. However, he could well have written
                it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fair employment is still an emotive term. It
                whips up fears and encourages prejudices. Fair employment
                legislation is just as important for the Protestant community as
                it is for the Catholic community. All persons are entitled to
                have their rights protected. Let us work the legislation by
                keeping our attention focused on real politics. Let us work
                together in harmony so that new high paid, skilled jobs are
                created and no one is unemployed or made to hold down jobs which
                require lower skills than they have. That is the work faced by
                politicians in the future, and that is what we should be about,
                rather than living in the past, which failed everyone and
                benefited no one. No one in their right mind condones
                discrimination against Protestants; there is nothing to be had
                in reversing the roles.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unfortunately, the motion is divisive and
                that is regrettable because it denies the Assembly the
                opportunity to speak with one voice on a subject that is common
                to everyone. The SDLP in no way condones discrimination against
                any group of people and we are seriously concerned that Mr
                Campbell will be successful in creating a chill factor among
                Protestants. That is precisely what happened in Down Council
                where a DUP member made claims of discrimination where there
                were none and created a problem as a result of his claims. I am
                totally against the motion, and I am sorry it was discussed here
                at all.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat. I have listened with
                interest to the contributions made here on the issue of equality
                of employment, and I have to say that if this issue were not so
                serious, comments made by those on the Unionist benches would be
                laughable. For eighty years, since the inception of this state,
                discrimination has been carried out wholesale on the Nationalist
                community. For years, your name and the school you attended were
                more of an indication of your ability to do a job than your
                qualifications. When hundreds of young Catholics boarded boats
                and planes in search of employment, the shipyard in Belfast was
                employing men on the basis that their father, brother or uncle
                had worked there before them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now, after years of work in the community,
                intense lobbying by Nationalist representatives and the Irish
                Government, and international pressure, due in no small part to
                the MacBride principles, we have finally got legislation in
                place to try to address this. However, there is no getting away
                from the fact that Catholics are still more likely to be
                unemployed than Protestants in the Six Counties.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are now hearing about studies being
                carried by Unionist advisors who are attempting to redefine the
                criteria for ranking deprivation. Attempts are being made to
                devise a formula to find the pockets of deprivation complained
                of by the UUP and DUP. The consequence of this will be that
                pockets of deprivation will be given ranking equivalence to ward
                upon ward of deprived Nationalist and Republican communities.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No, I do not have enough time. Everyone knows
                that the argument that the UUP and DUP have made over pockets of
                deprivation amidst affluence having some sort of equivalence to
                wards of multiple deprivation has no theoretical basis in social
                science. However, it is likely to be presented in such a way as
                to suggest it does. This attempt to equalise or neutralise
                deprivation fails when one examines statistical evidence in
                constituencies like Fermanagh and South Tyrone, where Catholic
                unemployment stands at 13.3% compared to 3.9% Protestant
                unemployment. Republicans have concerns that the Office of the
                First Minister and Deputy First Minister is not seriously
                addressing equality matters. Indeed, it is not just Republicans
                but many Nationalists who regard high ranking civil servants and
                advisors as people who wield too much influence over the future
                of the equality agenda, especially when one of those advisors
                has already stated his ‘religious blind’ approach when
                dealing with equality matters. This approach is in direct
                conflict with affirmative action programmes, action plans and
                timetables.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Examining latest labour force survey reports,
                which are the most recent available statistic denoting long-term
                unemployment, one finds that the survey for 1997 revealed an
                alarming differential of 2.9% for Catholic males when compared
                to Protestant males. Such a figure was the highest differential
                since the 1960’s. Furthermore, page 9 of the most recently
                published labour force survey report states quite clearly that
                Catholic males have been typically twice as likely as Protestant
                males to be unemployed. Yet, we hear Mr Campbell refer to the
                worsening under-representation of the Protestant community,
                particularly relating to the public sector.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since this statelet was artificially created,
                its over-representation by the Protestant community has been
                well documented. The statelet has been policed by one section of
                the community, and has also been serviced by that same
                Protestant community in the Civil Service. Therefore, one of the
                many problems that the Equality Commission needs to address,
                urgently, is the religious and gender composition of the Civil
                Service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Attention must be given to the fact that
                there is still an under-representation of Catholics throughout
                the service, especially at the higher levels. There is a need
                for an urgent review of its compositional make-up. While noting
                how few Catholics are employed, consideration also needs to be
                given to how few women are employed, and how few of them hold
                managerial and professional positions in the standard
                occupational classification ranking.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If such data were examined, Mr Campbell would
                learn that it is the under-representation of the Catholic
                community and the over-representation of the Protestant
                community that must be dealt with. Sinn Féin asks the Equality
                Commission to address this matter urgently.</p>

                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Nesbitt:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have listened carefully to Members on both
                sides of the House, and I would like to begin by making some
                general comments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First of all, equality is at the heart of the
                Good Friday Agreement. It must be applied to both communities
                and in an even-handed way. By recruiting only on merit, we are
                doing just that. The right man or woman should secure the job
                solely on that basis.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Equality Commission’s report, its
                tenth, makes a valuable contribution to the understanding of
                what is a very sensitive issue for both the Catholic and
                Protestant communities. Is there or is there not discrimination?
                Is there or is there not fair employment? Is there or is there
                not fair promotion? Is there or is there not fair recruitment?
                These are very sensitive issues to both communities. Therefore,
                as I said on 6 June when I last spoke on the subject, I will
                measure my words carefully. I will endeavour, Mr Deputy Speaker,
                to stand over every word I say.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As always with statistics, they need to be
                read and interpreted very carefully and not quoted ambiguously.
                There are structural changes we must be aware of — for
                example, the age structure of the population. There is a higher
                proportion of the younger age group in the Catholic community.
                Also, immigration, emigration and birth rates are different with
                respect to the Catholic and Protestant communities. These
                factors must be considered in the analysis of the statistics.
                The key test is, as noted, applicants and appointees, and how
                they move into employment. They may come from the unemployed or
                from the inactive population. They may be students or mothers
                who were not working and now seek work. Those entering
                employment come from different sources. Therefore, it is never
                easy to draw conclusions about the differential aspects of
                unemployment and about whether there is fairness in employment.
                Everything must be carefully analysed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I mentioned the unemployment differential. I
                am conscious that Mr Campbell refers to the under-representation
                of Protestants, the corollary of that being the vast increase in
                work for Catholics that is seen to be happening in Northern
                Ireland. I want to make it clear: there are more Catholics
                unemployed. If more Catholics are unemployed there is more
                disadvantage. If there are more Catholics unemployed and they
                are all seeking work and are all equally qualified, and if we
                are working on the merit principle then it follows that, on a
                proportionate basis, more Catholics would be getting jobs than
                Protestants. That is not detrimental to the merit principle or
                to equality of opportunity, and it is not unfair. Therefore, we
                must be very careful in our analysis of the statistics. I will
                not say any more about the unemployment differential, and I have
                to tell Mr&nbsp;Conor&nbsp;Murphy that I will stand over the
                comments I have made on the subject.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let me now deal with the point in the motion
                about the worsening under-representation of the Protestant
                community. As I said, statistics are to be interpreted
                carefully. Therefore, I cannot support Mr Campbell’s motion.
                In my view, the jury is out on it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let me just give one or two statistics. The
                Protestant workforce is 60.4%, but 58% of the available
                workforce is from the Protestant community. Therefore, the
                proportion in work is higher than that available for work from
                the Protestant community. The private sector employs 60.2% of
                Protestants, but the public sector employs 61%. Remember,
                Protestants make up 58% of those available for work. I know Mr
                Campbell quotes Government statistics, but there is a difficulty
                with Government statistics. Government statistics from the
                Department of Finance and Personnel state that the number of
                applicants from 1996 to 1998 from the Protestant community was
                46.7% while 51.5% of those appointed were Protestant. These
                statistics are not exactly the same as those in the monitoring
                report from the Fair Employment Commission or the Equal
                Opportunities Commission.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have two sets of statistics that say a
                slightly different thing. Let me just give you one of the
                reasons for the difference. The Equality Commission’s report
                stated that if one person applied ten times for a job, it would
                count as one application. However, the Department of Finance and
                Personnel, if one person applied ten times, would count it as
                ten applications — a totally different basis for the
                statistics, yet both are, to use Mr Campbell’s words,
                &quot;Government statistics&quot;.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yes, there are statistics and selective
                statistics. Mr Campbell referred to health and education. You
                could equally refer to the Equality Commission’s report on
                district councils. According to page 54, 56.8% of the district
                councils were Protestant, as were 58.1% of those who were
                appointed, so there are statistics and statistics. I cannot
                support the precise wording of Mr&nbsp;Campbell’s motion. It
                criticises the worsening under-representation, and the jury is
                still out on that.</p>

                have said, Mr&nbsp;Deputy&nbsp;Speaker.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I could not agree more with the comment of my
                Colleague Mr Dallat that he found it extremely difficult to keep
                patience with this sort of nonsense. Mr Campbell endeavoured to
                give the House some facts. Let me give you some facts that
                derive directly from the statistics. Protestants make up 58% of
                the available workforce. Catholics make up 42%. Overall, the
                Protestant share of the workforce is currently 60·4%. That is
                2·4% higher than their numbers in the available workforce. In
                the private sector, Protestants make up 60·2% of the workforce,
                which is 2·2% higher than their share of the available
                workforce. In the public sector, they make up 61%. In the
                Northern Ireland Civil Service between 1996 and 1998, 46·7% of
                applications were from Protestants, and that resulted in their
                getting 51·5% of the appointments.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Haughey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Catholics made 44·7% of the applications and
                were awarded 42·8% of the appointments. In the higher reaches
                of the Civil Service there are 232 staff, of whom 50 are
                Catholics: 21·5% of the workforce. Only one Northern Ireland
                Civil Service category has an under-representation of the
                Protestant community. That is the 114 careers officers. When
                monitoring began in 1990, Catholics made up 34·9% of the
                workforce. In 1999 they were assessed at 39·6%. That is an
                encouraging increase, but it still falls short of the 42% of the
                available workforce who are Catholic. There is still work to be
                done.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Whereas fair employment legislation is based
                on the merit principle at the point of employment, and redress
                is possible through the courts, affirmative action is also
                possible. We in the SDLP would have liked to see a great deal
                more of that, but as certain people will have learned over the
                last 30 years, you cannot get all that you want. The affirmative
                action that we would have liked to see does not extend to the
                sort of measures that I thought —wrongly, I am afraid — I
                had in front of me.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Moving on, I agree emphatically with my
                Colleague Alban Maginness about TSN. Research indicates that a
                number of factors cause relative deprivation in the Catholic
                community and give rise to greater difficulty in gaining
                employment. The Catholic community has a younger age structure.
                There is reluctance on the part of Catholics to seek employment
                in security-related occupations. There is a higher proportion of
                Catholics in the lower socio-economic groups where unemployment
                is highest. A higher proportion of Catholic than Protestant
                families have large numbers of children. That is a very telling
                point. In both communities, families with large numbers of
                children are more prone to unemployment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That brings me to an important point about
                new TSN. New TSN targets social disadvantage. We hope that that
                will lead to an erosion of the differentials in unemployment
                between the two communities, not because it discriminates in
                favour of the Catholic community but because it targets social
                disadvantage. Targeting social disadvantage helps those, both
                Protestant and Catholic, who happen to be socially
                disadvantaged, and therefore it is a non-discriminatory attack
                on the reasons for the differential in unemployment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have very little time left, but I would
                like to ask Mr&nbsp;Campbell a question. I hope he will answer.
                I do not want him to evade it. There are people in the DUP, and
                further afield, who believe that Protestants are currently being
                unfairly treated in the labour market. There are many people in
                my party, and in other parties, who believe that there is a
                continuing problem with fair employment and that the
                difficulties lie disproportionately on the Catholic side of the
                community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Can we agree on one simple conclusion from
                all of this — that there is a difficulty with fair employment?
                That says to me that we need the toughest and the strongest
                possible legislation to outlaw discrimination in employment.
                Does Mr&nbsp;Campbell agree with me on that? We need the
                toughest and the strongest possible Government agencies to deal
                with the problem of inequality in education and with
                discrimination where it exists. We need to monitor the whole
                situation so that the Government can take appropriate measures.
                Predictably, but regrettably, Sinn Féin Members tried to lay
                blame on the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First
                Minister in relation to these matters. I regret that their
                concern about fair employment did not extend to their Colleagues

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I think that a period of cool, calm
                reflection is required, and I hope I will be able to bring
                something of that to the debate. I will try to deal with some of
                the issues that were raised.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In dealing with the factual position
                underlining and underpinning the motion, I had hoped that those
                who oppose it would have had some substance to their argument. I
                had hoped that they might not revert to hyperbole, to emotive
                phrases and to simplistic catchphrases. I had hoped that would
                be the case, but I am afraid to say that I have been
                disappointed. However, when a community and a series of public
                representatives are faced with cold, hard facts that they may
                want to quibble about, that they may want to dodge, that they
                may want to try to avoid or evade and cannot, then they have to
                resort to clichés. I had hoped that they might actually engage
                in the substance of the debate, but sadly, all too often this
                was not the case. Ms&nbsp;Lewsley made reference to the numbers
                of unemployed, and she is right of course. Proportionately there
                are more unemployed Roman Catholics than Protestants, but there
                is an underlying assumption that the 125,000 people who applied
                for jobs in the public sector all came from the ranks of the
                unemployed. Why should people assume that this is the case? Of
                course it is not the case. A sizeable number of them may be, but
                not all of those applying for jobs in the public sector are
                unemployed. To imply that the unemployment ratio should be used
                as a benchmark against which the numbers of public sector
                applicants are assessed really is a nonsense. I hope I have
                dealt with that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not going to give credibility to those
                who represent terrorism by naming them, but several Nationalist
                Members had the breathtaking hypocrisy to mention that the
                security-related sector has to be taken into account — I
                thought they would have avoided it like the plague. These
                people, who for 30 years have advised Catholics not to take jobs
                in the security-related sector, are now saying that Catholics
                are under-represented in the security-related field.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is what I meant by &quot;breathtaking
                hypocrisy&quot;. They were advised not to take positions in the
                security sector, and the small number from the Roman Catholic
                community who did were intimidated. Members, some of whom are
                associated with the organisation that did the intimidating, are
                now getting to their feet and saying that there are very few
                Catholics in the security sector. There are very few Catholics
                in that sector because their affiliates shot them when they did
                work in it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The SDLP does not escape blame. Since 1972 it
                has advocated that the Catholic community should not take up
                employment with the RUC, the UDR or the Royal Irish Regiment,
                yet many SDLP Members have asked tonight, as a defence, about
                the security-related sector. The position in the
                security-related sector would have been much better if the SDLP
                had advocated that its community should join. They are
                responsible for the under-representation of Catholics in the
                security-related sector, although not as much as the IRA, which
                shot people when they did come forward from the Catholic
                community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Mr&nbsp;Weir for his reference to the
                differential gap. At the outset I referred to the cliché about
                Catholics being more likely to be unemployed than Protestants.
                Certain people seem to have a blind spot, because statistics
                available in the Irish Republic show that Catholics in Counties
                Donegal and Monaghan are three times more likely to be
                unemployed than Protestants. Is that because of discrimination?
                If it is, what are the Dublin Government doing about it? That
                situation cannot be because of a Government agency, a conspiracy
                or a sense of paranoia in the establishment in Dublin to deprive
                the good Catholics of Monaghan and Donegal of employment. The
                reasons for such a situation in the Irish Republic need to be
                addressed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">References were made to the principle of
                equality, and I was amazed at the junior Minister,
                Mr&nbsp;Nesbitt, referring to equality being at the heart of the
                Good Friday Agreement. If equality is at the heart of the
                agreement then we will see within a week the terms of that
                equality. If the Unionist community is demonstrated to be
                opposed to this agreement, and if a greater number of Unionists
                is against this agreement than for it, then there will have to
                be a fundamental reassessment if equality is at the heart of it.
                However, that is a matter for next week, and I will not proceed
                down that avenue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The other junior Minister, Mr&nbsp;Haughey,
                referred to the overall workforce breakdown, and my concluding
                remarks will deal with that.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is somewhat confusing for the average
                layperson hearing these figures being bandied about to come to
                terms with the overall principle underpinning the motion. That
                is why I attempted to keep it as general as possible and why I
                studiously avoided being selective, despite the accusations. If
                we look at tables 41 and 42 on pages&nbsp;47 and 48 of the tenth
                annual monitoring report, we see that 55% of public-sector
                applications are from Protestants, but only 52% of all
                appointees are Protestant. People can avoid, evade or dodge
                that. They can try to get under it, climb over it, or get round
                it, but they will have to face up to it eventually. That is
                equality at work.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Protestant community is demanding true
                equality. As of the tenth annual monitoring report, it does not
                have that. People can try to take us up a sidetrack or bring us
                into bypath meadow, but they cannot evade the central issue —
                the Protestant community’s under-representation in the public

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have just made a point of order; it was not
                a point of information. It was to point out that
                Mr&nbsp;Campbell has five minutes left in which he could answer
                the question. Does all of this mean that we need the strongest
                possible fair employment legislation?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That was not a point of order. I assumed that
                you were asking Mr&nbsp;Campbell to give way.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Campbell:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thought that Mr&nbsp;Haughey was trying to
                intervene. I allowed him to intervene, and then he declined.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the point raised by Mr&nbsp;Haughey,
                a lack of tough legislation is not the issue. The issue is how
                that legislation is being implemented when it comes down to
                Mr&nbsp;Weir’s point about under-representation in either
                section of the community. Is there equal validity being given to
                the under-representation of Catholics in a workforce, as there
                is to the under-representation of Protestants in a workforce.
                The reality is that there is not. There is not the same emphasis
                or resources being deployed to deal with under-representation of
                Protestants, as I made clear at the outset.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Equality Commission, the Government and
                the previous Fair Employment Commission based the whole
                rationale for their fair-employment legislation on the fact that
                Catholics are more likely to be unemployed than Protestants.
                They will not move away from that underlying principle. Until
                they do, we will be in an awkward position.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Haughey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Member mean that we need different
                fair employment legislation? Do we need even tougher fair
                employment legislation? Is that what the Member means? Is he
                proposing that we have different and tougher fair employment
                legislation?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Campbell:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the junior Minister for that point. I
                thought I was making it clear, but let me make it even more
                clear. It is not the lack of legislation; it is how that
                legislation is being implemented. If, despite the effective
                legislation that is on the statute book, the Equality Commission
                can devote its time and resources to dealing with the
                under-representation of Catholics in certain sectors of the
                workforce but will not devote time and resources to dealing with
                the under-representation of Protestants in certain sectors of
                the workforce, the problem is not the legislation; the problem
                rests with those who are implementing it. The equality of the
                implementation of that legislation is what is at the heart of
                this motion.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Weir:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Member agree that a further
                statistic which shows the level of discrimination against the
                Protestant community in terms of employment in recent years is
                that, because of the improving economic situation since 1991,
                Protestant employment has risen by only 11%, whereas Catholic
                employment has risen by 36%?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Campbell:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank my hon Friend for that statistic. It
                certainly makes a point. It illustrates how those who raise the
                old bogey-stories about the breakdown of the workforces from
                years ago — are trying deliberately to miss the point. The
                point we are making in this motion is that we must talk about
                the flow of workforces, the appointees and the applicants. That
                is what tells us what is happening in the workforce now — in
                the year 2000. That is the important issue — not employment
                levels in 1962 or in the 1970s and 1980s. We need to know what
                is happening now. That is what will form the basis for the
                future breakdowns of all our workforces. That is why this motion
                needs support from this House. That is why the Equality
                Commission needs to act to stem the flow and halt the
                under-representation of Protestant applicants and appointees in
                the public sector.</p>
