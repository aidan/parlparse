                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Business Committee has allocated two
                hours for the debate on the motion concerning the display of
                lilies in Parliament Buildings. A valid petition of concern in
                respect of the motion was tabled before the Business Office
                closed yesterday. Having checked the petition, I regard it as
                fulfilling the requirements of Standing Order 27. Any vote on
                the motion will be on a cross-community basis. Members wishing
                to inspect this or any future petition of concern may obtain
                copies from the Business Office.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker.
                May I ask you to list the names on the petition of concern?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Madam Deputy Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have told the Assembly that copies of the
                petition are available in the Business Office.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGrady:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker. I
                presume that the motion was accepted under Standing Order 11(1),
                which indicates that earlier meetings of the Assembly may be
                called for specific matters of urgent public importance.
                Clearly, someone accepted the motion about lilies or flowers in
                the Great Hall of this Building as a matter of urgent public
                importance.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will you confirm, Madam Deputy Speaker, that
                you accepted the motion under the terms of Standing Orders? It
                may be appropriate to explain why the display of flowers in the
                Great Hall is a matter of urgent public importance. Why is the
                matter distinct from the many crises in previous recesses, such
                as the blizzards and storms over Christmas, in respect of which
                no motions were put down?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Madam Deputy Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion falls under Standing Order 11(1),
                which refers to</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;a … matter of urgent public
                importance.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thirty Members signed the motion that called
                for this early meeting. Thus, an adequate percentage of Members
                demonstrated a sense of urgency sufficient for the motion to
                satisfy the requirement of Standing Orders. That is not a matter
                of judgement for the Speaker; the requirement of Standing Order
                11 is for 30 signatures, and that requirement has been met.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGrady:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Further to that point of order, Madam Deputy
                Speaker. There are two requirements under Standing Order 11(1).
                First, the First and Deputy First Ministers can summon a
                meeting, or 30 Members can sign a petition to summon a meeting,
                as you rightly say. The second qualification for a valid motion
                is the purpose of the meeting. That second qualification clearly
                states that a debate can be held</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;for the purpose of discussing a
                specific matter of urgent public importance.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A layman would not think that this is a
                matter of urgent public importance. Therefore the motion is
                invalid.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr J Kelly:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Further to that point of order, Madam Deputy
                Speaker. Is not the criterion for an emergency debate — and
                God knows that there are many emergencies out there waiting to
                be debated — not the 30 signatures but whether there is an
                emergency? The Democratic Unionist Party has tabled this motion
                for purely sectarian, political reasons.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Further to that point of order, Madam Deputy
                Speaker. Will you confirm that the matter is of such urgent
                public concern that the Members opposite have signed a petition
                of concern?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A total of 30 Members signed the motion — a
                significant percentage of the Assembly — and they see the
                matter as one of urgent public importance.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That this Assembly instructs the Assembly
                Commission to rescind its decision to display lilies in
                Parliament Buildings during the Easter Recess and deprecates the
                abuse of the voting system which brought about the original
                decision.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do so in the names of the 30 Members
                (including myself) who signed the requisition for an emergency
                sitting. I thank those from a wide spectrum of Unionist opinion
                who took the time on Friday to come to Parliament Buildings for
                that purpose. Some went out of their way, and that is
                appreciated.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Two important points have been raised about
                the calling of the debate. Some Members say that the holding of
                a special meeting of the Assembly is a waste of time and money.
                I would have preferred the matter to be dealt with by the
                Assembly Commission. For that reason, Rev Robert Coulter and I
                called a special meeting of the Commision at 11.00 am on Friday.
                Although the Speaker, myself and Mr&nbsp;Coulter were available
                for a meeting, the representatives of Sinn Féin, the SDLP and
                Alliance refused to turn up. As a result, there was no quorum

                Commission to rescind its decision. Mrs Bell, Mr Fee and the
                other representatives knew that had that meeting been held,
                Mr&nbsp;Coulter and I, with 52 votes between us, would have been
                able to ensure that the decision was rescinded. So there was

                Standing Order 60 indicates how good order is to be maintained
                in the Chamber. Paragraph (1)(a) states that when a Member
                &quot;wilfully obstructs&quot; a debate in the Chamber it is up
                to the Speaker to take action. It is clear that a number of

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I made it clear that if 11.00 am was
                inconvenient, the meeting could be held at 5.00 pm, 7.00 pm,
                midnight — at any time on Friday, in fact. We are here today
                because those members of the Commission who boycotted that
                meeting would not allow the democratic will of the Assembly to
                be exerted. They could do the arithmetic and they knew that
                Rev&nbsp;Robert&nbsp;Coulter and I between us had the majority
                of the votes of the Assembly, allocated to us for the purposes
                of that vote.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is amazing how many Members have been on
                radio condemning what they consider to be a trivial matter. Mr
                McGrady, Mr Close and Mrs Bell have been tripping over
                themselves to go on radio to comment on something that they
                consider trivial. Methinks they do protest too much.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members have referred to the calling of this
                emergency meeting of the Assembly while there was no such
                emergency meeting after Omagh. After the Omagh bombing the DUP
                and others called for an emergency debate, but we were not
                allowed to have one by the Secretary of State. So let us nail
                that lie.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fundamental decision that we will make
                today is whether this Building, the home of the Northern Ireland
                Assembly, should be used for a floral display dedicated to the
                memory of the terrorists who have tortured this community for 30
                years. Let us be absolutely clear: this is not simply about a
                floral display representing the Irishness felt by some Members
                of the Assembly. If they wanted that Irishness represented, they
                could have used shamrock. Through the Assembly Commission, Sinn
                Féin has made it clear that this was to honour the memory of

                United Kingdom, a Government building will be used to display
                symbols that honour IRA terrorists. Many people find that an
                absolute disgrace. The Sinn Féin representative on the Assembly
                Commission who proposed that lilies should be permitted in
                Parliament Buildings objected to the sale of poppies in this
                very building. It was her view that if poppies could be sold,
                then so should Easter lilies. The money collected would be given
                to the National Graves Association (NGA), which is purported to
                maintain the graves and memorials of those who have, in its
                words, died in the cause of Irish freedom. As Members will note,
                that is an attempt to peddle the lie that there is equivalence
                between the poppy and the lily. It is disgraceful that the
                Assembly Commission has endorsed the view — <i>[Interruption]</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is disgraceful that the Assembly
                Commission has endorsed the view that there can be any
                equivalence between those who died in trenches defending this
                country from anarchy and Nazism and those who died in ditches
                having been killed by their own bombs as they waited to murder
                members of the security forces. The poppy is sold by the Royal
                British Legion to provide support and care for the many
                veterans, both Protestant and Catholic, who served in the two
                world wars. The lily is an IRA symbol sold to maintain memorials
                to dead IRA terrorists. It is an insult to the dead of two world
                wars to attempt to draw any comparison between the poppy and the
                lily.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Easter lily became the symbol of
                remembrance for those who have engaged in terrorist activities
                since 1926. It was adopted by the Republican women’s
                organisation. When the IRA split in 1970 both the Official IRA
                and the Provisional IRA continued to use the Easter lily in
                separate commemorations. Official IRA members wore a lily with a
                self-adhesive backing and became known as &quot;Stickies&quot;,
                while Provisional IRA supporters secured their lilies to their
                lapels with traditional pins.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Easter lilies are sold solely on behalf of
                the National Graves Association. The Easter lily has no other
                symbolism or use. The NGA, founded in 1898, has three main aims.
                I quote from its constitution:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;To restore and maintain the graves of
                the patriot dead of every generation; to commemorate those who
                have died in the cause of Irish freedom; and to compile a record
                of graves and memorials.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The NGA has never deviated from its guiding
                principle that only a 32-county Irish Republic represents the
                true aspiration of those who gave their lives for Irish freedom.
                That is what the lilies are being sold in aid of.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The NGA claims to be a non-political
                organisation. That is interesting. In January 2000 the NGA
                proclaimed that it had succeeded in having the remains of Tom
                Williams released from Crumlin Road Prison. Leading IRA
                activists such as Joe Cahill and Mr Adams, along with Liam
                Shannon from the NGA, carried the coffin of Mr Williams to
                Milltown Cemetery. Why was Mr Williams executed in 1942? He was
                executed for the murder of a Roman Catholic RUC officer, Patrick
                Murphy, whose death left eight children without a father. That
                is the so-called work of the NGA. Over the last three years it
                has supported the erection of a memorial in Dunleath Park in
                Downpatrick in honour of IRA activist Colm Marks. Why did Colm
                Marks die? He was shot by the Army as he attempted to launch a
                mortar bomb into Downpatrick RUC Station.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I notice that Mr McGrady is no longer with
                us, but it would be very interesting to know if he supports the
                work of the NGA in Downpatrick. <i>[Interruption]</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And I have no doubt that the NGA has plans to
                unveil a memorial to Thomas Begley, the Shankill bomber.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Did Mrs Bell know any of that before she
                supported the unveiling of lilies in the Assembly? Did she know
                the association? We are not talking about flower arranging; we
                are talking about emblems that honour dead terrorists.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the Assembly Commission decided to check
                up on the NGA, it discovered some interesting facts. The NGA
                does not have a phone number; it is not a registered charity; it
                does not submit tax returns; and it failed to respond to several
                letters from the Commission. At best, it is a group of deluded
                Nationalists who collect money to commemorate dead terrorists.
                More likely, it is a front for more sinister activities. That is
                what the Easter lily represents.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second part of the motion deprecates the
                abuse of the electoral system that allowed the decision to be
                taken in the first place. No Unionist with all the facts about
                the use of the Easter lily and the work of the NGA would ever
                have voted for the display of the lilies in the House. Votes
                were cast on behalf of one group that — and proof of this
                assertion will be produced later — had made it clear that
                under no circumstances was Mrs Bell or any Alliance Party
                representative permitted to cast votes in the Commission on its
                behalf.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another Member was totally unaware that the
                decision was being made and would not have consented to it. A
                third group was not properly consulted and, once it was made
                aware of what was proposed, immediately withdrew its consent and
                issued a press release denouncing the decision.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Once the full information was in the public
                domain, and all the Unionists in the House knew what was going
                on, to a man they united to oppose the decision. That is why
                they did not permit a second meeting of the Assembly Commission;
                they knew that democracy would prevail and the decision would be
                overturned. Many in the House — and outside — will be
                watching with interest what is going on in the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The original decision set democracy on its
                head. The second meeting resulted in the stymying of democracy,
                because a quorum could not be obtained. It is clear that a
                majority of the House will vote against the disgraceful display
                of lilies in the Great Hall, but the motion will be stymied
                through the use of the petition of concern. So much for
                democracy. So much for taking into account the feelings of
                ordinary grassroots Unionists in this country.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Commission propose to continue with
                the decision and railroad it through without the consent of the
                Assembly? If it intends to do that, then it sets a dangerous
                precedent.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I had the privilege of representing South
                Down in the Assembly between 1982 and 1986. During that time I
                had the sad duty of attending the funerals of 13 members of the
                security forces who had been brutally murdered by the IRA. At
                one of those funerals, there was so little left of a policeman’s
                body that concrete blocks had to be put in the coffin to
                convince his wife that there was a body. There was no body. He
                was blown into a thousand pieces.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly is debating a motion about a
                decision that will allow the Great Hall to be used to honour
                those who committed those foul deeds. The majority of ordinary
                decent people in the Province will never accept that decision.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given the number of Members wishing to

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion. Mr Wells has covered
                the ground very well, but there are questions that need to be
                asked. We must decide whether the importance of the Easter lily
                can be equated to that of the poppy. I, for one, cannot. I see
                the poppy as a national symbol.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the most moving moments of my life was
                when I walked over the field at Thiepval Wood at 7.00&nbsp;am on
                1&nbsp;July some years ago and tried to imagine that morning
                many years before when so many young men lay dead before
                breakfast time. Can I look upon their courage and sacrifice in
                the same way as I look upon those who lie behind hedges, trigger
                bombs, destroy lives and creep away again, some of whom were
                caught and are now to be remembered by the lily? To be honest, I
                cannot. The poppy symbolises something far beyond that which is
                so partisan and so sectarian. That raises a question in my mind
                — should the House be used for the display of partisan
                symbols?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members have agreed that the flax flower
                should be a neutral symbol which we can all adhere to and
                support. Why then are we debating an issue that turns the House
                into a vehicle for the display of partisan symbols? If this goes
                through, the next request, undoubtedly, will be for a display of
                orange lilies around 12&nbsp;July. That raises another question
                — what was really behind the bringing of this matter to the
                Commission at this time? Is it that Sinn&nbsp;Féin is following
                a policy of cultural aggravation? Is it that there is a policy
                of provocation, knowing that Unionists will react in a
                predictable way? Sadly, the end product is that Sinn&nbsp;Féin
                has succeeded in dividing the Assembly on sectarian grounds.
                That is a tragedy when we have all worked and tried in the
                Committees and elsewhere to make progress. I say again that this
                is a tragedy. There will be no winners in today’s debate, and
                the biggest loser will be democracy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I plead with Sinn Féin to consider its
                policy of cultural aggravation. If it begins to hype cultural
                aggravation we will be back again to the killing fields and to
                the divisions that plagued the Province for so many years. Today
                is a sad day for the Assembly. Many people are suffering in the
                community. Their hurt is still real, and their pain is still
                great. We need to think about what we are doing when we raise
                such controversial matters in the Commission. We need to think
                about what we are doing to those who expect us to make progress
                with peace and reconciliation. There is no way in which a matter
                such as this — and I am not talking about the motion before
                the House today, but about the request to have a partisan symbol
                in the House — can help peace and reconciliation. The demands
                of peace and reconciliation cannot be satisfied if we pursue
                this pathway.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those responsible are, of course, the DUP.
                Why? It’s purpose is naked electioneering. It has reconvened
                the House to promote its election campaigns throughout Northern
                Ireland. Let us recognise that today, and let us see it for what
                it is — an abuse of the House.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The substance of the issue is that the
                Assembly Commission has made a reasoned, fair and balanced
                decision. We should recognise that. This was a compromise worked
                out over a series of meetings. Members can see that for
                themselves — the outline, timetable and minutes of those
                meetings are available. The Commission worked very hard indeed
                to reach a consensus on the issue. A fair decision was made, one
                which could not be challenged, and which, I believe would stand
                up to serious scrutiny on independent examination. The
                Commission recognised the problems and the fact that symbols in
                our society are divisive, but sought to reach an accommodation
                which would satisfy everybody.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion, which was accepted by the
                Commission, provided that over the Easter period two floral
                displays in the Great Hall would be replaced by lilies. There
                was no mention of the National Graves Association, collection of
                money, terrorism or of any of the things which Mr Wells has
                brought to the attention of the House today. This was, in
                effect, an inoffensive motion. The Members on the DUP Benches
                take offence, but everyone can see that it is simulated —
                imaginary rather than real. The reality is that the Commission,
                in its wisdom — a Commission that is delicately balanced and
                has made fair decisions since its inception — has worked
                fairly in this instance, as in others.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need to recognise that there are many

                decision is an attempt to do that. It cannot operate effectively
                if its delicate and unique decision-making process is to be
                challenged in this manner by parties who do not get their way.
                The DUP did not get their way, so they are kicking up a row in

                creation of consensual symbols. The SDLP would support that.</p>

                are living in poverty; a crisis in the Health Service — and
                what do the DUP Members do? They bring us back to talk about a
                floral display of Easter lilies at Stormont. That shows where
                the DUP Members’ priorities lie. They have nothing
                constructive to offer but the old, failed politics of the past.</p>

                If people care to look on the Internet or at the records of the
                Commission they will see that this has been an issue since
                November. As Mr Coulter correctly stated, it arose at the same
                time as the issue of poppies. My view was that in the interests
                of parity of esteem and equality, similar provision should be

                debate within the Commission on the issue. At no time was there
                any acrimony over this issue. The matter was debated by the
                Commission at various times; people put forward their points of
                view, and they were listened to. The Commission reached its

                in. However, as an Irish Nationalist and an Irish Republican who
                sits in this House, who is elected by a constituency, who
                represents people and who is part of a community on this island,
                my views and traditions are entitled to equal validity. I do not
                expect Unionists to agree with that, but I do expect them to
                allow me to choose the symbol that I want to represent me. I do
                not want them to tell me what symbols should represent me.</p>

                up to the Good Friday Agreement, which enshrines equality and
                parity of esteem. Unfortunately, yet again, Unionism has failed
                to show generosity to Irish Nationalism and has shown that it is

                because they want to trivialise a debate on an issue that is of
                grave concern. The Easter lily to be displayed in the foyer of
                this Building is quite clearly a symbol of terror. No attempt by
                anyone, including Mrs Bell, to equate it to, for instance, the

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Alban Maginness of the SDLP said that this
                debate has been brought about because of some nonsense on this
                side of the Floor. The history of this debate goes back to when
                Mr Alban Maginness’s party decided to enter into an unholy
                alliance with the Sinn Féin/IRA movement. While he chides this
                side of the House for being afraid to deal with issues, we have
                witnessed over the last number of weeks and months, and no doubt
                will continue to witness through the run-up to the election, the
                SDLP being led by the nose by Sinn Féin on serious, major
                issues such as policing, decommissioning and now terrorist
                symbols.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The SDLP is not able to stand against
                Sinn&nbsp;Féin simply because it is slightly concerned about
                its electoral support. It thinks that playing to the gallery and
                to the nationalist community is likely to gain it a few
                additional votes and stop the meltdown of the SDLP. It will
                engage in whatever tricks, and go through whatever hoops, the
                Sinn Féin/ IRA movement presents it with.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This matter could not have been brought to
                the Commission, and it would not have come onto the Floor of the
                Chamber had it not been for the antics of Mr Maginness and,
                indeed, Mrs Bell of the Alliance Party. She brought forward what
                she termed a &quot;compromise&quot;, but the end result was the
                same — the display of an offensive symbol of terror in the
                Foyer of this public Building.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to Mrs Bell’s role in this,
                there was a misappropriation of votes, as it is quite clearly
                recorded in the Commission’s minutes that both Bob McCartney’s

                available and they should not be referred to on the Floor of the
                House. They are a matter for the Commission, not for the

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are two aspects to Mrs Bell’s hand in
                this. The first issue is the misappropriation of the United
                Kingdom Unionist Party’s vote and my party’s vote. Quite
                clearly, she would not have had the support of either of those
                parties.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Also, it was the foolishness of some of those
                who represent the Unionist community on the Commission that
                allowed this to go through. They gave Mrs Bell the authority to
                claim that she had the majority vote necessary to support the
                motion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, we have in this Chamber today Ulster
                Unionists and others who rushed to sign the petition because of
                the publicity that they were likely to get from it by showing
                how staunch they were in opposing all aspects of Sinn Féin/IRA
                terror and all of their symbols.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is another motion in the Business
                Office which calls for the exclusion of Sinn Féin/IRA from the
                Executive and from the Assembly. The sad fact is that they have
                not rushed to support that motion. What we are witnessing in the
                Hall is a manifestation of the cancer that is within the body
                politic in Northern Ireland — terrorists in government. Is it
                any surprise? What did David&nbsp;Trimble and the Ulster
                Unionists expect when they signed up to the Belfast Agreement?
                They signed up to give these people the right to come into these
                institutions and to propagate their beliefs and to bring these
                symbols of terror into Parliament Buildings.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You cannot play with terrorists. You cannot
                allow those who are inextricably linked to terrorism to come
                into government and then expect them to behave in a
                house-trained, proper and orderly democratic fashion. My appeal
                to the Ulster Unionist party and to the Democratic Unionist
                Party is that if they cannot remove terrorists from government
                then they should remove themselves from the institutions of
                government. It is playing about with those institutions —</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am conscious that we are here on what
                people describe as an emergency — an issue of grave concern to
                the community. Has anyone noticed the sombre tone of those who
                brought this emergency to the Chamber? Has anyone noticed their
                dismay? Rather has anyone noticed their glee and excitement? It
                seems that we may be here for a foolish and unreasonable cause,
                the furtherance of individual hopes and dreams for the election.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some things should be clarified, although
                five minutes, unfortunately, is not a lot of time. We have
                already heard that this issue has been before the Commission
                since November. We were nearly at Easter, and no decision had
                been made. My understanding is that a proposal by Sinn Féin
                concerned the free availability, or the sale, of Easter lilies
                to prove equivalence with the poppy. Another proposal was for a
                bunch of flowers and a card to explain what the Easter lily is.
                Neither of those, I believed, was acceptable. A group of people
                then tried to do what politics is supposed to do — to reach
                some formula that would get us beyond the difficulties that
                epitomise this divided society. What was advocated was that
                there would be two flower arrangements containing — but not
                necessarily solely comprising — Easter lilies. There would be
                no explanation of the Easter lily. In many ways, since the House
                was to have been in recess, one might argue that it was a very
                minimalist response to what was originally requested. It
                achieved enough support to be successful.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are those who would like the Easter
                lily to be treated as equivalent to the poppy, and they are
                matched by those who foolishly allow them to do exactly that.
                They should not be mentioned in the same book, never mind in the
                same sentence. The actions of the DUP, followed on hands and
                knees behind by the UUP, enable Republicans to see this issue
                thrown into abeyance again, to be argued over again and again,
                whether we like it or not. As a Unionist, I have no particular
                desire to appreciate or venerate the Republican dead — some of
                my colleagues and I might like to have added to their ranks. As
                members of the DUP slid about the &quot;Armagh desert&quot; with
                rolled- up manifestos determined to destroy the Republican
                movement, there were those of us who tried to do exactly that,
                more efficiently. I am sorry to say that we did not have as much
                success as I would like to have been able to report. However —

                when Republicans try to stop a people from expressing its

                understand the importance of symbols. Not only in this country,
                but in many other countries, symbols represent ethnic and
                political identity. Indeed, wars have been fought over them. It
                would be hypocritical of Members to go out into the communities
                and expect people to resolve their differences over symbols, if
                they cannot resolve them in this Assembly. That was what the

                parties that could have done something about taking their votes
                away — that there was an opportunity for them to give their
                votes to another party. They could have done that before this
                decision was made. I understand — and the Member is not here

                intimidatory. He asked another Member to go into the shipyard
                and ask people how they would like to be represented. He should
                know that we have had debates in this Chamber about jobs in that
                shipyard. Those jobs do not belong to Protestants or Catholics;
                they are jobs for this community. Mr Wells should be ashamed of
                himself for, in another debate, asking people to go into a
                workplace and find out how they would like to be represented. We
                have legislation in this country about that. Perhaps he would
                also like to address that in his summing-up.</p>

                a mandate to come here. I too, take exception to some of Mr
                Ervine’s remarks, but what he no doubt is pointing to is the
                fact that this was a dirty, rotten war. In that dirty, rotten
                war people fought over how they wanted to be represented. If we
                are to move on, those are the remarks that we should reflect on.
                We should understand now how far we have come, given that we are
                even discussing this issue in the first place.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Bell has my total support. If she did
                anything, she operated in the most democratic way that I have
                seen to date. She actually sent a memorandum around those
                parties that she represents on the Commission and asked us to
                attend an emergency meeting. We all attended that meeting —
                the parties that were represented at the meeting are named —
                and we debated a number of options. The option of selling the
                Easter lily was opposed at this stage. The National Graves
                Association is not a charity. Charities have permission to sell
                their products in the Assembly. That being the case, the next
                option was a display of lilies. That was the option that those
                four parties agreed, and Mrs Bell went to that meeting of the
                Commission and put that consensus and compromise forward. That
                is what won the day, and that is what will still win the day
                when this debate is over.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCartney:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thought that in a fairly lengthy career at
                the Bar I had heard every possible form of hypocrisy, cant and
                dissimulation, but this debate really takes the biscuit. How
                anyone in their right mind can conceivably say that the Easter
                lily, as the Sinn Féin representative described it, is not a
                symbol of Republicanism in all its forms, both democratic and
                violent, is beyond me. For someone to say, as Mr Neeson
                attempted to say, that the Easter lily is a religious symbol
                supervening all other symbols at Easter, is rank nonsense in the
                context of this debate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no doubt that the SDLP shares many
                of the political and irredentist objectives of Sinn Féin. I am
                sure that for many of its members, for private, political and
                electoral purposes, the Easter lily is just as much a symbol of
                their hopes for a united Ireland as it is for Sinn Féin. One
                can therefore understand the view that they take upon it.
                However, for anyone to suggest for a moment that a proposal that
                Easter lilies be displayed within this Building was not
                tantamount to the gravest provocation to those whose relatives,
                friends and political colleagues have been mutilated and
                murdered by the people who hold that Easter lily as a symbol is
                rank hypocrisy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What this debate has enabled me and, I hope,
                the public to see is the democratic values of some of those who
                pontificate in this Chamber, who take a lofty attitude far above
                the likes of those who have a clear party affiliation. I refer
                to Mr Ervine, who unfortunately, while claiming to be a
                democrat, while constantly posturing in the media and speaking
                on the radio about his credentials, actually comes here — and
                for once I am in total agreement with the intervention made by
                Sinn Féin — and suggests that he regrets that he was not more
                successful when wearing his terrorist hat in removing more human
                beings from the face of this earth. That is something that
                everyone here should view with grave disquiet.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am totally and utterly opposed to the
                activities, views and political aspirations of Sinn Féin, but I
                will never ever for one moment countenance that its members be
                dealt with other than in accordance with the rule of law,
                because I am a democrat. In this Chamber I have condemned
                violence, from whatever source it emanates, and the patronising,
                lofty, holier-than-thou attitude taken by some.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All this trouble stems from the fact that a
                symbol of violent Republicanism — a symbol adored and adorned
                by those who have committed the most brutal acts of terrorism
                and violence — is to be displayed in a building allegedly
                dedicated to the democratic process and the observation of the
                rule of law. I have heard much about the inclusiveness of this
                process and that it is a healing process — I heard that today
                from Mr McGrady on the radio — but nothing could be more
                calculated to provoke, to divide and to re-emphasise sectarian
                differences than this proposal.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In conclusion, had the proposal been to fill
                those vases on 01 July with orange lilies, which, like the
                Easter lily, have a specific political connotation, I would have
                objected to that. Anyone who endeavours to equate the poppy with
                either of those symbols is desecrating, misjudging and
                misrepresenting the purpose of the poppy.</p>

                from the SDLP and Sinn Féin, and a very high turnout from the

                very important votes and making very important decisions on
                agriculture and the economy. Their Benches were empty last week,

                actions that he claims he should have taken. That is
                disgraceful. This is the person that the Alliance Party wants to
                side with.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Alliance Party should search its soul

                is down at SD Bell’s. I am not sure where he is, but he is not
                taking part in this debate. He should hang his head in shame, as
                should his party colleagues, for allowing themselves to be
                aligned with people who, quite clearly, are justifying
                generosity to terrorism. That is exactly what they are doing.
                His party colleague, Mrs Eileen Bell, tried to usurp the votes

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The SDLP has been hijacked by Sinn Féin in
                this debate. Its members have never worn Easter lilies on other
                occasions. Weeks before a general election and a local
                government election the SDLP is too frightened to challenge Sinn
                Féin on this issue, to challenge the display of a symbol that
                is akin to the Nazi swastika. It is being used to encourage
                terrorism. It would be placed opposite a plaque that pays homage
                and respect to Edgar Graham and Sir Norman Stronge. That is what
                they are equating this with. But it is not equal to that, and it
                never will be. If Members of the House vote against the motion
                that has been brought by my Colleague, they will not only do
                themselves a disservice, but also do Ulster’s honoured dead
                the gravest disservice.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is a divisive and unnecessary debate.
                The Belfast Agreement was supposed to draw a line under the past
                30 years and allow us to move on. Sinn Féin, however, is acting
                against the ethos of the agreement. It is conducting a form of
                cultural warfare in place of its former occupation. We saw that
                in the run-up to the commemoration of the hunger strikes; we saw
                it yesterday when a plaque was unveiled in Enniskillen of all
                places, an extremely insensitive thing to do. It is hyping the
                tension leading to an election, and Easter lilies are part of
                that cultural warfare campaign.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is accepted that Easter lilies and orange
                lilies are cultural symbols. The poppy is not. The poppy is not
                only a national symbol; it is an international symbol recognised
                across the world as a commemoration of those who made the
                supreme sacrifice in two world wars. These issues should not be
                linked.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sinn Féin needs to appreciate that actions
                such as this damage attempts that are being made to bring us out
                of the past 30 years and damage the confidence that communities
                are trying to build.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to comment briefly on the voting
                system. I was involved in the Standing Orders Committee where
                discussions took place on how the Commission should operate. As
                Members will know, a system was only recently devised that
                everyone was completely happy with. I stand to be corrected, but
                my understanding is that it is based on the number of Members
                who were here on the first day. However, I find it confusing. I
                would welcome Mrs Bell’s explaining how she thought she had
                all the votes that she had in her pocket. The Commission has
                traditionally operated a system whereby decisions are taken on a
                consensual basis. I do not know how we arrived at a position
                where votes were cast for this on behalf of Members who have
                indicated clearly today that they were not in favour of a floral
                display of Easter lilies. Mrs Bell should address this matter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are tearing ourselves apart. It is
                unfortunate that we have had to have this unnecessary debate in
                the lead-up to an election.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to set straight something that Mr
                Wells said at the outset. He said that we were here because the
                Assembly Commission could not meet, as it could not get a
                quorum. I point out to him that I wrote to the Clerk to say
                that, having cancelled all my meetings for that day and
                rearranged a flight home from Brussels where we were discussing
                foot-and-mouth disease, by 5.00 pm on Thursday evening I could
                not ascertain whether the meeting was to be at 11.00 am or 1.00
                pm the following day or which other Members would be attending.
                I could not, therefore, consult all my Colleagues, nor had I the
                luxury of reallocating my votes to anybody else. It was
                impossible for me to attend.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, I fully understand why we are here.

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It goes to the very heart of how we treat
                each other in this institution and the example we give to our
                communities of how society should treat its members. This is
                about inclusion. It is about including all sections of the
                community. It is about recognising the symbols that are dear and
                important to all sections of the community. It is not simply
                about recognising the middle ground; it is about recognising and
                including as far as is possible those people who may have felt
                marginalised or alienated in the past. It is an attempt to
                recognise everybody’s place in the new democratic society in
                which we live.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly Commission, in its decision, was
                extremely conscious of the fact that it was not suggesting
                equivalence — and I certainly would not suggest it — between
                the lily and the poppy, or indeed any other symbol. They are two
                unique symbols that mean something entirely different and are of
                extraordinarily potent emotional significance to different
                sections of the community in which they are held in high regard
                and esteem.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly Commission, in the absence of
                any clear direction, came up with what was very much a
                compromise. We did not accept, under the circumstances, that the
                National Graves Association should be involved or that the
                symbol should be sold in the building. We did accept that the
                Easter lily has a greater significance than that which the
                Republican movement has attached to it. As in the past, when the
                Assembly adopted the flax flower, when poppies for very
                important reasons were available here in November, we felt that
                a benign floral symbol was a sufficient compromise.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In my view, this is about putting up with
                things that we do not necessarily like. This very building is
                anathema to a large section of my community, but we put up with
                it. To many people who visit this building, the statues of
                Carson and Craigavon and other symbols are anathema, but we ask
                them to put up with them — they are part of our history.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly has debated the Union flag on
                many occasions. The Assembly Commission agreed that in the
                absence of any clear direction we would have to put up with the
                fact that it flies over this Building on designated days. We
                have also had a commemoration of the bicentenary of the Act of
                Union, and we have asked Members and visitors to put up with
                that. In divisive circumstances, the Assembly Commission’s
                only option is to try to find a compromise we can all put up
                with. I feel that we achieved that in this case, and we are
                asking the Assembly to put up with that decision.</p>

                This debate is about DUP triumphalism, DUP sectarianism and DUP
                racism. I intervened during David Ervine’s contribution, but I

                of the House who have engaged in violence and sabre-rattling and
                who have attempted to encourage young Protestants — young
                Loyalists — to get involved in violence. They did not do the
                fighting — and I understand where David Ervine is coming from
                in that regard — yet they sit in this House and fancy dress

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Listening to the last Member, one wondered
                for a moment if one was listening to a speech in the Assembly or
                an oration at Milltown.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some Members have said that this is not the
                most important issue facing Northern&nbsp;Ireland, and I agree.
                On the third anniversary of the Belfast Agreement there has
                still been no decommissioning; we have seen the destruction of
                the RUC; there are terrorists in Government; the criminal
                justice system has been damaged; and paramilitaries have
                increasing control of our society. All those issues are more
                important than the motion that is before us today. However,
                those issues, together with a wide range of economic and social
                issues, are dealt with in the day-to-day business of the
                Assembly. This issue is timely because of the approach of Good
                Friday, and it is important for a number of reasons.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, today’s debate highlights the
                weakness of the Assembly’s voting system. Mention has already
                been made of the votes in the Assembly Commission, but there is
                also the absurd sectarian system by which, whether this motion
                passes by one vote or 101&nbsp;votes, it will be negatived
                simply because Nationalists are voting against it. At the time
                of the referendum Unionists were told that their great prize was
                to get power back into their own hands, yet today we find that
                we cannot even pass a motion dealing with Easter lilies because
                of the system.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, a number of parties have shown
                their true colours today. The SDLP is rushing headlong after
                Sinn Féin in the pursuit of electoral success. The Alliance
                Party and the Northern&nbsp;Ireland Women’s Coalition have,
                unfortunately, shown their usual true colours of having greater
                sympathy for the Nationalist cause. The PUP has shown that its
                true bedfellows are Sinn Féin/IRA.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">David&nbsp;Ervine said earlier that he
                regretted not having been more successful. Those were not just
                off-the-cuff remarks. Last night Mr&nbsp;Ervine said on the
                radio that Mr&nbsp;Wells and the supporters of this motion,
                unlike him and others, had not made Republicans cower behind
                steel doors. It is not my ambition in life to make anyone cower
                behind steel doors. I am a democrat, Sir. It ill behoves any
                Member of the Assembly to make that sort of boast —</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member will please direct his comments
                through the Chair.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Weir:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On my third point, I find myself very much at
                odds with Mr&nbsp;Neeson. The Easter lily has been used for a
                political purpose, and it has been used to hijack the true
                meaning of Easter. That is something that borders on the
                blasphemous. Republicans have politicised Easter. We see at one
                extreme the theories of Patrick Pearse — the blood sacrifice
                — which is a clear-cut example of blasphemy. However, to use
                any symbol connected with Easter for a political purpose is to
                deprecate the meaning of Easter and to verge on blasphemy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, the key point is not what
                individuals take as their view; everyone is entitled to take
                whatever action they want. Members opposite are wearing what
                appears to be a Blue&nbsp;Peter-type badge of a cardboard
                cut-out nature. If they want to wear some sort of
                green-and-white badge then that is a matter for them, but what
                we are debating today is the role of the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thought the problem with the notion of
                parity of esteem was that it placed my British citizenship on a
                par with an aspiration towards a united Ireland, thus denying
                the principle of consent; but it is far worse than that. Today
                we are placing the Easter lily, which is a symbol that has been
                associated with violent Republicanism, alongside the symbols
                that commemorate the sacrifice of all people, Catholic and
                Protestant, in the face of fascism. We are equating the soldiers
                who made that sacrifice with cowards who cowered and killed in a
                most despicable way, not just in the past 30&nbsp;years but
                throughout this century, in the name of Irish Republicanism.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Esteem for terrorists is being sought today.
                That is utterly unacceptable and why this motion needs to be
                passed. A clear signal needs to be sent that the ordinary,
                decent people of Northern Ireland — whether Protestant or
                Catholic — simply will not put up with terrorists hijacking
                Easter for their benefit.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion and congratulate the 30
                signatories. The display of Republican triumphalism in the
                Building is deliberately provocative to the vast majority in
                Northern Ireland. It is disgusting that there are those in the
                Assembly who continue to glorify Republican terrorists, and it
                is regrettable that there are puppets of Sinn Féin/IRA.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Very serious questions must be answered. It
                is disgraceful that people such as Seamus&nbsp;Close should
                trivialise the hurt of the Unionist community at Republican
                terrorists being glorified. For Seamus&nbsp;Close to say on the
                radio this morning that this is a meaningless debate about
                flower arranging was mischievous and pathetic when his party
                Colleague, Eileen&nbsp;Bell, appears to have abused the voting
                system. Has Seamus&nbsp;Close conveniently forgotten that he
                told us that the Belfast Agreement would provide open,
                transparent Government? Suddenly Mr&nbsp;Close and the Alliance
                Party are concerned about the cost of the Assembly and his
                holidays being cut short.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would also correct Eddie&nbsp;McGrady, who,
                also on the radio this morning, said that every party is
                represented on the Assembly Commission. Eddie&nbsp;McGrady
                should check his facts. The Northern Ireland Unionist Party is
                not represented, and I wrote to the Alliance Party Whip months
                ago, instructing him not to use our party’s votes on any
                occasion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want an answer today about the role
                Assembly Member Eileen Bell played in the vote last week and on
                previous occasions in the Assembly Commission. We have debated
                for one and a half hours, and there has still been no
                clarification on the voting by the Commission. Did
                Eileen&nbsp;Bell use the three Northern Ireland Unionist Party
                votes in favour of the display of Easter lilies, in spite of
                clear, written instructions to the contrary? Has
                Eileen&nbsp;Bell used the Northern Ireland Unionist Party’s
                votes on previous occasions on any issue, in spite of clear,
                written instructions to the contrary? Did she use a block vote
                of 16, or did she not? If she did, what action will be taken to
                remove Eileen&nbsp;Bell from that position? Is Eileen&nbsp;Bell
                being honest in this matter? She clearly stated on BBC’s ‘Talkback’
                last week that she did not use our party’s votes. Is she
                stating one thing in public and doing the opposite in private?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It should also be noted that the so-called
                parties of the centre — the Alliance Party and the Women’s
                Coalition — are once again supporting Sinn Féin/IRA, as they
                regularly do.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is a wonder that they are not wearing
                their green ribbons and the insulting lily in the Chamber today.
                The Unionist family will also view with dismay — but hardly
                any surprise — the actions of the Progressive Unionist Party
                which, contrary to the wishes of most of its members and
                supporters, is endorsing this display of Republican triumphalism.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today we see the farce that is the Belfast
                Agreement, where a clear majority in the Assembly oppose the
                display of Republican triumphalism, yet the decision of five
                people cannot be overturned. I agree with the Members who
                described Mr Sean &quot;Naive&quot; Neeson’s remark that the
                Easter lily is a symbol of Our Lord’s crucifixion as nothing
                short of blasphemy. It is an absolute disgrace for those in the
                SDLP, Sinn Féin, the Alliance Party, the Women’s Coalition
                and the PUP to equate the poppy, which represents the fallen —
                both Protestant and Roman Catholic — in two world wars, with a
                symbol representing IRA terrorists.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is clear that the Belfast Agreement offers
                nothing for Unionists and must be scrapped. It is rejected by
                the vast majority of Unionists who view it as an appeasement to
                the pan-Nationalist front, and its collapse is inevitable. I
                support the motion.</p>

                when I listened to the comments of Alban Maginness I was

                cowards. I want to remember my schoolmaster colleague Ivan
                Anderson, who was murdered on his way home from work. I want to
                remember the schoolmaster who died a lingering death on a
                trolley, and who had taught my children and my neighbours’
                children. I want to remember my colleague, then headmaster of
                Castlederg High School, whom they attempted to murder on his way
                to work. I want to remember my neighbour and my brother, whose
                lorry was riddled with 49 Armalite bullets on its way to the
                cattle mart in Dungannon. They survived only by the grace of
                God, but they have since departed this life. I want to remember
                the colleagues of my own platoon who served with me in the
                defence of the community. I am proud to record that members of
                that platoon were decent Roman Catholics.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to remind those here today that
                wearers of lily-white lilies of cowardice murdered more Roman
                Catholics than Protestants in the bombing of Omagh on 15 August
                1998. Bear in mind that when they wear their lily-whites of
                cowardice they are not just insulting the blood corpuscles of
                respectability and tributes to everything decent and moral, but
                they are insulting their own religious colleagues whom they have
                slaughtered. Bear in mind that their own party leader ordered
                the suicide of 10 of their own men by hunger strike. That is
                what the lily symbolises. However, it symbolises much more than
                that. That bowl outside in the Hall embodies everything that is
                symbolised in the Belfast Agreement.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My ancient ancestor, Bartholomew Gibson of

                dictatorship and to tramp everyone else’s thoughts and beliefs
                underneath their feet. He made a critical decision. It was said

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion. The placing of Easter
                lilies in Stormont reminds me forcefully of the continuance of
                the terrorist armed struggle in this country. I am reminded in
                particular of the Easter Rising in 1916, which left large parts
                of Dublin in ruins, and of events that have taken place all over
                Ireland then and many times since.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not want to be reminded of that every
                time I walk through the Great Hall. Surely we all want to forget
                the struggles and hate of the past as we move forward? This is a
                deliberate action by persons in this House, a display of their
                terrorist culture.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A fresh start is needed. Everyone should
                acknowledge the need for sensitivity with symbols. In an era of
                bridge-building at the beginning of the twenty-first century,
                this is totally out of keeping and divisive, and it contradicts
                the precepts of the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Belfast Agreement also safeguards
                equality and opportunity. In paragraph 5, it says</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;All participants acknowledge the
                sensitivity of the use of symbols and emblems for public
                purposes, and the need in particular in creating the new
                institutions to ensure that such symbols and emblems are used in
                a manner which promotes mutual respect rather than
                division.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have people in the House who have
                supported terrorist activities. Some still espouse symbols of
                terrorist organisations and are prominent here.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Apart from its distinctive appearance, this
                plant has poisonous characteristics. Researchers say that the
                lily is poisonous to cats and dogs. The toxic contents can cause
                kidney damage to animals, who then require immediate veterinary
                attention. Bearing in mind the problems being experienced by our
                animal population through foot-and- mouth disease and BSE, we
                should not encourage the use of anything that could bring
                suffering or stress to any person or animal.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Easter lilies can be toxic when eaten by a
                cat, causing kidney failure, vomiting, loss of appetite,
                depression and death. Is that the sort of atmosphere that we
                want to work in? My research also shows that unlike the shamrock
                the Easter lily is not a native Irish plant. It comes from the
                Ryukyu Islands, south of Japan, and has no particular Irish
                connection.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This poisonous plant will cause more division
                in the Assembly than anything else. Who would want to be party
                to the placing of such a toxic plant in an accessible place such
                as Stormont? Anyone in his right mind would not want to
                introduce such a poisonous plant, either in Parliament Buildings
                or elsewhere. The Easter lily has no place here — it is a
                symbol of Republicanism.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the Commission’s efforts to adopt
                an inclusive approach to the symbols on display in the building.
                Unfortunately, too many people have lost their lives as a result
                of either state or paramilitary violence. We must respect the
                views of those who have lost family members on what they
                consider to be the most appropriate way of remembering their
                dead. Unfortunately, the debate has been narrow and has focused
                on those who choose either the poppy or the lily as the
                appropriate way in which to honour those who have died.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, those are not the only views; many
                others who have lost family members have entirely different
                opinions on how they should be commemorated. For them, flags and
                flowers have been monopolised and desecrated and made to
                represent something other than was intended. The Union Jack, as
                we know, is based on three Christian crosses. It may symbolise
                something positive, but history tells us that it has sometimes
                been used, or abused, to represent everything but Christianity
                or a coming together. On the other hand, the Easter lily, based
                on the colours orange and green, should symbolise the
                interdependency and coming together of our diverse peoples.
                Sadly, it has taken on a meaning that has more to do with
                physical force and coercion than with promoting peace and
                partnership. That is a matter of regret.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many families do not believe that their loved
                ones should be commemorated by symbols that give rise to
                division. Therefore, a much greater challenge facing us is the
                need to reach agreement on a common symbol to commemorate all
                those who have lost their lives due to violence.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are some reference points that we can
                consider. Let me remind Members of the report by the Northern
                Ireland Commissioner, Sir Kenneth Bloomfield, in April 1998. It
                said that gorse, a plant common in the countryside, which
                flowers in spring, could be a common symbol to commemorate all
                of the victims of violence here. In the Republic of Ireland, a
                victims’ commission considered the views of families who had
                suffered from all over Ireland and ended up recommending a
                common symbol. It suggested that the oak leaf be considered. As
                most people here will know, especially those from around Derry,
                the oak leaf is associated with St Columcille.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I regret that we have had an acrimonious and
                divisive debate on such a sensitive issue. I hope that we will
                quickly turn our attention to the greater problem. We must
                recognise and respect the suffering of all families who have
                lost brothers, sisters, fathers, mothers and other family
                members and reach agreement over how we might commemorate them
                all.</p>

                debate is that the Easter lily is not a minor issue. The
                telephone line from Downpatrick to Crossmaglen must have been
                down last night because the Chief Whip of the SDLP was unable to
                ring Mr Fee to tell him that it is a minor issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Fee let the cat out of the bag when he
                said &quot;Yes, this is a very important issue.&quot; Everyone

                unlike Mr Maskey, who appeared in here this morning in his new
                suit, looked around, realised that everyone else was wearing
                lilies and had to get one photocopied. He arrived in here
                without his lily. He is the only one in Northern Ireland who is

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The most telling silence here this morning
                was from Mrs Eileen Bell, the person mainly responsible for this
                decision. Such was her confidence in the decision that she made
                in the Assembly Commission, that she did not stand up to defend
                herself. She did not stand up to be questioned on the subject.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The point that she did not deny, in any of
                her interventions, was that there were express instructions
                issued that she was not permitted to use the Unionist votes to
                push through the decision to allow the display of lilies. That
                is the only reason that we are here this morning. All the
                arguments that have been made by the opposition fall flat on
                their face. There was an opportunity for Mrs Bell to speak.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If Mrs Bell was confident of how she used her
                votes in the Commission, when a second meeting was called, she
                could have come forward and justified her decision to that
                meeting. However, she realised that if that meeting were called,
                myself and Rev Robert Coulter would have been able to show quite
                clearly, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that there is not consent
                from the Unionist community, as represented in the Assembly, for
                this decision.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are told that we have been sold an
                agreement which says that the consent of the Unionist and
                Nationalist communities must be obtained. There is not a shred
                of consent anywhere in the Unionist community for this decision.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The reality is that, such was their
                enthusiasm to grovel to Sinn Féin, that 22 SDLP Members rushed
                up to Stormont to sign their petition of concern. They did the
                dirty work for Sinn Féin on this occasion. However, the real
                culprit, and the reason why we are here this morning, is the
                so-called middle ground party, the Alliance Party. It seeks to
                speak for both the Unionist and the Nationalist community, yet
                it represents just 2·5% of the electorate. It took it upon
                itself to cast its 16 votes — as all the minutes indicate —
                in favour of the display of these emblems.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Alliance Party was the first to admit
                that when it supported a Sinn Féin Mayor for Belfast it caused
                itself enormous harm electorally. I can tell them that they ain’t
                seen nothing yet, when this gets out to the public. Mrs Bell, I
                am giving you the opportunity to defend yourself, and you have
                not taken it.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to return to a more serious issue.
                There are 2,800 innocent people in their graves today who have
                been put there by those that wear the Easter lily. The money
                that is collected by the sale of the Easter lilies is used to
                honour the people that have tortured this community for 30
                years.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No one connected to the families of any of
                those people is anything but aghast that this is happening.
                Could those 2,800 people ever have known that in Stormont, of
                all places, the people who put them in their graves would be
                honoured through the display of Easter lilies? Would they ever
                have thought that that was possible? That is what we are voting
                for today. It does not have consent.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I call on the Alliance Party to apologise to
                the decent people of this Province for getting us into this
                situation. Votes were abused, Members were not consulted and
                decisions were taken behind closed doors without the consent of
                the parties whose votes were being used. Clearly, there has been
                abuse. There has been abuse throughout the entire system. This
                decision, if it is allowed to go ahead, will be a gross insult
                to the innocent people of this Province who have been murdered
                by the IRA.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no equivalence with the poppy. I am
                glad that Members, particularly from other parties, have taken
                the opportunity to explain the fundamental difference between
                the symbolic natures of the poppy and of the Easter lily. The
                only equivalent to the Easter lily would be some emblem on
                behalf of Loyalist Prisoners’ Aid, or some similar
                organisation. We, as a party, would not support that and we are
                certainly not supporting this.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I come back to this question: is the
                Commission prepared to fly in the face of the decision of the
                House, or will it honour that decision? Let democracy prevail.
                Let us see what the House decides this afternoon. Any proposal
                that honours those dead who have lain in ditches and blown up
                totally innocent people because they were Protestants — or
                because they were Catholics — has no support from any decent
                person in this Province.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I assure my Colleague that that person in the
                Chamber — or who was in the Chamber — who purports to
                represent Unionism, but who has supported the commemoration of
                the Easter rebellion through the display of lilies, does not
                represent the Unionists of East Belfast. They do not want to be
                represented by &quot;Easter lily Ervine&quot;.</p>

                about true Unionists with true, traditional Unionist values. In
                conclusion, if we approve the display of Easter lilies in the
                House, we insult the names of the brave dead of this province,
                and the people of Northern Ireland will not forgive those

                jumping up and demanding five or 10&nbsp;minutes each to reply.
                I ask you to look at this very seriously. We must have a system

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker, what you said was that it
                would have to be after the debate. It would be so far after the
                debate that the aggrieved Member would have to write out a
                statement. That statement would have to be ruled to be in order
                by the Speaker, and it would have to be read out in the very
                words that the Member had submitted to the Speaker. There would
                be no confusion if that were rigidly adhered to.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, in a debate where there is cut and
                thrust, the only time that a Member can make a personal
                statement is if they have been accused by an opponent of
                something that is outside the law. That is the only time that a
                Member can intervene and say &quot;No.&quot; In today’s debate
                Mr Wells gave Mrs Bell an opportunity to stand up and explain
                her situation, but she did not do that. Therefore, she does not
                have much to worry about, even though she did collogue earlier
                with Gerry Adams and others on his Bench.</p>

                However, I have to say that I sought advice this morning about
                what I should do. I did not particularly want to take part in
                the debate, because I knew what would happen, but I did want to
                comment on the many inaccurate statements that have been made in
                relation to the voting procedure. I was told at that stage that
                if I handed in a statement I would be allowed to make a
                statement on the facts after the vote had been taken. I have now
                been told — and I accept the Deputy Speaker’s decision —
                that that cannot be done. I am sorry that my reputation has been
                sullied by that, and I want this matter cleared up. Can the

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker, you are quite right — I
                am not going to comment on the debate. Mr&nbsp;Wells,
                Mr&nbsp;McFarland and others have made a number of allegations
                about the voting procedure. It has been said that I cast votes
                on behalf of a group that had made it clear to me that no Member
                from the Alliance Party was entitled to vote on its behalf.
                Mr&nbsp;Wells should have said that I acknowledged that at the
                time. I also acknowledged that I was unable to get in touch with
                Mr&nbsp;McCartney, and that I did not wish to cast votes for
                either the NIUP or Mr&nbsp;McCartney. When I subsequently got in
                touch with Mr&nbsp;McCartney, he confirmed that he did not want
                his vote to go either way.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was also said that another group was not
                properly consulted and subsequently issued a press release to
                denounce my amendment. I convened a meeting of the Alliance
                Party, the PUP and the Northern&nbsp;Ireland Women’s
                Coalition. The UUAP was represented by its Leader. I agreed the
                substance of my amendments with other parties at that meeting.
                Therefore, that was the amendment.</p>

                vital part of the issue is the fact that Mrs Bell did not turn
                up to a meeting of the Commission at which the matter could have
                been put right. She has given no explanation for that at all.
                Why did she arrange a meeting and then boycott it?</p>
