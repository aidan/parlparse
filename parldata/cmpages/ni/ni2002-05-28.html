              Investment Companies Bill (NIA 10/01) be agreed.</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Following the legislative changes on economic
              development that led to the establishment of Invest Northern
              Ireland, the Department is focused on updating Northern Ireland
              company law with a series of legislative measures. The Open-Ended
              Investment Companies Bill is the latest of the four company law
              measures that I am bringing to the Assembly during the current
              session. It is the most technical of the four Bills, but,
              nonetheless, it is an important measure for the financial
              investment sector in Northern Ireland. The Bill will ensure that
              Northern Ireland investment firms have the same opportunities for
              open-ended investment companies (OEICs) as their competitors in
              Great Britain, thus removing any potential disadvantages to the
              local investment sector.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To help those Members who are unfamiliar with
              the subject, I will provide a broad definition of the nature of an
              OEIC. An OEIC invests in securities, such as the shares of other
              companies. It issues shares to its investors, and the value of
              that capital may go up or down as shares are either issued or
              cancelled. A fund manager, who must be authorised by the UK
              Financial Services Authority (FSA), manages its investments.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The assets of, or investments owned by, an OEIC
              must be held by a depositary, who must also be authorised by the
              FSA. The depositary plays a key role, similar to that of a unit
              trust trustee, and must be legally independent of the directors of
              the OEIC. Details of the performance of individual OEICs are
              regularly reported in the financial pages of the broadsheet
              newspapers.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Owning shares in an OEIC is an efficient and
              flexible means of investing in equities and other securities, with
              all the opportunities for capital growth that that entails. By
              pooling their investments, an OEIC’s shareholders can invest
              more cheaply than if they owned shares directly, while at the same
              time spreading their risks and using expert fund managers. That
              means that OEICs can extend the benefits of wider share ownership
              to investors who lack the expertise, time, resources or
              inclination to choose their own stocks.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The current legislation for the regulation of
              OEICs in Northern Ireland provides only for the operation of the
              type of company permitted by Directive 85/611/EEC on Undertakings
              for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS). Non-UCITS
              OEICs offer a wider range of investment schemes, including money
              market and property funds and funds of funds. The investment fund
              management sector in the UK argued that it would be desirable for
              the Government to legislate for the establishment of non-UCITS
              OEICs in the UK to ensure the continued success of the OEIC as a
              UK investment instrument. The UK Government legislated for that
              change in the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, which
              applies to Great Britain only. The Open-Ended Investment Companies
              Bill proposes to extend to the Northern Ireland investment sector
              the ability to form OEICs whose investment powers would take them
              outside the scope of the UCITS Directive, enabling them to offer
              the extended range of open-ended investment schemes.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second effect of the Bill is to transfer
              the registration of Northern Ireland OEICs from the Northern
              Ireland Companies Registry to the FSA. That would mean that, as
              well as regulating OEICs in Northern Ireland, the FSA would be
              responsible for maintaining a register of them. Under existing
              regulations, the Northern Ireland Companies Registry undertakes
              the registration of OEICs, while regulation is undertaken by the
              FSA.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those arrangements constitute a cumbersome and
              unnecessary splitting of responsibilities. The new provisions, in
              the form of draft Regulations that will come before the Assembly,
              will, therefore, represent a significant rationalisation that
              benefits the local investment sector. That is because the
              Financial Services Authority will act as a single point of contact
              for OEICs in the United Kingdom.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The third effect of the Bill is to enable the
              creation of Regulations that will further simplify the governance
              of OEICs. Those will make provisions for OEICs broadly the same as
              those for unit trusts, provisions that are contained in the
              Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. Therefore, there should
              be no significant divergence in the Regulations that govern unit
              trusts and OEICs. That will help investors because OEICs and unit
              trusts are similar investment vehicles, and such divergence could
              cause confusion. The proposed subordinate legislation will be laid
              in the Assembly if the Bill is passed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The decision to register an OEIC will continue
              to be voluntary, based on commercial consideration. The Bill is
              intended to offer an extended choice of OEICs to the investment
              fund management sector in Northern Ireland, similar to that which
              is available in Great Britain. The Bill will also streamline the
              arrangements for registration and regulation under a single body,
              the Financial Services Authority.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Enterprise, Trade and
              Investment will also ensure that investors in the new type of OEIC
              are protected. That will be done by drafting Regulations that will
              ensure that those companies are governed by the same standards of
              investor protection that apply to authorised unit trusts. Although
              no OEICs are registered in Northern Ireland, the Bill represents
              my Department’s commitment to keep the legal framework for
              businesses here at the forefront of international best practice.
              The Bill achieves that by giving Northern Ireland’s investment
              sector the opportunity to take advantage of the extended range of
              OEIC investment vehicles. That demonstrates that Northern Ireland
              is a modern economy, anchored in legislation that creates the
              conditions that allow business to develop and prosper.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Wells:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is not the most glamorous of subjects to
              speak about, but it is important. I welcome the legislation.
              Departmental officials briefed the Committee for Enterprise, Trade
              and Investment well on the matter, and the Committee asked the
              relevant questions on how the legislation would affect investors
              in Northern Ireland. The Committee unanimously decided that the
              legislation should be supported, so I do not intend to pick holes
              or complain about it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Open-ended investment companies are
              affectionately known as OEICs, which is an unfortunate acronym.
              They succeed the old unit trusts, and many Members are investors
              in unit trusts. I must declare an interest — I hold four
              investments in OEICs. The returns were substantial until the
              events of September 11, and the rapid decline of share prices
              since that date has meant that the Jim Wells benevolent fund has
              taken a series of knocks from which I do not know if it will
              recover. Therefore, I have direct experience of investment. As
              everyone knows, under the old unit trust system there were bid and
              offer prices, and the spread was normally 5% to 5·5%. There is a
              single, transparent pricing system under OEICs that means that
              investors will know almost immediately the value of their funds.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the Minister said, fund information is
              published regularly. Indeed, it is published daily in ‘The Daily
              Telegraph’ and the ‘Financial Times’. Therefore, investors
              will know the value of their holdings within a day and can
              calculate it by multiplying the number of units that they hold by
              the price quoted in the newspaper.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The legislation is permissive; Northern Ireland
              institutions do not offer OEICs. The legislation simply enables
              companies such as Northern Bank, First Trust Bank, et cetera, to
              establish those funds if they wish. We should have no difficulty
              in supporting that, as this is parity legislation.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">10.45 am</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Shares in OEICs are regulated in exactly the
              same way as in unit trusts, so investors are protected. I am glad
              that the Financial Services Authority (FSA) has provided a
              rigorous and high standard of protection to investors. There has
              been only one recent example of skulduggery, and, as soon as it
              was discovered, the FSA acted quickly to rectify the situation.
              All investors, including myself, were put back into the same
              position that they would have been in had the discrepancy not
              arisen. We can progress with a great deal of confidence that this
              part of the financial market is well regulated, and so this
              technical change does not undermine investors’ confidence in
              these vehicles.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is unfortunate that there is limited
              investment in unit trusts, OEICs and investment trusts in Northern
              Ireland. As the Minister said, this is an excellent way of gaining
              exposure to the stock market without the risk inherent in
              investing in one or two companies. Only when people here have a
              wider interest in investing in the stock market will Northern
              Ireland start to establish its own venture capital trusts and
              other vehicles that invest directly in Northern Ireland firms. We
              tend to be somewhat conservative and put our money under the bed,
              which I cannot understand. We tend to put money safely into
              deposit accounts in banks where it gains a poor rate of interest
              and does nothing for investment in our industry.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Aside from those minor points, the House should
              support this legislation. I hope that it will be enacted in time
              for financial institutions in Northern Ireland to set up OEICs.
              Perhaps, one day, one of those funds will invest entirely in
              shares of Northern Ireland companies, which would enable Northern
              Ireland people to invest directly in the future of the Province.
              The present difficulty is that we have quite a narrow base. Even
              our largest company, Viridian, would be very small in the scheme
              of things on the London Stock Exchange. However, I hope that, as
              there are already funds that invest entirely in Scottish companies
              or Belgian companies, we will have an OEIC that will invest
              entirely in Northern Ireland, so that people can have a stake in
              the well-being of our plcs.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The acronyms are difficult to wrestle with. I
              note that the Member’s benevolent fund took a dive after 11
              September. However, we are all confident that a sufficiently broad
              back can withstand such pressures and that it will emerge
              triumphant in due course. The question is how some of us can get a
              slice of it. Joking aside, the Member made a serious point. We all
              recognise that we have a grossly underdeveloped financial services
              sector. The Republic concentrated on attracting financial services
              to its new centre in Dublin, which was successful.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department has a commitment to ensuring
              that our legislation meets best practice and international
              standards. While there are currently no companies trading in this
              fashion, that will not always be the case, so we must ensure that
              our legal framework is modern, up-to-date and has the benefit, as
              the Member pointed out, of ensuring that the interests of
              consumers are protected. We must remember that people may be
              investing their life savings in such companies.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People suffered shocks in recent years after
              investing in shareholdings through endowment mortgages and other
              forms of investment. They experienced shortfalls. It is most
              important to ensure that consumers are protected, so the
              involvement of the Financial Services Authority (FSA) and the
              streamlining of the administrative processes for establishing and
              registering these companies, under the remit of the FSA, is a
              positive development that avoids duplication and will ensure that
              Jim Wells’s benevolent fund will grow and prosper.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Women’s Coalition is moving this motion
              because the time is right for debate to be opened on the practice
              of public representatives holding more than one elected position.
              With elections to the Assembly due in less than a year and the
              long-awaited review of public administration and local government
              gathering momentum, we need to send a clear message to the
              electorate that things will change for the better under this
              Administration. As far as the Women’s Coalition is concerned,
              changing for the better means ending what we describe as the
              unacceptable practice that allows elected representatives to hold
              dual, and even multiple, mandates.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Women’s Coalition believes that the
              principle of one member, one mandate is fundamental to best
              democratic practice. In fact, we absolutely fail to understand how
              the practice of one person holding a number of elected positions
              is tolerated either by parties, within Governments, or by the
              public at large. Figures that are available for all to see show
              that some Assembly Members hold as many as three elected
              positions. According to the figures that research has supplied to
              me, out of 108 Members, 60 are councillors, 12 are MPs and one is
              an MEP. Also, a total of five hold three elected positions.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need to think about what that means in terms
              of time, energy and commitment, about the responsibilities of an
              elected position and about whether it is possible for one person
              to carry out two or even three full-time elected roles. We are
              talking about separate locations, involving air travel, overnight
              accommodation and extremely demanding responsibilities — huge
              responsibilities, as we have found. Is it right that this practice
              of people stretching themselves to the limit and spreading
              themselves too thinly should continue, and is the service being
              provided correctly?</p>

              between Unionists and Nationalists. Mr Ken Robinson made the point
              that if we are striving for equality in the truest sense of the
              word, and if we want to increase democratic participation, we
              should be freeing up those positions to encourage more women,
              younger people, those from ethnic minorities and many others to
              come forward and become involved in politics so that it is truly

              positions are being hoarded, and we kid ourselves, our parties and
              the electorate that no one else could do the job better. If

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the new legislation is eventually
              introduced, some 60 Assembly Members who are also local
              councillors are going to find themselves in a very unusual
              position. If the proposals are accepted, they will be voting to
              give local government more power, more work and increased
              remuneration. We do not have to look too far to see what
              legislatures beyond this jurisdiction are doing. It has been
              recognised that holding a dual mandate is no longer accepted
              practice. In Scotland and Wales the need to reduce that practice
              has been acknowledged, and only a few stalwart Members are left
              working as local councillors or MPs.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At community level, a motion has been passed in
              the European Parliament, pointing out that dual mandates are
              incompatible, and that holding them will be discouraged from 2004.
              However, the UK has secured derogation from that until 2009.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There may not be much sympathy on the floor of
              the Assembly for the motion, given the number of councillors

              Morrice’s speech and motion, though I would qualify them
              somewhat. We are all aware of the public disquiet about the levels
              of reward or salary for MLAs and the perceived productivity or
              effectiveness of public representatives in Northern Ireland,
              especially in the Assembly. Some of that is to do with perception,

              complacent.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is clear evidence that a multiple mandate
              leads to a reduction in the attendance of those individuals who
              are members of a variety of institutions. For example, recent
              attendance statistics for the European Parliament show that our
              party’s representative, Mr Jim Nicholson, attends between 80%
              and 90% of debates in the Parliament in Strasbourg — that is
              because he has a single mandate. In contrast, the attendance
              records of our two other MEPs, Dr Paisley and Mr Hume, are much
              poorer. Their attendance rates are about 40% to 50% — about half

              councillors experience. I am not a councillor, but 60 of our 108
              Members are. Experiences and responsibilities clearly overlap in
              the two levels of government. However, some individuals who are
              both councillors and MLAs can do both jobs well — they find them
              mutually supportive.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Councillors are not paid a salary, so it cannot

              receive some expense payment, albeit a relatively small amount.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must bear in mind that we are at a
              transitional point. The Assembly is a new institution and, until
              relatively recently, there were some doubts about its survival.
              Given that, it is understandable that many councillors were also
              elected as MLAs. However, it should be the long-term aspiration of
              all parties to strive to reach the position where, as far as
              possible, councillors are not MLAs and vice versa.</p>

              not the cause of failure to maintain a quorum in Committee
              meetings. Many of us have observed the phenomenon that occurs in
              Committees at 4.00 pm or 4.30 pm when certain Members leave
              because they have a council meeting to attend that evening.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Potential conflicts of interest will arise, two
              of which have already been mentioned: the recent Local Government
              (Best Value) Bill and the forthcoming review of local
              administration. The public will perceive that councillors who are
              also MLAs have a conflict of interest. That also applies to
              Ministers who are councillors, although I understand that the
              ministerial code of practice makes some provision for that. With
              the various qualifications attached, I support the motion.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first thing that struck me about the motion
              is that its first line calls for recognition of the volume of work
              involved in serving the various institutions. It occurs to me that
              much of the work of public representatives goes unrecognised. It
              is important that we recognise the volume of work that public
              representatives, by and large, carry out in all the roles that we
              are considering.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The burden is particularly onerous on Members
              of the Assembly, Members of Parliament at Westminster and Members
              of the European Parliament. The SDLP agrees with that part of the
              motion. My party recently changed its constitution to enable it to
              work towards that position. Mandates gained should be recognised
              and cannot be denied. A mandate has authority, and it will take
              time for any change to filter through. Therefore as a party we
              aspire to such a position on those responsibilities.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are several reasons why we disagree,
              however, with the inclusion of local government in the motion. The
              concept of public service is crucial in local government. It is
              not a job in the sense that the motion refers to
              &quot;double-jobbing&quot;. It is certainly not a salaried job.
              Those of us who have been councillors for many years have done so
              while continuing with our normal working lives. That is what
              public service means. We should not attempt to deny that concept;
              it is valuable, and we should try to ensure that it is maintained.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Member agree, in the spirit of that
              public service, that the former leader of his party and the leader
              of my party, and others, by working so tirelessly over the years,
              delivered a peace package of millions of pounds for Northern
              Ireland under the Delors scheme, which provided a foundation for
              this community to go forward; and that if they had left it to
              others, we would still be waiting for that money to be delivered?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr ONeill:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yes. Indeed, Mr Ken Robinson also mentioned the
              importance of public service over the past 30 years, and the
              commitment of people to deliver for the community at every level.
              That should also be recognised. However, my comments were
              particularly concerned with the public service element of local
              government.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Perhaps the proposer’s party does not have as
              much experience or involvement in local government as others in
              the House. It is understandable that its members may not fully
              appreciate the concept of asking people to give of their time to
              serve the community at local government level. To describe the
              work of local government as &quot;jobbing&quot; of any kind is a
              contradiction, and it does not sit well with my party. We will,
              therefore, oppose the motion on those grounds.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My personal view, not necessarily shared by all
              my Colleagues, is that the Assembly and local government are in
              danger of becoming too separate. It could become a case of
              &quot;us and them&quot;. That would not be healthy. At least, in
              the interim period, one of the best ways of ensuring that that gap
              does not widen is the involvement of Members at both levels.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In that way, we can ensure that this
              institution and local councils work together rather than in
              opposition. If people do not take that as a credible point, they
              should consider the conflict between central Government and local
              government in England, which has been clearly documented over the
              past 20 or 25 years, and note how destructive a gap a &quot;them
              and us&quot; syndrome can be. I see some merit in Members also
              serving in local councils, at least in the short term.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with many of the remarks made by Mr
              ONeill. Unlike Dr Birnie, I will be resolutely opposing the
              motion, and I hope that I will carry the support of many Members.
              Judging from the interventions of many of his Colleagues, Dr
              Birnie may also find that many Ulster Unionists will oppose the
              motion; that is for them to decide.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I oppose the motion on three grounds: it is
              anti-democratic; it is hypocritical; and it aims at the wrong
              target. It may be a very old-fashioned view in the new
              dispensation, but I happen to believe that people get the
              politicians that they deserve and the politicians that they vote
              for, and the best system is to allow people to vote for whomever
              they want. Any attempt to impose standards that specify that
              people should serve in only one Chamber and should not be allowed
              to run for a second Chamber — or have to give one up if they are
              elected to it — is profoundly undemocratic.</p>

              people being allowed to vote for whomever they want, but does he
              not admit that the party decides on the person that the electorate
              vote for?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Weir:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The electorate votes for the individuals that
              it wants. It can vote for candidates representing a range of
              political parties, and that is democracy. Anything that tampers
              with that is profoundly undemocratic. We should not be surprised
              that the Women’s Coalition is taking up an anti-democratic
              stand. After all, this is the same party that mothered the Civic
              Forum, for whose members not a single vote was cast, and whose
              achievements can be written on the back of a postage stamp.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When we went through the charade of the
              election of the First Minister last November, that same party was
              rehearsing for the pantomime even before the Alliance Party had
              donned the pantomime horse’s clothes. I should not therefore be
              surprised by an anti-democratic proposal from the Women’s
              Coalition. I am also disappointed in the motion on the grounds
              that it is hypocritical because, if she were here today, the
              proposer’s leader could vouch for the fact that she stood for
              election to Westminster, presumably on the basis that she would
              have some sort of dual mandate.</p>

              way, and for a certain amount of toing and froing, but it begins
              to become inappropriate when those who have either already made
              speeches, or have the opportunity to make further speeches,
              intervene repeatedly. If this were the Committee Stage of a Bill,
              that would not be unreasonable. However, I must ask Members who
              have the opportunity to speak not to make interventions in this
              way, but to restrain themselves, marshall their points and bring
              them to the Chamber at a suitable time. Otherwise, it all gets
              completely out of order.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Weir:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proposer’s leader aside, my Colleague Mr
              Paisley Jnr has already highlighted the sheer hypocrisy of the
              position. The proposer of the motion is also double-jobbing on the
              Laganside Corporation. I gather that the pay is around £7,500 a
              year, but I was not aware that it was for only one morning a
              month. Perhaps the Member will be changing her name by deed poll
              to Naomi Campbell, given the rates of pay that she seems to
              expect. I understand the high degree of overlap between local
              councils and the Assembly where much of the work is basically the
              same.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a public representative, one deals with
              constituency complaints. I fail to see a direct correlation
              between being a member of Laganside Corporation and representing
              North Down in the Assembly. On behalf of the constituents of North
              Down, I cannot see that they have gained advantages to the tune of
              £7,500 from Jane Morrice’s being a member of Laganside
              Corporation. I look forward to the announcement of her resignation
              from that board in her winding-up speech, if she truly believes in
              the spirit of the motion.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion is targeted wrongly, because there
              is an overlap between the various jobs that public representatives
              do. However, that is recognised by the fact that MLAs who are also
              MPs receive only one third of their Assembly salary, because much
              of their Assembly work overlaps with work in Westminster. There is
              a large overlap between council work and Assembly work, and it
              would be a shame if we were to become completely detached from
              local government.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no correlation between the amount of
              work that people do and their having one mandate or two. Since the
              last general election, the majority of my party’s MPs who are
              also MLAs have had a better voting record in the House of Commons
              than David Burnside, who is a single mandate MP. All my party’s
              MPs have a better voting record than Jeffrey Donaldson.</p>

              is not appropriate to mention Members of other places by name who
              cannot defend themselves. Members may choose to refer to such
              matters in a less definite way, but they must not refer to Members
              by name. Members of this House would think it inappropriate if
              they were mentioned by name in other places and found it
              impossible to respond in a proper parliamentary fashion. I ask the
              House to observe that.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Weir:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In that spirit, Mr Speaker, one Member of my
              party, who is an MLA and an MP, has a voting record that is 80
              times greater than that of a former leader of another party in
              this House who was formerly an MLA. There is no direct correlation
              between someone’s being a single mandate representative and the
              job being done properly. One MP has voted against her own party on
              24 occasions. One questions whether that is a good use of time. A
              former MP, who has now been replaced by someone who is also an MLA
              representing a constituency to the north of our current location,
              was noted for his poor attendance and poor work at Westminster. I
              am surprised that the American security forces are not searching
              his former offices for Osama bin Laden, who could hide there
              without any trouble.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During a former period of devolution, from 1921
              to 1972, it was standard practice for people to be MPs either at
              Stormont or Westminster. There has been critical comment,
              especially from the Unionist Benches, that the Unionist case
              suffered — and by extension the Northern Ireland case— because
              a second eleven was often being sent to Westminster. However, I
              want to praise a former Stormont and Westminster MP, Lord Fitt,
              who had a greater impact at Westminster in the 1960s than many MPs
              who were there with a single mandate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion is targeted wrongly, because the
              Assembly is based on the examples of Scotland and Wales. If we had
              managed to get Northern Ireland down to the proportionate level of
              representation that exists in Scotland and Wales, perhaps there
              would be some merit in Members having more than one mandate. The
              Scottish Parliament has approximately 20% more Members than this
              Assembly, yet it represents three times the population. Wales has
              the twice the population of Northern Ireland. However, the total
              number of Welsh Assembly Members and MPs is still less than the
              number of Members in the Northern Ireland Assembly. Northern
              Ireland is overrepresented in the Assembly, but not at
              Westminster. However, Northern Ireland cannot afford the luxury of
              having people representing the electorate in only one body.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of much greater concern is not that Members sit
              in more than one Chamber — they are doing the same job in each;
              it is the number of Members who have served on quangos. Ms Morrice
              is the ideal example. At least councillors, MPs, MEPs and Assembly
              Members are people who do similar jobs, have similar levels of
              representation and deal with similar problems. When a person
              visits his constituency office, or contacts an Assembly Member, he
              does not delineate his problem as an Assembly matter, a council
              matter or a parliamentary matter: he wants public representation.
              It is much more serious when people are double-jobbing through
              employment in quangos. The Assembly should investigate that issue
              more closely than the one proposed in the motion.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What ultimately lies behind the motion? It
              could be naivety on the part of the Women’s Coalition; however,
              that remains to be seen. Ms Morrice told the Assembly that it is
              about &quot;freeing up&quot; jobs and opportunities. I believe
              that it is about freeing up opportunities for the Women’s
              Coalition. That party has an abysmal record of failure in
              elections. It managed to get only two people elected to the
              Assembly and one to a local council. Together with its proposal to
              limit the period in which councillors can serve to two terms, the
              Woman’s Coalition is attempting to knock out of some of the
              political &quot;big hitters&quot; in various parties to give
              itself a much better chance of being elected to the Assembly and
              local councils. That is what lies behind the motion. I urge
              Members to reject the motion because it is anti-democratic,
              hypocritical and wrongly directed.</p>

              motion is really about service delivery; and to that end it is
              somewhat disparaging. However, all parties should consider it. One
              can understand why such a motion, and the questions it raises,
              finds its way to the Assembly Floor. All Members have experienced
              the negative aspects of political double acts that have been part
              and parcel of local politics for more than 50 years. It is hard
              for some parties to break the mould.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion raises the issue of the ability of
              elected representatives to carry out their work effectively if
              they are doubling up on jobs — Ms Morrice and other Members have
              mentioned that. Proper methods of accountability should sort out
              that matter. However, the motion also questions the integrity and
              intelligence of the electorate who have elected politicians to
              jobs in local councils, the Assembly and Westminster — and will,
              possibly, elect representatives to Dáil Éireann.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion implies that it is not humanly
              possible for one person to perform the roles of councillor,
              Assembly Member and MP and give effective service to their
              constituents. That may be the case for some individuals. Although
              Members acknowledge the volume of work involved in the Assembly,
              they must also acknowledge that there are politicians who are
              dedicated to the electorate and who have successfully managed to
              combine their various elected roles and give their constituents
              the benefit of both worlds.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will not.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have all heard the single-transferable
              speeches, just as we have witnessed poor quality of service to the
              electorate. In principle, Sinn Féin supports the concept that one
              elected position is the preferred option.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, that is predicated more on the notion
              of stability than that of capability. For practical reasons,
              parties have chosen, to stand for seats in the Assembly,
              candidates who, in many instances, have already proven that they
              are electable and who have a good track record in local
              constituency work.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Therefore, it could be argued that the motion
              is not only about capability, but stability. Those who are sincere
              and who believe in democracy would, if given the choice, prefer a
              more focused and, perhaps, single workload. The problem is not
              just about doubling up; it is about making politics work,
              regardless of whether a person holds one job or two. It is to the
              shame of some parties in the Assembly that we cannot hold up this
              institution as an example of making politics work. Few elected
              representatives, if given the choice, would have abandoned their
              constituencies in the past four years, given the Assembly’s
              instability.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should cast our minds back to the public
              outcry over whether Members should be given a pay rise, regardless
              of whether we double up. The public pronouncements on that were
              not complimentary. On the whole, people said that we did not
              deserve a penny because nothing happens in this place — they do
              not say that nothing happens in local councils or at Westminster.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The real issue is not whether we double up, or
              do one job or three jobs. It is whether we are good at the job to
              which we have been elected. The people elected us in the first
              place to uphold and strengthen the Good Friday Agreement.
              Regardless of whether we have a single job or whether we double
              up, we are doing that job well. The jury is still out on that
              matter.</p>

              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sinn Féin has given the matter considerable
              thought. We have examined whether holding seats on local councils,
              in the Assembly and at Westminster provides an adequate voice for
              the Republican electorate who have given us their mandate, which
              is to pursue our political agenda on an all-Ireland basis. That
              mandate will change the political landscape on this island and on
              our neighbouring island. How we progress our agenda and whether we
              hold two or three elected posts is worked through our party’s
              strategy.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several Sinn Féin councillors, myself
              included, have resigned our seats on local councils, having worked
              out with other parties a mechanism for co-option to ensure that
              the quality of service to the electorate is not diminished or
              interrupted. We continually examine matters, not least the
              conflict of interest between local councils and the Assembly. We
              are also obliged to continually assure our electorate that the
              transfer of power from Westminster will produce better local
              democracy. However, that remains debatable.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although we support the motion in principle, we
              shall abstain from voting for it, for several reasons. The
              principle of co-option in local government, specifically on
              Unionist-dominated councils, has not been firmly established. The
              Assembly is still sitting on the Unionist San Andreas fault, with
              the threat of a seismic split just around the corner. However,
              there is an advantage in giving the decisive power to the people.
              They had the choice in the first place and have judged that their
              local elected representatives can represent their interests on
              councils, in the Assembly, in Dáil Éireann and at Westminster.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Choice should be restricted only where there is
              good reason. There is no legal or constitutional impediment to
              candidates offering themselves for positions — in the final
              analysis it is the people who have the choice. Go raibh míle

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In declaring an interest, I place on record
              that I was elected to Lisburn Borough Council, now Lisburn City
              Council, in 1973. I was re-elected in 1977, 1981, 1985, 1989,
              1993, 1997 and 2001. I am honoured and privileged to have served
              the electorate of that august city for 29 consecutive years and
              now to be in my thirtieth consecutive year of elected position.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Close:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Others in the Chamber can also take a bow on
              achieving a wonderful record, and I applaud them.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Why has Séamus Close been on Lisburn Borough
              Council, now Lisburn City Council, for 30 years? A couple of
              answers spring to mind. People may wish to suggest others, but the
              two fundamental reasons are that Séamus Close decided to put
              himself forward to the electorate and that the electorate, for
              better or worse, decided to elect him. If a mistake was made in
              1973, the electorate has had many opportunities to rectify it. It
              has decided, however, to elect and re-elect Séamus Close. That is
              democracy in practice.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I maintain that I am a democrat. I believe in,
              and respect, the voice of the people. It is my prerogative to
              think that at times they may have got it wrong, but it is their
              prerogative to decide who will represent them. The people are the
              final arbiters when choosing their representatives, and I shall
              defend that right against any attempts to enforce petty, stupid
              rules for as long as I can.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In case any Members think otherwise, I am not a
              Member at Westminster. Before people jump to their feet to tell me
              that I tried often enough, I concede. I tried many times to become
              a Westminster MP, and I failed on each occasion.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Close:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall not use that term, because it reflects
              on several representatives of the Member’s party who polled
              fewer votes than I did. If my result was miserable, I shall allow
              the Member to comment on the results of his party Colleagues.
              However, he did not really mean that. He endorsed my view that, as
              a democrat, I accept the decision of the people. They decide
              either to elect me or that they do not want me as their MP, and in
              future they may decide that they do not want me as their
              councillor — next year they may decide that they do not want me
              as a Member of the Legislative Assembly. That is the people’s
              prerogative. How dare anyone try to deny the people the right to
              choose? That is an insult to the electorate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Morrice said that it was not clear what the
              public should do to elect representatives — &quot;It was not
              clear to the public&quot; is a direct quote. Was Ms Morrice
              suggesting that the electorate are stupid? Is she suggesting that
              when people enter the polling booth they do not know for whom they
              are voting? The electorate in Northern Ireland are extremely
              intelligent. Members who have canvassed will appreciate just how
              tuned-in our electorate are. It is far off the mark to suggest
              that they are lacking. Post-election, a candidate may think that
              the electorate were silly because he or she did not get elected,
              but that is the electorate’s prerogative. If the people of the
              Lagan Valley constituency and the city of Lisburn wish to have
              Séamus Close as both a councillor and a Member of the Assembly,
              so be it. That is a highly intelligent electorate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are several impediments to standing for
              election. A person under 18 cannot stand. If a person is insane,
              he or she cannot stand — though there are a few in the Chamber
              who appear to have slipped through. They shall remain nameless.
              All credit to them — they must not be as mad as they seem. There
              are others, predominantly outside the Chamber, who would say that
              all those who put themselves forward for election qualify to be
              described as insane. The third obstacle to standing is bankruptcy
              — in financial terms only; it does not refer to bankruptcy of
              thought or political content or ability. To add to that list of
              impediments the circumstance of being already elected to another
              body would be to deny the electorate the opportunity to exercise
              their intelligence and the right to make a democratic choice.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Like other Members, I want to know what
              motivated the motion. Why is it on the Order Paper now? It was not
              on the Order Paper 12 months ago. Is it just coincidence that 12
              months ago local government elections and, more importantly, a
              Westminster election took place in which one of the proposer’s
              colleagues stood as a candidate for South Belfast? That is
              particularly pertinent to the motion. Like myself, she was
              unsuccessful; although I received a few more votes than her. Has
              the motion been tabled by a johnny-come-lately party — perhaps
              it should be referred to as a Monica-come-lately or a
              Jane-come-lately party — that wishes to change the political
              process because it has failed to gain more than one mandate? I
              cannot assert that as a fact. I can only question the motives
              behind the motion.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion poses other questions. If Ms
              McWilliams had been elected last year, would the motion have been
              tabled? If so, would she resign her seat as a Member of the
              Assembly, thus denying her constituents her wisdom and her ability
              to contribute to the House and the Committees?</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.45 am</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Alternatively, would she have given the
              Westminster seat a trial run for a few months before deciding to
              resign, forcing a by-election at great cost to the electorate? If
              politicians cannot obtain two mandates, why criticise those who
              have them, especially as the electorate choose. That is petty
              politics; it is not good politics and is not in the interests of
              the people of Northern Ireland. As has already been mentioned, a
              large degree of complementarity runs through all elected
              positions. If someone comes to me with a problem, I cannot decide
              whether that person has done so in my role as a councillor or as
              an Assembly Member. There is an overlap. The representative role
              can often be fulfilled better if one has more than one elected
              responsibility.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many politicians in Northern Ireland cut their
              political teeth in 1973 — that is when they learnt the
              intricacies of the great profession that is politics, when they
              learnt how to represent people and when they learnt the basis of
              service. When I think about those bygone days, I must say that
              those of us who stood for election to the respective councils in
              that year did not think about financial rewards. There was no such
              thing as financial reward. We stood to serve the people. Are we to
              be dismissed now as &quot;double-jobbers&quot;? That is an insult
              to those who, during the 1970s, 1980s and into the 1990s, were the
              only democratic bulwarks in our society against terrorism and
              against those who wished to see democracy go down the plughole. I
              could tell the House of numerous occasions when I was under attack
              inside and outside the council chamber and in my home because I
              dared to be a democrat, and because I dared to put my head above
              the parapet in days when it was fashionable not to be bothered.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us look at some other practical
              experiences. What would have happened if the rule had been in
              vogue in 1973, and people who had been elected to our newly formed
              local authorities had been prevented from standing for the
              proposed power-sharing Executive? Where would the pool of
              necessary expertise and talent have been? What would have happened
              if the rule had been carried through to the 1975 Constitutional
              Convention, or to James Prior’s rolling devolution experiment of
              1982-86, of which I was privileged to be a member? Having been
              elected to the local authority in 1981, was I to say that I could
              not stand in 1982? As Ms Morrice said, I would have been elected
              in 1982 and forced to resign one seat. That experiment lasted a
              few years. It fell because of the Anglo-Irish Agreement — I am
              not making a political point, merely stating a fact. If that
              stupid, petty rule had been in vogue in the 1970s, what would have
              happened, and where would we have been in Northern Ireland if all
              those who had developed expertise since 1973 in the new local
              authorities were suddenly without a &quot;job&quot;? Where would
              democracy have been?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When Members table motions, they should think
              the matter through and give it some consideration. It does not do
              any of us any good to hear what I can only refer to as a
              half-baked idea that denies people democracy.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although the motion is welcome in the sense
              that it allows us to discuss the matter, it is a blunt instrument
              in its current form. As Mr Close said, one cannot be
              over-prescriptive — people have a choice. We must break the
              system down into its various components. For example, there are
              four Ministers serving as councillors. In the long term, that is
              not sustainable because conflicts of interest may arise, although
              interests are declared and such conflicts do not arise frequently.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr ONeill spoke about the concept of public
              service and said that local government is in a different category
              from the European or Westminster Parliaments. There is some
              substance in that. As Mr Close said, we must remember that, at one
              time, local government was the only fragment of democratic
              representation left at local level. It was a very watered-down
              system. As you know only too well, Mr Deputy Speaker, people kept
              that alive during very difficult times when there was no glory and
              there were no resources. It was hard work for often little or no
              reward, and local government had few powers. However, local
              government has been improving, and I hope that it will improve
              further as a result of the review of public administration.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, we should debate the issue of
              simultaneous membership of the Westminster Parliament, the
              European Parliament, the Assembly and, indeed, the Executive.
              Although I accept Mr Close’s point that people are entitled to
              their choice, there is a point where it becomes physically
              impossible to be fully effective in every role. This is a
              Europe-wide problem and is not confined to the United Kingdom.</p>

              often mayors in their districts. The President of France used to
              be the mayor of Paris. He held that position while he was also a
              member of the French National Assembly. People also hold positions
              simultaneously in the Assembly and in the Départements that are
              the units of regional administration in France. The same situation
              is found across the European community. A great deal of the work
              of the European Parliament is done in Committees as well as in the
              monthly meetings in Strasbourg, and it is not possible,
              physically, to be in Committees here, at Westminster and at the
              European Parliament, while attending plenary sessions at the same
              time. It is not physically or humanly possible.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although I fully accept that our three MEPs
              have a good record of bringing help to Northern Ireland, how much
              better might it have been if they had done that full time and
              concentrated on it exclusively? Similarly, in Westminster,
              sporadic attendance at Northern Ireland Questions when the cameras
              are there and at the odd committee, especially a Northern Ireland
              Affairs Select Committee, is fine — it is a good contribution.
              Squeezing in a few votes on a motion on which there will be many
              divisions so that MPs can maintain their voting record is all very
              well. However, that is only part of the job. There are other
              parts. Some Members here refuse to sit on Committees, and it is
              not because they are not available. Such Members do not face any
              financial consequences. Therefore, before we beat the drum too
              hard, perhaps we have to get our own House in order.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There needs to be a debate about how a person
              can realistically occupy three or four significant positions
              simultaneously and hope to do all the jobs as adequately as he
              could if he were concentrating on one of them — but that will
              take time. Mr ONeill’s point is valid, because there is more
              difference between representation at local government level and
              the Assembly than there is between representation at Parliament
              and at the European Parliament. Nevertheless, if, as I hope, local
              government returns to a more recognisable form, and the jobs
              become more substantive, then the question will arise again. I
              accept that the people in Northern Ireland are an informed
              electorate. They have a choice to make, and they know who and what
              they are voting for.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the fact that we are having this
              discussion and debate. There is an issue about Ministers holding
              more than one position, and it is something that we will have to
              address. Part of the reason for people holding more than one
              position is that the Assembly was perceived as a fledgling
              institution that had not settled, and many of us might have
              reconsidered our decision to stand for election last year had the
              circumstances been different. Moving forward to the position that
              Mr ONeill has outlined: for those who are not Ministers the local
              government role and the Assembly role can be compatible, but it is
              something we will have to look at.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The EU is moving to a point where it will not
              be possible to be a member of the European Parliament and other

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The right hon Member is correct. However, there
              is a tide of opinion among Governments in the EU that may soon
              lead to it not being possible to have dual mandates. When we have
              a situation where there are people with three or four mandates and
              jobs — which we have here — we reach the point of overdoing
              it. The hon Member for Lagan Valley, Mr Close, defends the
              electorate’s right to choose, and I accept that. I also
              understand that the situation has particular temporary exigencies.
              However, it is useful to have the debate. We will have to return
              to this subject, and in the long term the game is probably up for
              those holding three and four jobs. The position is not
              sustainable. However, local government is a different matter.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Like Séamus Close, I am bewildered at the
              reasons behind this act of political masochism by Jane Morrice.
              She appears to be happy to have set herself up in the Assembly
              with the motion. I suppose she has got the support of Esmond
              Birnie — whether that is of any comfort to her, I am not so
              sure. She has not even succeeded in getting the support of the
              members of IRA/Sinn Féin beside her, who are well known to be in
              favour of doing the double. For a long time, their members were
              required to have a night job as well as a day job, and only
              recently have they allowed conscientious objectors into the ranks
              of the public representatives of the party.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of course, this has been a useful exercise for
              Séamus Close. He has had a wonderful opportunity to electioneer
              for next May. I notice that he has told the electorate that he has
              been a representative for 30 years and has been very pleased at
              the support they have given him. He admired their generosity,
              knowledge, and wisdom. At least Jane Morrice has given Séamus
              Close a chance to get some publicity for himself.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Close is right that many people will be
              amused, amazed or bewildered by the motive behind the motion. The
              Women’s Coalition is not against double-jobbing. It is not
              against it in principle. On many occasions, I have heard Monica
              McWilliams and Jane Morrice champion the cause of the working
              woman. They ask for crèches, nurseries and facilities to free
              them from the sink and get them out to work. Therefore they are
              not against double-jobbing in principle — a woman can be a
              mother and a housewife, and she should be helped to do another job
              as well.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As we heard from several people, they are not
              against double-jobbing personally. The register of Members’
              interests makes interesting reading. Ms McWilliams, who is too
              busy to attend the debate even though her name is on the Order
              Paper, has registered an interest as an external examiner and as a
              non-practising professor, though I do not know what that means. Ms
              Morrice is on the board of Laganside. She said that that does not
              really matter because it is only for one morning a month. I got
              the attendance records, and in the past twelve months she has
              managed to get to only three out of every four meetings. She seems
              to find no difficulty in having a non-elected position as well as
              an elected position.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What is the motive behind this? Now and again,
              the Women’s Coalition comes up with some bizarre ideas. Ms
              Morrice’s most bizarre idea before this came during the debate
              on the memorial for the millennium. She proposed that every house,
              without qualification, and every tree that was over 100 years old
              — how that could be worked out, I do not know — should have a
              protection order placed on it. It did not matter what condition it
              was in, so long as it was over 100 years old. That was how we
              should remember the millennium.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was not 100 years old, and it was still
              falling down. Perhaps this was just another bizarre idea.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We also know that the Women’s Coalition is a
              party of interferers. It loves civic forums, commissioners,
              agencies and commissions. If there is a way to interfere in people’s
              lives, the Women’s Coalition will find it. If it has not yet
              been discovered, it will be. Perhaps this interfering tendency is
              behind the motion, or perhaps, as has been suggested, it is not
              about efficiency; it is all about jealousy. Members of the Women’s
              Coalition could not get elected to two positions; so, if they
              cannot have two, nobody else will.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have had a constructive debate today, but it
              is up to individuals to decide whether they want to set themselves
              up for more than one elected position. If they want to be sad, if
              they want to run from this place to that place, from this person
              to that person and from this role to that role, that is up to
              them, and the Assembly should not legislate for it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is also up to their parties to decide
              whether they do the jobs efficiently. Some people can organise
              themselves better; some find one job enough to hold. It reflects
              on the party if people get elected and then do not do the job
              well. The electorate will decide that they do not wish to have
              that person about the place. The people know whether someone holds
              more than one elected position. Let them decide if that is the
              kind of person that they want to represent them.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us not accept such an &quot;interfering
              busybody’s&quot; attitude from a party that has no Member with a
              double mandate. Despite Ms Morrice’s comments, Members are not
              hoarding elected positions, and parties with Members who have a
              double mandate do not lack suitably qualified candidates. Was the
              Women’s Coalition so bereft of suitably qualified candidates in
              South Belfast that it had to put forward Monica McWilliams? Could
              another Women’s Coalition member not run for election? Ms
              McWilliams was fielded because the party believed that her profile
              as an Assembly Member gave her a better chance of winning a
              Westminster seat. They were wrong. Ms Morrice should not come here
              with sour grapes, because she got it wrong.</p>

              have had a valuable start to an important debate; it is only the
              beginning.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Dr Birnie for his support and
              clarification of the issue. Sir Reg Empey said that Ministers who
              are councillors could have a conflict of interests and that
              eventually it would become physically impossible for them to
              remain fully effective as representatives. That vital point
              supported my comments about the difficulty of juggling the
              responsibilities of elected positions, which can involve air
              travel and accommodation difficulties.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr ONeill agreed that MLAs should not be MPs or
              MEPs. He made the vital point that mandates represent authority
              and must be recognised. In addition, I thank him for his point
              about timing. Mr ONeill and Mr Close stated that local councillors
              provide an important public service. I do not wish to detract from
              the hugely important service that is provided at local council
              level. Patricia Wallace is the Women’s Coalition’s councillor
              in North Down, and we appreciate the work that her position
              involves. I congratulate Mr Close and others who have served their
              communities so well for so long; however, times have changed.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If MLAs relinquished their council positions,
              by-elections might be called, even if the major parties agreed. I
              am sympathetic to Ms Morrice’s argument, but does she not agree
              that, to facilitate the relinquishment of council positions by
              MLAs, we need a mechanism whereby vacancies are filled through
              automatic co-options rather than by-elections?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Morrice:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is a valid point. I commend the former
              SDLP leader John Hume for relinquishing his seat in the Assembly
              because he recognised the heavy burden of the role. He passed his
              mandate to Annie Courtney, enabling her to participate also. The
              appropriateness of a similar system at local government level to
              allow for co-option is an important point for debate.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will not give way. I have only 10 minutes in
              which to cover all the points.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker, I will deal soon with Mr
              Weir’s comments that the motion is anti-democratic, hypocritical
              and wrongly directed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several Members made the point that Monica
              McWilliams stood in South Belfast in the Westminster elections.
              Some of the comments were quite absurd. There is no question that
              members of one body must be allowed to stand for election to
              another. However, if elected, they should give up any other
              positions they hold at the earliest opportunity. That is our
              policy, and it is not hypocritical. Elected representatives should
              not even contemplate taking up several posts at the same time.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The point was made that co-options and
              alternates are a valuable way of bringing new people in. Several
              Members mentioned that things were different in the past. I
              acknowledge that. However, as far as the Northern Ireland Assembly
              and the new dispensation are concerned, times have changed. We
              desperately need new blood, new thinking and young and different
              voices. That is why debates such as this are so valuable.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Sinn Féin for its position on the
              issue. Fair enough, it is not yet at the stage of fully supporting
              the motion, but it supports the concept that one elected position
              is the preferred option. Sinn Féin is at least moving in the
              right direction. I also recognise the point that Mary Nelis made
              about the importance of stability.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Weir said that the motion is
              anti-democratic. We must consider who chooses election candidates.
              I was interested to hear Mr Close’s remark that he chose to go
              forward and the electorate voted for him. I was not aware that
              that is how parties operate. I thought that party members put
              themselves forward for nomination as a candidate and that the
              party then selects the candidates. Is that not the case? It is not
              common practice for the Ulster Unionist Party to select a
              candidate who already holds another position. Such practice is a
              nod in the direction of the motion.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Parties choose their candidates. Surely parties
              should be encouraging new, young blood to join their ranks. I am
              not trying to interfere, but there is recognition in the European
              Parliament, the Scottish Parliament, the National Assembly for
              Wales and in parties here — the SDLP and Sinn Féin have nodded
              in this direction — that it is a physical impossibility to carry
              out the work of three elected representatives at the same time.
              Three people should be doing that work.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If one person can do three jobs, why not
              consider the antithesis of that and have two people job-sharing an
              elected position? Is that not a novel approach, not unlike our
              millennium preservation fund mentioned by Mr Sammy Wilson, which
              could have perhaps saved Séamus Heaney’s house?</p>

              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That this Assembly expresses its concern at the
              increasing levels of crime and falling crime detection rates in
              Northern Ireland and condemns the public stance adopted by Sinn
              Féin to the police in Northern Ireland.</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Policing in Northern Ireland is causing grave
              concern. Political interference in policing — due to the Patten
              proposals, which stem from the Belfast Agreement, and the damage
              that those proposals have done to the numerical strength and
              morale of the Police Service — has contributed directly to an
              escalation of crime on the streets of Northern Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Public representatives receive communications
              on a weekly basis from people expressing their concerns about
              letting their youngsters go out at the weekend because of the
              number of attacks on people at places of entertainment. Parts of
              Belfast and other towns have become notorious for the number of
              attacks on young people in particular. Parents who thought that
              the alleged ending of terrorist campaigns made it safe to send
              their youngsters out without their being blown up are now afraid
              to send them out in case they get beaten up.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People are concerned about the effects of
              increasing lawlessness on their property — car theft is rampant,
              and there is damage to cars and burglary. According to the police,
              the number of reported incidents of crime in the last year rose by
              11·6%. As a result of the decimation, demoralisation and
              curtailment of the Police Service, detection rates have gone down
              from 27·5% to 18·8%. The detection rate for car theft and damage
              to cars has fallen to half of what it was a year ago. That means
              that of the 16,000 incidents of car theft and damage to vehicles
              occurring each year, only a small proportion of the people
              responsible are being identified.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That has undermined confidence in the Police
              Service in Northern Ireland. It has caused increasing frustration
              among people who do not have a political agenda. They want to bash
              the police not because they are anti-police, or because they
              consider the police to have changed as a result of the Belfast
              Agreement. They are unhappy about policing because they believe
              that the level of service that they are entitled to as citizens
              has been affected. Their property and their families are being
              affected by the rising crime rate. The police appear to be
              powerless in the face of that crime rate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am sure that other Members will say that that
              is the case. That is true whether people come from Nationalist or
              Unionist backgrounds or from working-class or middle-class
              backgrounds. It does not matter what race they are. People want to
              live in safety and have their property protected, but that is not
              happening.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is general concern, which I am sure will
              be expressed today. I do not wish to harp on, but this point must
              be forcefully made. Unfortunately, the Police Service of Northern
              Ireland is less effective because people voted for political
              interference in its running. They voted for political correctness
              instead of police effectiveness. The effects of that can be seen
              on the ground.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We were told that those sacrifices, hard
              choices and difficult decisions — words that I have heard from
              members of the Ulster Unionist Party — were made because
              policing had to be accepted. We were told that were the Police
              Service accepted, it would become more effective. Immense
              sacrifices were made. People who had given years of service to the
              community in the most difficult circumstances were hurt, damaged
              and, indeed, besmirched by some of the Patten recommendations that
              were later accepted in the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What has the effect been? Have all those
              changes led to an acceptable police force? I do not wish to bore
              the Assembly with all the comments that have been made, but there
              are sheaves of statements from IRA/Sinn Féin that use exactly the
              same language about the &quot;Pattenised&quot; Police Service as
              they used about the RUC. The police are still called human rights
              abusers. They are still called a police force within a police
              force. They are still unacceptable. Sinn Féin representatives
              still publicly say that they wish the members of the Police
              Service to be treated in the same way that members of the RUC were
              treated. There has been no change. Opposing proper policing
              supports criminality.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us make no mistake. IRA/Sinn Féin cannot
              condemn the police in the terms that it has expressed and yet
              wring its hands in lament at the criminality that has descended
              upon its community. Opposing the Police Service means that
              criminality is supported. Of course, we can understand that people
              who were and who are criminals will hardly support those who are
              meant to deal with criminals. Despite sacrifices having been made,
              and the subsequent effect on the ground, there has not been the
              acceptance that we were promised — far from it. In fact, even
              more changes are demanded.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the proposed amendments to this motion
              calls on those who support criminals to get on board with the
              Police Service. I do not wish to turn this debate into a call for
              Sinn Féin to get on board policing in Northern Ireland. The
              inherent criminal tendencies in that section of the body politic
              should have no part in policing. Although the poison of Sinn Féin
              may have affected this institution, I am glad that the Policing
              Board can get on with its work because that poison has not been
              injected into its veins.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Government are going to make the mistake of
              making further concessions to those who continue to churn out
              their hatred of the police. What further concessions can be made
              to involve them in policing? Should terrorists be involved, just
              to bring Sinn Féin on board? That would be wrong for several
              reasons. My party joined the Policing Board, albeit with
              reservations because of the probable effect of Patten’s
              weakening of the police. The SDLP joined on terms which were
              acceptable at the time. To change those terms to facilitate the
              intransigent supporters of criminals would be a travesty and a
              betrayal of those who joined on the original terms.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For the Government to pander any further to
              IRA/ Sinn Féin would be a grave mistake. First, it would
              undermine those who have joined the Policing Board. Secondly, more
              concessions will only weaken the police and have a grave effect on
              their morale, which is already at rock bottom.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This motion is timely, because of the concern
              at the reduction in the Police Service’s effectiveness as a
              result of the Patten reforms and the subsequent Police (Northern
              Ireland) Act 2000. As the Government head towards a review of
              policing and the 2000 Act, the Assembly must issue a warning. I
              hope that the voices of the SDLP Members will be raised in public,
              as they have been in private, to warn the Government that
              concessions have weakened a vital service in society and that no
              more can be made.</p>

              political assumptions and observations. I share many of his
              concerns about the levels of some crimes, particularly those which
              have, unfortunately, been highlighted again. The elderly are
              vulnerable members of the community who continue to fall prey to
              criminals. Many of them have been brutally attacked in their
              homes, yet no one has been arrested, tried or convicted for those
              crimes.</p>

              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The problem with policing here is not the fault
              of Sinn Féin. I remind Members that Sinn Féin was involved in
              the negotiations for the Good Friday Agreement, which included a
              section on policing. Those involved in the negotiations and those
              who signed up to the new beginning for policing acknowledged that
              there was a fundamental problem with policing in the Six Counties.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion condemns the public stance of Sinn
              Féin. Sinn Féin’s position and public stance is clear. It
              believes that Peter Mandelson’s Police (Northern Ireland) Act
              2000 usurped the new beginning that was promised in the Good
              Friday Agreement. However, critically, Sinn Féin will continue to
              press the British Government to undo the damage of the 2000 Act
              and to fully legislate to provide for an effective and accountable
              police service.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion is bogus. It aims to make Sinn Féin
              the scapegoat for the absence of an effective police service. It
              is unclear whether the proposer blames Sinn Féin or the Ulster
              Unionist Party — perhaps he is trying to get at both. Sinn Féin,
              therefore, will not support the motion.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sinn Féin will not support the second proposed
              amendment, because it too is also fundamentally flawed. The 2000
              Act has undermined our ability to create an effective and
              accountable police service, although that aspiration was endorsed
              by the electorate last year when the SDLP and Sinn Féin published
              an analysis of policing that had a significant bearing on the
              outcome of the election. Sinn Féin was returned as the largest
              Nationalist party, showing that its overall position, including
              its views on policing, was endorsed by the electorate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As is the SDLP’s right, its proposed
              amendment asks all parties to endorse its party position. However,
              as the SDLP did not join the Policing Board until after the
              elections last year, it appears that it did not have the courage
              to inform the electorate of its position then, which would suggest
              a lack of confidence in the Nationalist community’s support for
              the policing arrangements set out in the 2000 Act.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sinn Féin’s amendment, standing in my name
              and that of John Kelly, is designed to bring the debate back to
              the core issue, namely the fulfilment of the demands of the Good
              Friday Agreement. I pledge to all communities that Sinn Féin will
              tirelessly work to establish the police service that it negotiated
              for in the Good Friday Agreement. Sammy Wilson may not be pleased
              to hear this, but I look forward to the successful outcome of
              those negotiations, because it will enable Sinn Féin to
              participate in the establishment of the service that it endorsed
              on Good Friday 1998 but has since been denied. I look forward to
              Sinn Féin’s role in overseeing the new police service.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Regrettably, my community is all too aware of
              criminal activity. Tomorrow in west Belfast we will lay to rest
              Kieran Conlon, another victim of so-called car crime. The
              long-term legacy of bad policing in my constituency contributed to
              his death, and I extend my sympathy to Mr Conlon’s family. I
              assure them that his death is not a party political issue in the
              Chamber today. Proper policing structures are an imperative of the
              Good Friday Agreement, to which all parties signed up.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sinn Féin’s view, and the view of many
              others, is that we have not yet reached the new beginning, but
              Sinn Féin will continue to strive to do so. I assure all those
              who have been recently bereaved, hurt by plastic bullets or denied
              justice, that Sinn Féin will work to establish a new, effective
              and impartial police service that all in the community can embrace
              and find beneficial.</p>

              People who assume the responsibility for making such an
              appointment must be acknowledged and applauded. They are at least
              trying to sign up to the Good Friday Agreement and the changes
              suggested in the Patten Report, even if some of them do not like
              those recommendations and may indeed deny them. Others are not

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I should like to respond to some of Sammy
              Wilson’s points. The SDLP accepts that not everything in
              policing is right; only a fool would claim otherwise. However, it
              is improper and unfair to say that many things are wrong; and it
              is particularly unfair and wrong to blame everything on the Patten
              Report. Our policing and political problems pre-date the Patten
              Commission and are not a consequence of its report. The
              Nationalist community was unable to support the RUC and to join it
              in representative numbers, and too often that force failed to
              account legally and publicly for its actions. That failure, and
              the RUC’s wider associations, caused division and dispute in our
              society over policing — and all of that pre-dates the Patten
              Report. To blame Chris Patten and the other commissioners for what
              is now wrong in policing ignores all our history, all the evidence
              and many of the facts.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although it is arguable that those factors
              pre-dated the Patten Commission, that body was supposed to cure
              them. In fact, the factors have been exacerbated since the Patten
              Report, and that is why this debate was proposed.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Attwood:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I acknowledge that argument, and, as I said,
              there are still difficulties in policing. It will take a long
              process and much heavy lifting to get it right.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the present policing system is being
              assessed, then why not acknowledge that there have been several
              recruitment exercises and that 50% of those joining the Police
              Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) now come from a Catholic
              background. The latest evidence suggests that people from that
              background come from every constituency in the North and from all
              types of Catholic backgrounds. That was not the case when the old
              RUC existed, but is true in the days of the PSNI.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If people are saying that there are still
              problems with policing, they should also acknowledge that a recent
              household survey confirmed that 75% of the Protestant community
              have confidence in the work of the Police Ombudsman, who is an
              essential partner in the new beginning for policing. Eighty-one
              per cent of the Catholic community have confidence in her work. So
              much for those who say that the Police Ombudsman is a toothless
              tiger. In her statement on the Omagh bombing, whether we like it
              or not, Nuala O’Loan demonstrated her real teeth, her real power
              and her real ability to affect policing change in the North.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If Bob McCartney is right to say that policing
              is worse than when the RUC existed, why does the Nationalist
              community test policing in some places; why does it support it in
              others; and why does it join the PSNI in yet others? Why do we not
              acknowledge all that is changing and all that is positive, rather
              than saying that policing is worse now than in the past? That is
              Sinn Féin’s argument, because even if the glass were full, it
              would claim that it was half-empty. Those who believe in the new
              beginning for policing, or who at least participate in it, should
              not indulge Sinn Fein’s attitude that regardless of what is
              right, some things will always be wrong.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sammy Wilson said that crime figures show that
              there is more crime and less detection. I do not deny that rates
              of crime and detection must be addressed. However, as Sammy Wilson
              and other Policing Board members know, the acting Chief Constable
              said on the record that the new system for recording crime had
              affected the results so that more crime was recorded, inevitably
              creating a higher recorded rate. Crime facts and figures must be
              discussed frankly and fully; we should not be selective.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sammy Wilson said that the new crime figures
              are a result of the decimation and demoralisation of the police.
              Even if there are occasional and short-term losses, there will be
              many longer-term gains. When we have a representative,
              accountable, civilian Police Service that conforms to human rights
              standards, we will have made a breakthrough in the community’s
              culture and processes so that everyone will have confidence in the
              police.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Alex Maskey asserted that we should not make
              policing a party political issue. He will know what I am about to
              say, because I have said it before: who made policing a party
              political issue by referring to Policing Board members as
              &quot;collaborators&quot;? Sinn Féin in Derry City Council
              referred to SDLP members and supporters of the Police Service as
              &quot;collaborators&quot;. Is that not party politics? Who
              referred to all the Policing Board members as &quot;dummies&quot;?
              Martin McGuinness. Is that not party politics? Who said that no
              Nationalist or Republican would join or support the Police
              Service? Who had the high-handedness and arrogance to make those
              claims? Was that not party politics from Gerry &quot;there but for
              the grace of God go I&quot; Adams? Such remarks show who is
              playing party politics and preying on people’s worst fears.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Party politics are embedded in every policing
              document that the SDLP has ever produced. For example, at the
              Brehon Law Society conference a few years ago in the United
              States, the party’s then deputy leader said that the RUC was
              upholding the law of the jungle in Northern Ireland, implying that
              the RUC perpetrates terrorism, rather than protects citizens from
              it. If that is not a disgusting politicisation of policing, I am
              open to persuasion.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Attwood:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recently, the SDLP has been getting every
              aspect of policing policy and practice right — that is the most
              compelling argument for its amendment. If the SDLP had not been on
              the Policing Board, Ronnie Flanagan would still be the Chief
              Constable, and Nuala O’Loan’s report on Omagh would have been
              &quot;decimated&quot;, to borrow a word.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Policing power would not have been turned on
              its head, as it was in the board’s response to Omagh, if the
              SDLP had not been on the Policing Board. There would not have been
              a code of ethics, which the human rights community has
              acknowledged as being positive and progressive, if the SDLP had
              not been on the Policing Board. There would not be a
              multidimensional strategy to put into practice Patten’s
              imperative to integrate Special Branch into the wider Police
              Service if the SDLP had not been on the Policing Board.</p>
              <i>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Through the scientific research programme
              commissioned by Patten, plastic bullets may be banned. Sinn Féin
              has stated that that threshold is acceptable, and that if it were
              implemented in full, it would join the Policing Board. This gives
              an opportunity to introduce other methods of riot control that
              conform with human rights standards, are consistent with minimum
              force requirements and rightly protect the police and the public
              from the riots that are so often seen on the streets of Belfast
              and elsewhere. I commend this amendment to the House.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir John Gorman:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Members will know, I am a former member of
              the Royal Ulster Constabulary, as was my father before me. My
              youngest son is a reserve constable. It is appropriate that I
              should say something on the motion, and I hope that what I say
              will be of some value.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Contrary to some fears, the level of recorded
              crime is fairly static, and the year-on-year increase over the
              past 12 months is almost nil. When I was chief executive of the
              Housing Executive I was conscious of the fraudulent use of tax
              certificates. Therefore I was heartened to read last week that the
              PSNI team, which has spent many months investigating this issue,
              has now traced over 100 people who are involved in this deplorable
              crime in Northern Ireland. These people extracted more than £10
              million from taxpayers. However, the case is sub judice, so I will
              say no more about it, but I am certain that there will be
              prosecutions.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">More than 70% of crime in the Province is drugs
              related. The use of drugs has an enormous impact on young people.
              However, the number of violent crimes, while recently on the
              decrease, is shocking compared with the levels we suffered when I
              was in the RUC. Leaving aside terrorist killings, murder is now
              almost a weekly occurrence in Northern Ireland. Thirty years ago
              it was so rare that the names of the victims were imprinted on the
              public mind.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Undoubtedly, the fear of crime is great, but it
              is disproportionate to the real risk. Public concern is focused on
              the PSNI’s woeful 27% clearance rate. I note the point that has
              just been made from the SDLP Benches, but the rate is still very
              low. The clearance rates for burglary, criminal damage and robbery
              are especially worrying at less than 15%. The number of
              investigations into terrorist killings that lead to prosecution is
              also extremely low, although, as much as anything else, that
              probably reflects failures in our criminal justice system, gaps in
              the legislation and communities’ fears of reporting
              paramilitaries.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I can support the motion. It is succinct and
              lays the blame where it should be laid. Sinn Féin’s attitude to
              the PSNI is as deplorable as its attitude to the Omagh
              investigation and nearly as bad as its mealy-mouthed attitude to
              the gardaí. I am glad that nearly 95% of voters in the Republic
              saw through Sinn Féin’s attitude to the gardaí.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sinn Féin deliberately adopts an &quot;impossibilist&quot;
              position. Its vision of a police force or police service bears no
              relation to any police force in the world. It seems to think that
              policing should be a branch of the Department of Health and Social
              Services. However, anyone with any experience knows that a police
              force is a necessary evil that must strike a balance between
              coercion and accountability. Sinn Féin forgot to add certain
              words to its amendment; I point that out as an important factor in
              the decision that it may make. It should have added six important
              words: &quot;Get rid of the Special Branch&quot;.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In principle, there is nothing wrong with the
              SDLP’s amendment. We should all be able to support the vision of
              a police service contained in the Belfast Agreement. Those of us
              on this side of the House, especially perhaps, believe that the
              RUC was, and is, a fine force and one that did its best to fulfil
              the aims of the agreement in extremely difficult circumstances.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The problem with the SDLP’s amendment is that
              it seeks to commit a deliberate evasion. It fails to name the
              guilty party in the Chamber. That is why the Ulster Unionist
              Party, while sharing the SDLP’s vision of a first-class police
              force, will abstain on the SDLP’s amendment. I see no reason why
              the SDLP cannot support the motion today, and I look forward to
              hearing some further explanation as to why it will not.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion. The decent law-abiding
              people of Northern Ireland have had to endure a huge increase in
              crime as a direct consequence of the Belfast Agreement. This is
              hardly surprising, given that the Belfast Agreement is a
              corruption of democracy and the rule of law.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Belfast Agreement has destroyed the Royal
              Ulster Constabulary and reduced policing resources significantly.
              At the same time, illegal terrorist organisations have been able
              to strengthen their structures and carry out their criminal
              activities due to the early release of hundreds of their members,
              many of whom committed the most heinous crimes.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thirty-one terrorists freed under the Belfast
              Agreement have been returned to prison for their criminal
              activity. One such individual who had been released early and has
              since been returned to prison is a double murderer who was
              recently convicted of a sex attack in Belfast.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Released prisoners have been seen on the
              streets of Belfast during recent rioting. One such individual
              observed by members of the security forces at recent riots in
              Ardoyne is the Republican Sean Kelly, who murdered nine innocent
              Protestants on the Shankill Road. That is clearly a breach of his
              early release licence. The majority of the 31 prisoners who have
              been returned to jail have been accused of criminal offences such
              as theft and assault.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is nauseating to hear IRA/Sinn Féin express
              concerns about human rights. No group continues to abuse human
              rights more than IRA/Sinn Féin. IRA/Sinn Féin have murdered over
              300 police officers and injured many thousands more during the
              past 30 years. Everyone, except the naive and gullible, knows that
              IRA/Sinn Féin are not committed to the principles of exclusively
              peaceful and democratic means.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Provisional IRA, which is inextricably
              linked to Sinn Féin, continues to be fully armed and has enough
              explosives and ammunition to murder everyone in Northern Ireland.
              There has been no decommissioning of illegal weapons and no
              disbandment of the Provisional IRA. All we have are meaningless
              statements. In fact, there is clear evidence that the IRA is
              heavily involved in gunrunning.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Provisional IRA continues to murder, bomb,
              gather intelligence, deal in illegal drugs and carry out beatings
              and shootings, including attacks on children. The IRA is heavily
              involved in the abuse of social security payments, illegal
              livestock trade, evasion of tax and VAT, tobacco and alcohol
              smuggling and duty evasion, illegal fuel, insurance and
              compensation fraud, money laundering, cheque and credit card
              fraud, electoral fraud, motor vehicle licensing fraud, extortion,
              counterfeit goods, vehicle theft, armed robbery, hijacking and
              many other criminal activities.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What are the human rights of the innocent
              victims of such crimes? Have the Government cracked down hard on
              illegal organisations? Not at all: the opposite has happened. A
              self-confessed leader of the Provisional IRA, Martin McGuinness,
              boasts of his criminal activity, yet, disgustingly, he was made
              Minister of Education by the pro-agreement Members. What sort of
              example is that to young people? Is it any wonder that many young
              people turn to crime when they see the likes of Martin McGuinness
              in the Government of Northern Ireland?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is little wonder that Sinn Féin is opposed
              to the rule of law when the Provisional IRA has such a huge
              criminal empire. The IRA murders Catholics who join the police —
              what about their human rights?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is regrettable that there has been a huge
              increase in crime in Unionist areas as policing resources have
              been decimated by the implementation of the Patten report. We have
              lost hundreds of experienced professional and long-serving
              officers as a result of political expediency, and their expertise
              is gone forever.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At 11pm a week ago last Saturday, I contacted
              Newtownabbey police station on behalf of a constituent.
              Newtownabbey has a major police station serving a population of
              approximately 81,000. However, no one above the rank of constable
              was in the station. Neighbourhood beat officers have been moved to
              other duties and no longer walk the beat.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The reduction of policing resources throughout
              Northern Ireland has resulted in a large increase in crime and a
              lack of resources for bringing the guilty to justice. There is a
              daily catalogue of crime, including armed robberies, burglaries,
              assaults, attacks on the elderly, vandalism and anti-social
              behaviour.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A few months ago in my street in Newtownabbey,
              an elderly lady was robbed on her way to church on Sunday morning.
              Throughout Northern Ireland pensioners are being robbed in their
              homes. The brutal murder of Joshua McClenaghan in south Antrim in
              March this year is a graphic illustration of the depravity of the
              people carrying out these crimes.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Businesses and retail outlets are robbed
              regularly, leaving staff, including young people, traumatised for
              a long time. Then many shop owners have to endure intimidation,
              threats, assaults and demands for payment of so-called protection
              money from Republican and so-called Loyalist paramilitary
              organisations. Decent law-abiding people are fed up with such
              illegal activity.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Newtownabbey alone, Translink has suffered
              damages of £100,000 as a result of attacks on its vehicles in the
              past 12 months. Every weekend, new bus shelters are smashed in a
              litany of vandalism. Seven bus shelters were smashed in close
              proximity in one night.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Government’s response to the crime wave
              is to consider the closure of around 17 police stations and the
              removal of a permanent policing presence from many areas. Members
              are irresponsible when they tell people not to provide information
              to the police about the Omagh bomb and other crimes.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Illegal terrorist organisations set themselves
              up as judge, jury and executioner. They have murdered drug dealers
              and other criminals — some within their own organisations —
              but the Government bury their head in the sand and describe such
              activity as &quot;housekeeping&quot;.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The courts must also get tough with criminals.
              The punishment should fit the crime and be a deterrent to others.
              I publicly condemn the comments of the vice-chairman of the
              Policing Board, Denis Bradley, for stating that ex-terrorists
              should be allowed to join the police. That is a corruption of
              democracy and the rule of law. Equally corrupt is the prospect of
              IRA/Sinn Féin taking seats on the Policing Board and controlling
              the forces of law and order.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The &quot;Defend the RUC&quot; pledge and
              declaration states:</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;We repudiate a structure for policing
              that offers a role to the representatives of paramilitary
              organisations.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Regrettably, such structures exist, and the
              ultimate corruption of the integrity of the rule of law will occur
              when IRA/Sinn Féin takes up positions in such structures in the
              near future after it gains more concessions from a weak
              Government.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCartney:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have high personal regard for Sir John Gorman
              and the service that he, as a former member of the RUC, and his
              family have rendered to the community. However, his assertion that
              crime is static does not hold up. The figures contained in the
              Chief Constable’s report to the board, which was made available
              at the beginning of the month, clearly demonstrate that that is
              not the case. As Sammy Wilson pointed out, the overall detection
              rate when compared with last year dropped from 27·5% to 18·8%.
              The rate has decreased substantially in all but one area, in which
              there was a marginal improvement of 0·2%.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no doubt that police in any
              jurisdiction need two things to sustain their success: first, they
              must have adequate resources and numbers; secondly, they must have
              good morale and must believe that their service is worthwhile and
              that they have the respect of the people on whose behalf they put
              their health, lives and bodies at risk. In both respects, the RUC
              suffered because of the Patten Commission. Now, as the Police
              Service of Northern Ireland, its numbers have been significantly
              reduced and the morale of those who serve in it has been seriously
              damaged.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For example, within the past six months, I had
              a meeting with the senior officer for the north Down area.
              Notionally, he should have between 280 and 290 constables to cover
              the area. Of that number, 40 took redundancy under the Patten
              Report and have not been replaced and 55 are on special static
              duty and look after notables and those who, despite the ceasefire,
              apparently require 24-hour guard. A further 60 are on long-term
              sick leave — that is they have been sick for more than 12
              months. That figure does not include those who have taken
              significant sick leave within that period. The figures total 155,
              which means that under 50% of the allotted staff are available for
              police duties.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A consequence of that is that Holywood, a quiet
              town with good community relations, has been turned into Tombstone
              or Abilene. There have been three bank robberies. During a robbery
              of the Ulster Bank in Church Road, the getaway car was blocked in
              by a car that had been double-parked. One can walk comfortably
              from the police station to the site of the robbery in less than
              five minutes, but it took the police so long to arrive that the
              robbers managed to extricate themselves and the getaway car and
              make good their escape. That is only one example of under-policing
              as a result of Patten.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have heard much factual detail about the
              difficulties and hardships suffered by people as a result of the
              rising tide of criminality. I want to address some of the
              fundamental principles behind that tide. Fergus Finlay — a
              one-time special political adviser to Dick Spring; no longer of
              pious and immortal memory in the political scene — said at the
              time of the negotiations that without Sinn Féin any agreement
              would not be worth a penny candle. The day after the joint Downing
              Street declaration was issued, in an address to the nation, John
              Major said that the only people who could give peace were the
              armed men of violence.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The result of that for the British Government,
              as far as the Belfast Agreement was concerned, was not a political
              settlement, but conflict resolution between the British state and
              armed and violent Republicanism. The price that the British
              Government paid was political and policing institutions that were
              essentially transitional in nature. Sinn Féin was promised that
              it would be given what it wanted as long as it did not bomb the
              mainland and ceased its activities so that the business and
              commercial communities could be bribed with the prospect of
              enriching themselves.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The result is that since 1998 Nationalist and
              Loyalist communities in public housing areas, whether Poleglass or
              Ballybeen or Kilcooley, have been subjected to the rule of
              terrorists, paramilitaries and criminals who are responsible for a
              great percentage of rising crime.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Madam Deputy Speaker [Ms Morrice] in the
              Chair)</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some months ago there was a debate in this
              Chamber that was not about policing: it was about the
              implementation of agreements said to have been reached at Weston
              Park. Mark Durkan, the Deputy First Minister, told the House that
              two senior officials in the British negotiating party told him
              that the reason that his proposals were not being implemented and
              that Sinn Féin’s might be was because he had no guns. The issue
              of policing is directly connected to the possession of arms and
              the arsenal of terror.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The two main objectives of a paramilitary
              terrorist organisation such as Sinn Féin/IRA have been, first, to
              keep possession of the means of terrorising those whom it wishes
              to bend to its objectives and, secondly, the destruction of any
              force that might be an effective counter-terrorist organisation.
              Those are the twin aims of Sinn Féin/IRA. It wishes to retain the
              arsenal with which to threaten British Administrations so that
              they will meet its demands and to destroy whatever police force
              there is.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those who take time to read the opening
              paragraphs of the Patten Report will find that, curiously, Mr
              Patten confirmed that the broad acceptance rates of the RUC were
              higher throughout the entire community than those of any
              continental police force. That is amazing when one recalls that
              that force, which had 301 dead, 8,000 seriously injured and a
              multitude of others scarred mentally and physically, was awarded
              the George Cross. That was rather like being awarded the Victoria
              Cross on the first day of the battle of the Somme and then being
              shot on the sixth day for cowardice. That is what happened. The
              George Cross was the pay-off for destroying the record and service
              of a proud force.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All of that might have been remotely justified
              if what had been put in its place was a more effective, efficient
              and acceptable police force that was reducing crime. Although one
              could argue that many of the factors giving rise to crime
              pre-dated Patten, as I said in my question to Mr Attwood, Patten
              was supposed to be the great cure-all.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Patten was supposed to be the herald of the
              reforms that would see an effective, acceptable police force that
              would be capable of reducing crime. Instead, we have a police
              force that is undermanned, undernourished, with a much reduced
              morale, faced with a rising tide of crime not a falling tide. What
              does the SDLP offer? It offers the old principle of &quot;live,
              horse, and you will get grass&quot;. It says that some time in the
              future all those marvellous promises and reforms will result in
              fewer elderly pensioners being beaten up in their homes, fewer
              young people being killed by joyriders on the roads, fewer violent
              robberies, fewer murders and fewer sex crimes. We shall see —
              but it is quite plain that that is not the case.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For many years, the SDLP refused to endorse the
              RUC despite the losses that the police were suffering, despite the
              RUC’s record in bringing to justice a far higher percentage of
              so-called Loyalist terrorists and criminals than Republican, and
              despite the fact that some of its members had also suffered death
              and injury at the hands of the Loyalist organisations.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All crime is not attributable to Sinn Féin or
              Republicans. A very significant amount of crime is attributable to
              the activities of Loyalist paramilitaries, some of whom are
              represented or fronted in this House by the PUP. We could talk
              about the PUP/UVF in the same way that we talk about Sinn Féin/IRA.
              The terminology would be equally appropriate, but the principles
              for which I contend, and which I hope the motion will inspire, are
              equally applicable to both. The only reason that there is emphasis
              on Sinn Féin is that it has far greater political representation;
              it has far greater political clout, and it has been promised a
              great deal. It is right that we should send a message from the
              Assembly that Sinn Féin is not only not welcome here while it is
              inextricably linked to armed terrorists, but that it has no place
              in a democracy in participation either on the Policing Board or on
              the local police boards.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I believe in redemption. I believe that those
              who give up their criminal activity, who dissociate themselves
              entirely from terror, who evidence it by their works as well as
              their words, should be accepted into the company of democrats. I
              have no truck with Members of Sinn Féin in this House or with
              Loyalist paramilitaries, but the day that they give firm evidence
              that they are no longer committed, in any way, to criminality and
              terror, I shall welcome them — even though I am opposed, in
              principle, to this form of devolution. However, until then, they
              must be treated like the pariahs they are. I encourage all Members
              to support the motion.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Paisley Jnr:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I open my comments by touching on the two
              amendments. The Sinn Féin amendment is unsurprising in its
              &quot;Gerry in Wonderland&quot; predictability. It is a Republican
              wish list of what they want for policing, but it does not even
              call on people to support the police. If Members read it
              carefully, there is no call to support, or join, the police.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This comes from a party that is in Government,
              which is absolutely ridiculous, and yet will not put its name to a
              motion that calls for support for the police. If we think for one
              moment of the import of that decision, people will realise the
              terrible state of affairs that we have come to in this country.
              There is no such thing as neutrality on the issue of law and
              order. There is no neutral gear, because if you do not support the
              police, you support crime and those who are engaged in it.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.00 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We see the supporters of crime and their
              activity daily. For the past four months, business in my Colleague
              Mr Campbell’s council chamber in Londonderry has consistently
              been disrupted by Provisional IRA/Sinn Féin activists. They
              prevent council business from taking place because they are
              opposed to policing in Northern Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second proposed amendment — the SDLP
              amendment — is slightly better in that it calls on parties to
              participate in policing, and that is a welcome change from
              previous SDLP policy. It has been stated, during this debate and
              previously, that we welcome the fact that the SDLP has come to a
              position of political maturity where it does support the police,
              and it should be congratulated for that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, I have to comment on some of the
              points that Alex Attwood, the Member for West Belfast, made in his
              criticisms of Sinn Féin. He said that the geographical
              distribution of people joining the police dismisses the Sinn Féin
              argument. I wish that the Nationalist community were more
              supportive of the police than Mr Attwood hopes they are. The
              recruitment figures in Newry, Armagh and west Belfast are not as
              hopeful as they might have been. Alex Attwood and his Colleagues
              must show leadership in those areas to encourage people to support
              the police. Mr Attwood referred to Nuala O’Loan’s report. The
              Policing Board did not support that report; it set it aside, and
              he should be honest about that. If he wants to admit that he let
              her down, so be it, but he set the report aside. In those
              circumstances he ought to be careful when he addresses the issue
              of policing.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The two proposed amendments avoid the issue,
              and Sir John Gorman put his finger on it when addressing that
              matter. I am disappointed by the SDLP’s woolliness and by its
              failure to focus on placing the blame. I am also disappointed
              that, together, the two amendments are peddling a sectarian line
              that is poorly conceived in human rights jargon. It is about an
              anti-police line — anti-Special Branch and
              anti-Protestant-members-of-the-Police-Service, if they had the
              guts to say so — and it comes from parties that have been on
              record as referring to the police as &quot;pigs&quot; outside
              Policing Board meetings. That is the anti-police stance taken by
              certain Members. If they could get away with it, they would say it
              in the amendments to my Colleague Mr Sammy Wilson’s motion.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In supporting the motion, I draw the House’s
              attention to three incontrovertible facts. First, there is
              increasing crime. Of that there is no doubt. Statistics for
              2001-02 show that there were 123,269 crimes in Northern Ireland,
              and in the previous year there were 110,421. That is a substantial
              increase that we cannot get away from. In his most recent report,
              in May 2002, the acting Chief Constable said that the recorded
              crime figures for the period would undoubtedly be revised upwards.
              The trend is not static; it is increasing.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, detection rates are falling. Two
              years ago almost 30% of crime was detected, and last year it was
              only 18%. In April 2002 the Assistant Chief Constable for Greater
              Belfast, Mr Alan McQuillan, said in the ‘News Letter’ that
              police detection rates are plummeting in Northern Ireland. He went
              on to say that while the level of service is dropping, detection
              rates are plummeting. Put those two facts together and one can see
              why that is. When there is a deficit of almost 2,000 police
              officers in Northern Ireland, it is no wonder that detection rates
              have dropped considerably. The House must realise that there is a
              crisis in policing that is aided and abetted by terrorists being
              at the heart of Government. It would be a dereliction of the
              Assembly’s responsibilities if it failed to acknowledge that
              that crisis exists.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will quote from crime statistics given to
              members of the Policing Board this month, because they knock on
              the head any notion, such as the view of Mr Attwood, that the
              Assembly should look at those figures frankly and fully. If the
              Assembly looks at those figures frankly and fully, it will see
              that crime detection figures are down in every sector. There were
              22,000 offences against the person this year. Only 44·6% of those
              crimes were detected. Last year, 60% were detected. The detection
              rate for sexual offences is down by 20%. Burglary has become a
              major problem across the Province — there were 15,000 last year.
              The detection rate for burglaries has plummeted from 14% last year
              to 9% this year. There were 37,000 thefts recorded this year, and
              the detection rate has dropped from 20% to 12%.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I could continue through every category. The
              ability of the police to detect crime has dropped. I am sure that
              there are Members of the House, such as the 18 who sit under the
              Gallery opposite, who applaud the fact that the police can no
              longer detect crime. That is a major success for Sinn Féin, which
              undermines policing here by encouraging people to support a
              shocking and shameful process that has reduced the Police Service
              by 2,000 members in the past year.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am also concerned that the Northern Ireland
              Office has tried to gloss over the major crime problem here. It
              recently published its organised crime task force’s report. When
              the Police Service gets it right, it should be applauded, but it
              is getting it right in fewer cases now than ever before. That is a
              sad reflection on its ability to do the job that people expect of
              it and want it to do. The reason it is not able to do its job is
              that it does not have enough officers. I must emphasise for the
              record that the Police Service should be congratulated when it
              gets it right, because it is an excellent public service, and the
              sooner it is given the resources, manpower and capability to take
              on and tackle criminals, the better. One of the major reasons why
              there is so much crime is that not only is manpower down, but
              resources are also down. The police are currently operating on an
              operational deficit of around £15 million. It is up to the NIO to
              fill the pot.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The third factor in the debate is that the
              Assembly must condemn Sinn Féin/IRA for the stance it has taken.
              I welcome the fact that the Ulster Unionist Party, the United
              Kingdom Unionist Party and the Northern Ireland Unionist Party are
              supporting the motion. The Assembly must lay the blame where is
              should be laid. The attitudes of Sinn Féin Members to the police
              are clear from the records of the House.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Molloy says that if Sinn Féin does not get
              what it wants, it will go back to what it does best. In the past
              30 years, what Sinn Féin/IRA has done best, in its eyes, is
              murder and mayhem, bombing and killing. The leader of the
              Provisional IRA/Sinn Féin, Mr Gerry Adams, has said that he will
              treat the police in the same way that the Catholic community
              treated the RUC. What a terrible indictment by the leader of a
              party that is in government. Will Sinn Féin treat the police as
              it has done for the past 30 years, by attacking, shooting and
              killing them?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chief Constable’s crime statistics show
              that there have been 113 attacks, principally organised by
              Republicans, on individual police patrols in the past year. Mr
              Adams’s comment, when considered in the light of the increased
              attacks on police officers, highlights the bankruptcy of our
              political movement, particularly when people attempt to justify
              the election of that organisation to the Government of Northern
              Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sinn Féin hands out medals of support to the
              IRA scum who killed and bombed police officers in this community.
              It is little wonder that the crime crisis is worsening. The
              organisation dares to be in government while refusing to support
              the police. Those attitudes ought not to be compatible, and it is
              a shame that some believe that they are. Sir John Gorman said that
              the electorate in the Republic saw through Sinn Féin; I only wish
              that certain people in this House would see through them. The
              sooner they do so, the more quickly we will be able to deal with
              crime.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is often implied in debates on this subject
              that, although crime is still committed, it is less serious than
              it has ever been, and we no longer face terror crime. However, the
              IRA remains armed and capable — as do Loyalist paramilitaries
              — of continuing the job that it did before. The Chief Constable’s
              most recent report shows that munitions finds were higher when the
              Government were not pressing for decommissioning than they are
              now. The police have been unable to recover as many munitions
              during this period of peace as they did while we were told that a
              war was going on.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the past year, 939 organised terrorist
              offences, designed to overthrow democracy and to ruin this state,
              were recorded. Failure to support the motion will be applauded by
              criminals throughout Northern Ireland, because they will see that
              some people in one section of the community are prepared to turn a
              blind eye to their criminality in the name of some political
              shibboleth. We must smash that shibboleth, because if we fail to
              do so, we will fail to send out a message that this House is
              opposed to crime and its causes. I support the motion.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Policing is of major and relevant concern to
              the Assembly, especially given that 10 Members sit on the Policing
              Board; albeit only three of the four parties so entitled have
              taken up their seats. Some still shirk their public responsibility
              regarding policing; the SDLP does not. Patten recommended strongly
              that community-centred policing should be a major priority in
              developing and promoting the new policing policy agenda.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Policing is a core public service that involves
              everyone in Northern Ireland. It has always been a difficult and
              controversial issue, particularly because of the major political
              difficulties regarding the operation of government structures in
              the past. Policing can only be effective when all sections of the
              community are involved in, and can identify and feel comfortable
              with, all structures of government, including a regional police
              service.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although the SDLP recognises that past, it also
              acknowledges that there have been changes. The Good Friday
              Agreement provided a template for policing. The Police Service of
              Northern Ireland (PSNI) came into being in April 2002, and already
              there have been new recruits. Two batches of probationary officers
              are now in the mainstream service. Those young men and women chose
              a Police Service career. They must be respected and supported in
              that work.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.15 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Every Member should stand up for the
              fundamental human right to choose a career or job without fear or
              intimidation. Young Nationalists who choose a career in policing
              must be allowed to realise their ambition and be respected in the
              exercise of that freedom. There must be no implied criticism of
              their wish to be police officers and no prevarication or threat to
              its achievement. Policing is a noble career for those who choose
              it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Without exception, the human rights of young
              people who choose a career in policing entitle them to respect.
              Sinn Féin has no right to victimise Nationalists or Catholics who
              join the PSNI. The last phrase of the amendments put forward by
              Sinn Féin and by the SDLP is &quot;which conforms with Human
              Rights norms.&quot; Let us practise what we preach.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I said earlier, policing has always been a
              vexed and difficult issue. Historically, political structures did
              not enjoy widespread support or allegiance. Consequently, policing
              was a casualty from the outset. The last 30 years of conflict
              emphasised that. The Good Friday Agreement, however, and the
              constituent part which relates to policing, offers a clear way
              forward. The policing problem was tackled by providing for the
              establishment of the Independent Commission on Policing for
              Northern Ireland. Patten issued a comprehensive report and a route
              map for better policing in Northern Ireland. Patten’s parameters
              and recommendations are the primary agenda for change, leading to
              the ultimate objective of an impartial, professional and widely
              accepted Police Service that delivers effective policing to
              communities across the region.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I accept that there is a rise in ODC. That term
              means &quot;ordinary, decent crime&quot; and I do not like it. Our
              communities experience difficulties and want more effective and
              efficient community-based policing to tackle them and to treat all
              sections equally. The new policing structures offer the best
              opportunity and potential to realise that objective. However, it
              requires positive commitment and work from all of us to achieve
              it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Policing is a major and challenging issue in
              every part of the western world. It was a Victorian concept and it
              was hierarchical. Like everything else, however, it must evolve
              and change. Modern societies require greater involvement of
              communities in the policing system. For that reason, the SDLP
              believes in the merits of district policing partnerships, which
              afford an opportunity to bring police closer to communities. I am
              convinced that communities — Nationalist and Unionist — want
              such partnerships to realise effective community policing.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The SDLP’s amendment is comprehensive and
              reflects the spirit of the community, which yearns for effective
              policing.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Leslie:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion does not have any bearing on my
              ministerial responsibilities. My remarks, therefore, are made as a
              private Member.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Like my Colleague, Sir John Gorman, I have no
              difficulty in supporting the motion. I suspect that crime figures
              are similar to unemployment figures. From time to time, the
              measure is changed and the numbers appear to alter, but whether
              they have increased, stayed the same, or been re-based, the level
              of crime is unconscionably high. That should be of great concern
              to the Assembly. Crime detection levels are also unsatisfactorily
              low.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The figures for Northern Ireland must be
              considered in the context of crime figures in the rest of the
              United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland. Rising crime rates are
              a serious and widespread problem, in which drugs play a
              considerable part. Nonetheless, the scale of the problem is of
              great concern to me and to society. It will require a determined
              effort from political parties, civil society, the police force and
              the judiciary to get to grips with the problem. Given that
              criminal law is a reserved matter, significant initiatives cannot
              be generated from here, although we can agitate for suitable
              initiatives.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Inevitably, the DUP and other parties to my
              right have tried to blame the Belfast Agreement for increasing
              crime levels. It is a familiar tune, which they have been singing
              for some time. Anyone who has studied the affairs of our Province
              over the past 30 years will know that when the new Secretary of
              State arrived at Belfast International Airport in June 1997 and
              said that she was going to reform the RUC, we feared the worst.
              Knowing the political journey of that particular Secretary of
              State, we feared that the outcome would be worse than our worst
              fears. Therefore, the appropriate response — the response taken
              by the Ulster Unionist Party — was to go into damage limitation
              mode. Given that the Government were bent upon reforming the RUC,
              it was best to circumscribe those reforms and ensure that the
              Government were given as much advice as possible while they were
              evolving them.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is why the Ulster Unionist Party sought,
              in the Belfast Agreement, to set terms of reference for the review
              of policing that was going to occur whether there was an agreement
              or not. It is a matter of great regret to us, and something for
              which we are all paying a price, that the Government chose to
              allow the Human Rights Commission to disregard those terms of
              reference and to implement a series of proposals that were well
              beyond anything that was envisaged when those terms of reference
              were drawn up. None the less, the Ulster Unionist Party battled on
              by tabling more than 200 amendments to the Police (Northern
              Ireland) Bill as it was going through the Houses of Parliament. It
              is significant that no other Unionist party tabled any amendments.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members must also bear in mind, and any study
              of Northern Ireland affairs since 1970 confirms, that every time
              the security forces appeared to have some success against the
              terrorists they were put under such an enormous barrage of
              publicity fire by the Republican movement that they inevitably
              stopped doing whatever it was that was proving effective. The
              history of the Government’s involvement in those affairs over
              the past 30 years shows that the consequences of the review of the
              RUC were not particularly surprising.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must consider several matters in order to
              address the crime levels. When I served on the Policing Board I
              was fortunate to be invited, with other members, by the US
              Administration to New York and Washington to look at some of the
              actions that they had taken, and also to hear about the study that
              had been done on the problems of dealing with crime. I came away
              from that trip with much food for thought.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It would be wrong for me to try to summarise
              that trip in a few moments. However, I shall make some brief
              comments. Initiatives sometimes referred to by the inaccurate
              general term of &quot;zero tolerance&quot; were launched in New
              York City and in Newark, and involved a major alliance of
              political and civil society, the police and the criminal justice
              system working together to address a common problem. It will be
              essential for us to work together, whether we try to address those
              problems in Northern Ireland, England or anywhere else. We have to
              be particularly mindful of the crucial role of the criminal
              justice system and the courts’ sentencing policies.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The inadequacy of the sentences being handed
              out bears down heavily on the morale of the police force,
              particularly after officers have gone to great trouble and effort
              and have faced other difficulties, often at personal risk, to
              bring people to court and get a conviction. I urge the Northern
              Ireland Office and the Westminster Government to look at that
              matter closely, because it is still their responsibility.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although the nominal number of police officers
              is more than double what it was in 1969, I am aware, as most
              Members are, that the numbers actually serving are very low. For
              that reason, the Ulster Unionist Party has consistently taken the
              line that the future of the full-time and part-time reserve must
              be secured to give its men and women some contractual certainty
              for the time being. Police numbers should be reviewed in a few
              years, in the light of the numbers who leave and join the force.
              In the meantime, we need every available police officer, and they
              must be given that certainty of tenure.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I endorse the comments of my Colleague, Sir
              John Gorman, and those of Members of the DUP, who said that Sinn
              Féin’s amendment, as usual, tries to re-present the issue. It
              clearly implies that there is something wrong with the current
              police force. I reject that assertion: the police have been, and
              are, doing a commendably good job in exceedingly difficult
              circumstances. I support the motion.</p>

              raise the issues and talk about crime detection rates and why we
              need more police on the streets.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sinn Féin sits in the Assembly decrying the
              new police force by saying that it does not represent the
              community. The more we hear that, the more we realise how
              discriminatory and two-faced that party’s comments are. The
              changes recommended in the Patten Report were not designed to
              catch more criminals; indeed, they have had the opposite effect.
              They have caused crime to increase. There is more crime on the
              street; more people are under threat from criminals and many
              people’s insecurity has increased.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sinn Féin thinks that the police force is not
              representative of this community. It is representative of the
              community. To take this comment to its logical conclusion, there
              would have to be a minority of Protestants on the police force for
              it to be acceptable to Sinn Féin. According to the policing
              provisions in the Northern Ireland Act 1998, 50% of the police
              force must be Roman Catholic, and the other 50% must be made up
              from the other religions in Northern Ireland. Surely Sinn Féin
              should be crowing with delight that this institutionalised
              discrimination was made legal by the Patten Report.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sinn Féin has also ensured that its old
              adversaries in Special Branch and the CID have had to leave
              because it does not consider them to be the kind of officers that
              are needed in peacetime. Perhaps the real reason that they had to
              leave is that those officers know far too much about certain
              Members and Ministers. The removal of many of those officers and
              anyone over 30 serving in the worthy and honourable Royal Ulster
              Constabulary has left this country on its knees. Youths and
              organised criminals have taken over night by night. We hear
              stories of elderly people being beaten and robbed in their homes;
              joyriding accidents leave families across the Province grieving;
              and the knife culture is getting out of control.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There have been two knife-related murders in my
              constituency in the past two months. We must ask why that is
              happening. It is happening because Sinn Féin has reduced the
              numbers of PSNI officers on the street, disbanded the RUC and
              taken away its name. The police force has been reconstructed. If
              Sinn Féin thinks that it has fooled anyone apart from its own
              people, it is breathing the thin air that some of its colleagues
              are breathing in Colombia. It is in Sinn Féin’s interest never
              to support the Police Service. In that way it can give its old IRA
              buddies something to do by providing them with a weak and
              overstretched target to have fun with, while trying to cover up
              what is going on in Colombia with civil disturbances and riots in
              flashpoint areas. By withholding support from the new Police
              Service, Sinn Féin can ensure that it does not hit one of its own
              when orchestrating riots or community attacks.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I said, two people have died as a result of
              stabbing incidents recently in my constituency. The increased use
              of knives worries me. The police cannot respond because of the
              numbers they have — or do not have — on the streets. People
              are having their property damaged by vandals who cannot be caught
              because there are not enough officers to patrol the streets, and
              people are being beaten, stabbed, shot and intimidated because the
              police force does not have enough officers to ensure that it knows
              what is happening so that it can safeguard people against crimes.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My constituency of Strangford is a large area
              with crime rates that make it sound like the wild west. Post
              office robberies are a source of concern. Elderly people are
              victims because the offices are targeted on pension day. The area
              has a proud tradition of people from both sides of the community
              and both religious persuasions joining the police. The situation
              is indefensible. We need officers, but unfortunately we cannot get
              them because Sinn Féin has depleted the force and left the whole
              country susceptible to the baser side of the human race. I support
              the motion.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome this timely opportunity to debate the
              vital issues of the rise in crime and the acts of Sinn Féin and
              the Republican movement over the past few months. The Westminster
              Government are weak on policing. I welcome the Secretary of State’s
              initiative of creating a task force with a remit to tackle
              organised crime. It has had some notable success. However, a
              concerted effort is needed to right the wrongs in our society,
              because every time the police force has been successful, it has
              had its wings clipped.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Cash robberies here amount to one fifth of the
              UK total. The amount of counterfeit goods seized in 2001 was
              greater than the total in the rest of the United Kingdom. Most of
              this crime is in areas where Sinn Féin’s supporters reside. The
              extent of the problems that confront us is clear. The effects of
              claims are demonstrated by the overly high insurance premiums that
              are burdening businesses and vehicle owners alike. We know well
              the problems before us. Fuel smuggling, alcohol and drug abuse and
              thuggery have their roots in Republican paramilitary organisations
              in Republican areas. Being a democrat, I am opposed to all
              criminal acts, particularly punishment beatings. I recognise that
              such beatings have become almost a daily occurrence. I urge the
              Government to show law-abiding citizens that crime does not pay.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As we know, Sinn Féin and its Republican
              following are acting irresponsibly. To support the forces of law
              and order would not be consistent for a party that attempted to
              undermine law and order in the Province for over 30 years, that
              has a structure of a political wing and a military wing and that
              believes it is judge, jury and executioner.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most of our problems require apposite actions.
              It is fine for Sinn Féin to talk about getting rid of Special
              Branch, but what about Sinn Féin’s secret special branch that
              targets Government officials? What sort of society do we live in
              when ambulance and hospital personnel constantly come under attack
              while carrying out their duties? Young people in north Belfast and
              elsewhere must no longer have a free rein to attack the security
              forces and citizens. Sinn Féin and its Republican army must
              accept their share of the blame for the situation. It is surely
              double standards for Sinn Féin, on the one hand, to hold the
              office of Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety
              and, on the other hand, to allow its party supporters to
              intimidate people and to carry out crime at a cost to the
              taxpayer. Any political party that teaches and encourages young
              people to have no regard for law and order must answer for the
              consequences.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Westminster Government must also shoulder
              responsibility for failing our judicial system. Even if
              perpetrators of crime are caught, they will probably not be dealt
              with appropriately. The Westminster Government are weak on
              administering deterrents to crime. We need more effective
              deterrents.</p>

              through the Patten Report, that have undermined policing in
              Northern Ireland, brought the manpower of the police to below
              7,000 — it was 9,000 — and brought about the present increase

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The current levels of crime are extremely
              worrying, and, in particular, I want to draw attention to my own
              constituency of South Belfast, which has been experiencing a
              significant upsurge in crime levels. I have represented the
              constituency of South Belfast for the past four years and never
              has the issue of crime been of such prominence.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will detail the types of crimes that have
              been perpetrated in my area. Only recently the body of a
              39-year-old woman was pulled from the River Lagan, a murder took
              place in the Markets area and an armed robbery took place at a
              fast-food restaurant on the Donegall Road. In recent months two
              students have been viciously attacked in their home, elderly
              residents have been attacked and robbed in their homes, and there
              have been numerous armed robberies. In fact, the owner of a local
              newsagent situated close to my constituency office has been the
              victim of armed robbery on six occasions in the last seven months.
              There has been a 42% increase in sex attacks in South Belfast in
              this year alone. This is an extremely worrying situation, and,
              unfortunately, the people who suffer are the decent law-abiding
              citizens who live in the area.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">James Leslie was correct to say that we should
              compare our crime figures with those in other parts of the island.
              However, whatever our crime rates might be, it must be
              acknowledged that most people in Northern Ireland are civil and
              orderly. There are difficulties, and they may become more intense
              in some areas of the North. However, those difficulties must be
              considered in the context of our community’s, by and large,
              upholding good and decent family and community values.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir John Gorman asked me directly why the SDLP
              could not support the motion. I understand why he supports the
              wording of the motion. However, he would appreciate that we wanted
              to consider its subtext, and it is clear from contributions that
              the motion is anti-Patten in intention and substance. It would be
              alien to our political beliefs and our support of the Patten
              Commission Report to support a motion that is anti-Patten. Given
              what ensued during the debate, it is inconceivable that we could
              support the motion.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Alex Maskey asked how the people of east
              Belfast and the Short Strand were to experience the new beginning
              to policing, given recent events in that community. I will not
              walk away from that question, because if any policing is wrong, we
              are prepared to say so and to propose corrective strategies. If
              there is good policing, we are prepared to acknowledge that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although people may demean the work of the
              Police Ombudsman, no investigative office in the world that deals
              with complaints against the police has more powers or resources to
              call erring police officers and a police service to account. When
              the police raid houses in a way that breaches proper standards and
              human rights, as happened in east Belfast and in Derry after the
              Castlereagh break-in, we are prepared to tell the police that they
              should review protocols and change them, and enforce orders that
              govern how they conduct themselves in such raids. When police
              officers offend human rights substantially, and there is prima
              facie evidence to support that contention, those officers should
              be suspended, pending a full investigation into their activities.
              That strategy will correct wrongful policing. Some people hope
              that the SDLP gets policing wrong so that they can gain political
              advantage.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Norman Boyd asked about the availability of
              officers in police stations. That is a valid point. In too many
              areas of the North, there are not enough police officers on the
              ground.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To return to what Bob McCartney said, if Bangor
              were compared to a town of a similar size in Britain, the current
              quota of police officers in north Down would outweigh that in
              Britain.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Bob McCartney referred to 20% of officers in
              north Down being on long-term sick leave. He also referred to the
              excessive numbers of police officers who are on special protection
              duties for notables in north Down. Many police officers are on
              restricted duties, and many are based in police stations and
              police headquarters rather than on the ground.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To say that the problem is about numbers and
              that the numbers should be increased, thereby protecting the
              full-time Reserve, misses the real issue about management of
              manpower in the police. There are not sufficient numbers on the
              ground because there are too many in police stations and police
              buildings, too many involved in desk duties, too many on sick
              leave, too many on VIP protection and too many on restricted
              duties.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A manpower strategy is required to free more
              police to serve more communities in more towns, villages and
              hamlets around the North. Merely protecting the full-time Reserve
              will not get to grips with the fundamental issue of manpower.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ian Paisley Jnr said that people from
              constituencies around the North, including West Belfast, were
              joining the Police Service. He suggested that I said it is
              proportionate to the numbers living in those constituencies. It is
              not. In every constituency people, even those who have had
              difficult experiences of policing over the past 30 years, now have
              the confidence to join the Police Service.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In her report on the Omagh bombing Nuala O’Loan
              said that she got five and a half out of six for what the Policing
              Board did. In my view, she got six and a half out of six. The
              Policing Board, by having a presence at board level and on the
              ground in Omagh, will ensure that the investigation brings those
              who are guilty of that crime to justice. It is a far superior
              model of accountability and investigation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I challenge anyone to read what I, or Joe
              Byrne, have said in this debate and confirm to us what one Member

              Alex Maskey said, we share the concerns in the motion about the
              levels of crime, especially against the elderly. However, as the
              debate has unfolded it is evident that it is not about policing.
              It is about a continuation of the attempted demonisation of Sinn
              Féin — an attempt to make Sinn Féin a scapegoat. It is ironic
              that the DUP brought this motion to the Floor of the House. The
              first RUC man to be murdered in the past 30 years was murdered on
              the Shankill Road in a political climate that had been engendered
              by the leader of the DUP and in a political environment that it
              had sought to stir up against the RUC. The DUP’s stated policy
              was to oppose the RUC because the RUC did not fulfil its desires
              or wishes.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are Members on the other side of the

              party that brought the motion to the House had with regard to
              policing in the Six Counties. It was not a very honourable policy
              on, or commitment to, policing, and that continues. Policing was
              OK as long as it was OK with the DUP. Policing was OK as long as
              the doors of Fenian houses were being battered down and as long as
              the status quo, according to the DUP, was being upheld. It is
              hypocritical of that party to bring to the Floor of the Chamber a
              motion that condemns, or attempts to condemn, Sinn Féin for its

              out-fox the Official Unionist Party. That is the aim of the
              motion; it is not about policing. It does not address the

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Perhaps when you are looking at Hansard, Madam
              Deputy Speaker, you will also look at the ‘Magill’ magazine
              documentary that outlined the career of the Member who raised the
              point of order. What this debate has shown is that Sinn Féin runs
              scared of any policing issue; it always wants to pass the blame.
              Alex Maskey blames the police for car crime in west Belfast. The
              fact that, for 30 years, the party to which he belongs encouraged
              car theft so that joyriders could run around west Belfast, going
              through roadblocks, stretching police resources, has been totally
              ignored. Sinn Féin says that is all the fault of the police.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the Short Strand recently, it was the police’s
              fault that a mob, organised and led by IRA/Sinn Féin, came onto
              the streets. When the police respond, they are accused of beating
              young Nationalists. Sinn Féin want to be treated as democrats;
              however, when they see any acceptance of the police materialising
              in Nationalist areas, they create the situations that led to the
              confrontation that resulted in the police’s having to take
              action to defend themselves and a vulnerable Protestant community
              on the outskirts of the Short Strand. Such action enabled Sinn
              Féin to say that the police have not changed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those people have manipulated circumstances in
              Northern Ireland to ensure that the police are not accepted,
              despite all the changes that have been made. John Kelly’s rant
              is an indication that Sinn Féin does not like to be faced with
              the truth of its attitude and actions towards policing in Northern
              Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to address some of Alex Attwood’s
              points. I accept that the SDLP has made sacrifices by signing up
              to the Policing Board, yet I do not agree with everything that it
              has done or said. The Policing Board has conducted robust debates.
              Nevertheless, I accept that the SDLP has at least been prepared to
              play a part in policing. It is a pity that, after the speech that
              he made, Mr Attwood felt the need to hang on Sinn Féin’s
              coat-tails. He talked about suspending police officers because of
              the crescendo of cries from Sinn Féin representatives when the
              police enter areas to take action against rioters. That will only
              help to demoralise the police further.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When talking about police numbers, Mr Attwood
              says that it is not merely about protecting the full-time Reserve
              — he steers away from that difficult question. The SDLP will
              have to make up its mind. What do we do with 2,500 officers who
              are needed on the streets, but are demoralised because their
              contracts have not been renewed, and who are treated far worse
              than any other workers that I know of in Northern Ireland?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The SDLP will have to make up its mind about
              what it will do about those officers.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I expected some washing of the hands in this
              debate by Ulster Unionist Party Members. It was odd to hear Billy
              Armstrong talk about the political and military wing of IRA/Sinn
              Féin and the fact that it was a scandal to have a Sinn Féin
              Health Minister who allowed crime — a drain on the Northern
              Ireland taxpayer — to continue. However, how did the Minister of
              Health achieve her position? Billy Armstrong — from what I
              remember — walked through one of the Lobbies to put her there.
              One cannot condemn Sinn Féin/IRA for its attitude to policing on

              positions.</p>

              representatives wagging their fingers and accusing each other of
              not living up to their obligations. However, we have brought the
              motion because the Assembly has a collective responsibility to
              take action on this matter.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Paragraph 18 of strand 2 of the agreement

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The Northern Ireland Assembly and the
              Oireachtas to consider developing a joint parliamentary forum,
              bringing together equal numbers from both institutions for
              discussion of matters of mutual interest and concern.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion addresses that. It instructs the
              Speaker to nominate Members to engage in discussions with the
              authorities in the Oireachtas. It is not a prescriptive
              resolution. It does not define the outcome; it simply paves the
              way for the establishment of a joint forum in which matters of
              mutual interest can be discussed. For example, it might provide a
              format in which informal contacts in Committees could be
              maintained more significantly. It will certainly provide an
              opportunity for people from the Assembly to inform TDs of the real
              concerns of Northern Ireland’s people. I have no doubt that
              Northern Ireland is ignorant of the realities of life in the
              Republic. However, ignorance in the Republic of the realities of
              life here is vast.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation was
              established in Dublin in the wake of the 1994 ceasefires, Alliance
              was the only non-Nationalist party from either part of the island
              to attend, along with the independent Senator, the late Gordon
              Wilson. I have no doubt that my party’s presence, and the formal
              and informal contacts we made, assisted Southern representatives
              to understand the concerns of people across the breadth of opinion
              in Northern Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It would have been better had Unionists been
              there to put their own cases. I repeat that whatever ignorance
              there may be in Northern Ireland regarding matters in the
              Republic, there is no doubt that the Republic’s ignorance of
              matters in Northern Ireland is even greater. Some of the
              suggestions put forward by Alliance on difficult issues, such as
              the recognition of Northern teaching qualifications in the
              Republic for anybody who wishes to move South, or the future of
              the Adelaide Hospital with its Protestant foundation, made some
              TDs and Senators sit up. That confrontation was necessary. The
              problems of sectarian thinking in official policy are the same
              down there are they are up here, and TDs and Senators must still
              be confronted about them. The issues of equality and human rights
              do not concern only Northern Ireland, but are prevalent in both
              jurisdictions.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion as it stands is a relatively easy
              one for Nationalists; however, it is important that Unionists also
              show a willingness to play their part in improving relationships
              across the island, without retreating into the laager mentality
              preferred by some of their anti-agreement members. The Ulster
              Unionist Party leadership must lead its followers. Having signed
              up to the agreement in 1998, they should put in place its full
              operation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was surprised and interested to hear on the
              BBC that representatives from the Office of the First Minister and
              the Deputy First Minister discussed this matter in Dublin last
              night. Members have heard me complain on numerous occasions about
              the failings of the Executive, the inadequacies of legislation,
              the difficulty in bringing in the Programme for Government. Those
              matters are the direct responsibility of Ministers. Yet it seems
              — because no official spokesman for OFMDFM has denied the
              reports that I heard on the BBC last night — that they had time
              to discuss this motion in a meeting between Government Ministers.
              This motion has nothing to do with the Executive or the Cabinet in
              Dublin. It is a matter for the Assembly and the Oireachtas to
              debate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members from both parties that are represented
              in OFMDFM are in the Chamber. During the course of the debate,
              will they ask their Ministers to tell Members whether there was
              truth in the BBC’s story; whether the story was leaked to the
              BBC by OFMDFM; and whether they discussed the motion? Will they
              tell us the outcome of the discussions? Will they support the
              motion to ensure that the Assembly lives up to this part of its
              responsibilities under the agreement, because that is what the
              motion is for, and that is what the Assembly should do? I commend
              the motion.</p>

              gaining mutual benefit through such co-operation, but we must
              consider the wording of the motion carefully. It adopts an
              imperative tone, and talks about instructing the Speaker. That
              contrasts with paragraph 18 of strand two, which says only that
              consideration should be given to creating such a body, so Mr Ford’s
              motion goes too far.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although the motion may be incompetent, that
              does not necessarily require the UUP to table an amendment. The
              UUP is not against North/South discussions per se. However, we
              stress the need for a careful evaluation of whether a new
              institution should be created under the agreement. Given that
              several institutions have been established, it seems sensible to
              evaluate the potential costs and benefits of creating another one.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is especially the case given that several
              organisations, such as the Civic Forum, the Northern Ireland
              Economic Council and the Economic Development Forum, can interact
              with their counterparts in the Republic to facilitate discussion
              on North/South issues of mutual benefit to civic society and
              promote co-operation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The role of the Assembly may be raised. The
              Assembly has exercised its scrutiny power to maintain the budgets
              of the implementation bodies of the North/ South Ministerial
              Council. Similarly, the Assembly’s Committees can scrutinise the
              six North/South implementation bodies and the six areas of
              co-operation through existing agencies. Therefore, it is by no
              means self-evident that a further consultative body, linking the
              Dáil and the Assembly, would be beneficial, but we must consider
              the benefits against the costs — a measure for which the
              agreement provides.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I caution against accepting the motion because
              it would inevitably add to the workload of several Members and
              disrupt the Assembly’s business. If passed, the motion would
              lead to Members having to attend meetings with their counterparts
              in the Southern institutions, and, of course, that would take
              Members away from plenary and Committee sessions. That point was
              discussed at length today in the context of how Members’
              involvement in other bodies might lead to a reduction in the
              effectiveness of the Assembly.</p>

              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr A Maginness:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome Mr Ford’s motion. Dr Birnie’s
              speech reminds me of the curate’s egg: it is good in parts and
              equally bad in others.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Good Friday Agreement imposed a duty on the
              Assembly to consider developing a joint parliamentary forum, and
              the motion points to that obligation. It is disingenuous of
              Unionists to claim that, technically, the motion goes too far, and
              it is too imperative. Dr Birnie failed in his valiant attempt to
              justify the Unionist position. We must properly consider a
              North/South parliamentary forum. I take comfort that Dr Birnie, on
              behalf of his party, does not reject a North/South parliamentary
              forum, but rather delays consideration of it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us consider the benefits of a forum. As
              Committee members, we have met and participated in useful
              discussions with Members of the Oireachtas and Committees of Dáil
              Éireann. I am sure that my old friend Sir John Gorman recalls an
              interesting and productive meeting of the Ad Hoc Committee on the
              Proceeds of Crime Bill with TDs and members of the Garda
              Síochána.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No Unionist in the House — and I include the
              DUP — has anything to fear from a joint parliamentary forum.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr William McCrea:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us speak for ourselves.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr A Maginness:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am sure that Rev Dr McCrea will speak for
              himself. He is more than capable of doing so.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unionists have nothing to fear from engaging
              with parliamentarians south of the border, and vice versa.
              Similarly, parliamentarians from throughout Europe have nothing to
              fear from engaging with their counterparts in other jurisdictions.
              The motion is not a threat to Unionists. There is much to learn
              from an interchange of views. The proposal is not to establish a
              covert all-Ireland parliament, much as I would love to see that.
              Rather, it is an attempt to bring people from North and South
              together in politics.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should develop a policy of good
              neighbourliness between the North and the South.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What is there to fear from that? Unionists will
              remain Unionists; Nationalists will remain Nationalists, and
              Republicans and Loyalists will also remain the same. The SDLP
              supports the motion. The proposed arrangement is part of the
              agreement; it is centred in the agreement, and the mandate for
              this House comes from the agreement. A joint forum is part of the
              process of reconciliation between the people of Ireland, North and
              South, and it is important to develop that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Public representatives from North and South
              meet in other political spheres. Our councillors — and not only
              those along the border — whether Unionist or Nationalist, SDLP
              or Sinn Féin, meet with colleagues in the South. They meet under
              the auspices of the Local Authority Members Association (LAMA).
              Many Members have engaged in those meetings and found them to be
              productive and useful. If councillors can meet at that level, why
              can we not meet at the most important level of politics in
              Northern Ireland?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I reiterate to my Unionist Colleagues and
              friends that there is nothing to fear from this. The North/South
              Ministerial Council deals with Executive functions and policies
              between the two Governments. The Council is subject to the
              critical examination of the Assembly. However, a joint forum would
              involve Members of this Assembly meeting Members of Dáil Éireann
              and Seanad Éireann to discuss all sorts of common issues. That
              would be of great benefit to all our people, North and South. I
              support the motion, and I hope that Unionist colleagues will
              refrain from opposing the motion and will wish it well.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Campbell:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, I must make it clear that I, and many of
              my Colleagues, have tried to respond positively over the years to
              invitations from the Irish Republic to go to that country and make
              our views known on why we are distinct and different — why
              Northern Ireland is a separate entity, jurisdiction and country
              and will remain so over the decades and further into the future.
              Mr Davis frequently mentions the 1982 Assembly in the Chamber —
              why should he not do so? I recall, back in those halcyon days,
              shortly after being elected to that Assembly, going to the
              Republic to what was almost the shadow of the Dáil to tell people
              exactly why Northern Ireland would remain separate from the Irish
              Republic. It is a separate entity, a separate country, and it will
              never, ever be united with the Irish Republic.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I take the motion at face value. I do not doubt
              in any way the Alliance Party leader’s motive for the motion or
              call into question his rationale for it. If a joint forum would
              simply promote greater dialogue on issues of mutual interest and
              concern between Northern Ireland and the Republic, I would welcome
              it. However, we must examine the evidence and rationale under the
              terms of the Belfast Agreement.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some four years ago, the First Minister said
              that the counterbalance to the North/South pressure — the North/
              South Ministerial Council and the greater involvement on a
              North/South basis — would be involvement on an east-west basis:
              the British-Irish contingency.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Therefore I asked how many British-Irish
              Council and North/South Ministerial Council meetings had taken
              place. Not to my, or anyone else’s, surprise, I was told that
              there had been 50 North/South Ministerial Council meetings and
              five British-Irish Council meetings. Ten times more emphasis is
              placed on Council meetings on the North/South axis than on the
              natural east-west axis. That appears to lie at the heart of the
              North/South promotion.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Alban Maginness, who unfortunately is not in
              the Chamber, makes the case that Unionists will still be Unionists
              after North/South discussions, and Nationalists will still be
              Nationalists. He does not seem to understand that the difference
              is that when Nationalists take part in east-west discussions, no
              Conservative, Labour, Liberal Democrat or other politician in
              Great Britain wants Nationalists to be British. No one engaged in
              east-west dialogue wants to build a political basis that will in
              some way encompass the Nationalist viewpoint and make Nationalists
              feel that they are British. However, an examination of
              &quot;North/Southery&quot; shows that it is designed to make
              Unionists feel more Irish. That is always at the root of it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many people in the Nationalist and Republican
              community want to develop education in a North/South context —
              an all-Ireland context. Higher education, tourism, health,
              agriculture, economic development, policing — there is no end to
              the issues that Nationalists and Republicans want to develop on a
              North/South basis. Is it simply to get more effective policing or
              a better education system? Of course it is not. If it were simply
              that, they would sit down with Unionists in Northern Ireland and
              discuss the problems. Efforts would be made to determine the fault
              lines in education, health, tourism or whatever, and methods would
              be devised to improve them.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, Nationalists and Republicans seem to
              think that improvement equals &quot;North/Southery&quot;; that a
              better education system and better economic development are
              possible only on an all-Ireland basis. They can approach any issue
              and turn it into greater North/South co-operation. For about seven
              years there has been a nonsensical attitude in the Irish Republic,
              and even in the Nationalist and Republican community, that tries
              to take the sharp edge off Irishness and remove aggressive
              behaviour on St Patrick’s Day. They do that not because they
              want more people to celebrate St Patrick’s Day but because they
              want Unionists to think that they can now embrace this sense of
              Irishness.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unfortunately, although I do not attribute any
              of this rationale to Mr Ford or his underlying analysis for
              suggesting the forum, that is what lies at the root of any
              proposals that I have ever seen for North/South co-operation. I
              speak as someone who goes frequently to the Irish Republic, and
              who will continue to do so, not because I am open to being
              persuaded to do the impossible — to become an Irish citizen —
              or to accept that Irish nationhood can be expanded to take account
              of my Britishness, because it cannot — [<i>Interruption</i>].</p>

              let me finish. No Nationalist or Republican will go to an
              east-west set of talks and sit beside people on the British side
              of the argument trying to persuade them that they are British and
              that their sense of Irishness is misplaced. However, that is what
              I come up against every time I go to the Irish Republic — that I
              am a misplaced Irishman — and in some way they are trying to
              change Irishness to make me feel that I am Irish.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The SDLP and Members from Dáil Éireann
              participate in the British-Irish parliamentary tier, while,
              unfortunately, Unionists do not. What is the difference between
              those forums? They may have different personnel, but they are
              essentially the same sort of forum. We do participate.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Campbell:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was not accusing Mr Maginness or Nationalists
              of non-participation, but he inadvertently makes my point for me.
              He knows that the origin of the parliamentary tier that he refers
              to was the Anglo-Irish Agreement, which, like the Belfast
              Agreement, Unionists viewed as an attempt to make us feel Irish
              when we are not and never, ever will be. There is nothing that
              anyone can do in the Irish Republic or in the Gaelic or Irish
              tradition that will make Unionists feel less British. Even if the
              British Government do not want us, it does not matter. We will be
              no less British.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member makes my point for me when he refers
              to a body that was viewed with suspicion for precisely the reason
              that I have given — the wish was to establish a forum where
              Unionists could gradually, over time be shown that the Irish
              Republic is not the big, bad nation that they feel it to be.
              Perhaps over time they can get accustomed to the Irish language,
              the Irish culture and everything about the Irish nation state.
              That is the seedbed of the Belfast Agreement.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is why we so oppose the Ulster Unionists.
              Whether they recognise it or not, they are blindly encompassing a
              scenario that will eventually — not tomorrow, next week or next
              month, but over a period of years — lead to them and those like
              them who are defeatist in outlook saying, as some already are,
              that perhaps Irish nationhood is not so bad now because it has
              been changed. Articles 2 and 3 have been dropped, and their
              outlook has changed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not want in any way to undermine the bona
              fides of the Alliance Party, which moved this motion for its own
              perfectly legitimate reasons. I simply do not accept those
              reasons. I do not accept that those who would be promoting the
              forum, those who would be behind it and those who would find it a
              useful tool would simply say to the Alliance Party: &quot;This is
              nice as far as it goes, and we will allow it to sit here and
              promote greater dialogue between North and South&quot;. They would
              conveniently hitch it onto their own agenda, as they have hitched
              everything else. It would be used to drive forward the North/South
              bandwagon, which we as traditional Unionists will resist for years
              and decades to come.</p>

              mhaith liom labhairt i bhfabhar na tairisceana atáimid a
              chaibidil inniu. I support the motion. It is surprising that Mr
              Campbell is surprised that Members have an agenda. That reminds me
              of a Member accusing another Member of making a political speech
              one day. Mr Campbell seems so secure in one breath in his Unionism
              and Britishness, yet in another breath he is afraid of the
              political cat.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Birnie’s remarks are at best unenlightened
              and lacking in generosity. Splitting hairs and dancing on the head
              of a pin is in no way convincing.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Perhaps Dr Birnie drew the short straw in the
              group in having to defend the indefensible. Perhaps Mr Campbell is
              right. Perhaps it is because of an impending election — meaning
              that there will be more of the same unenlightenment in the months
              ahead, with the rejection of specific aspects of the Good Friday
              Agreement, which the UUP has already endorsed. That position is
              neither honest nor sustainable.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am challenged to be measured in my comments,
              and that is very difficult. Unionist councillors and Ministers are
              heavily involved in cross-border arrangements, as has been
              outlined by Mr Alban Maginness. Why then is the middle tier of
              political office not involved, given that there is ministerial
              co-operation and councillor co-operation? For example, Unionist
              councillors on Omagh District Council have their hands up to go to
              conferences south of the border before they even know what is at
              issue. Everyone in Omagh District Council knows that when
              Killarney or Clare, or any of the annual conference venues, is
              mentioned, the Unionist hands go up. It is only then that they
              find out what the conference is about. I will not name those
              Unionist members who queue up weekly in an orderly fashion in
              their jeeps at Emyvale, Lifford and just south of Newry for cheap
              diesel.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I commend the Alliance Party for tabling the
              motion. It is not strong enough. Why is there delay over something
              that should happen immediately? It should have happened yesterday.
              The establishment of an all-island body for Members of the
              Assembly and Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas is a
              priority for my party. It is consistent with the principles and
              ethos of the Good Friday Agreement, and it is accurately detailed
              in the wording of the motion, where reference is made to
              &quot;strand two, paragraph 18&quot;. Agus as Gaeilge:</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the core, there is a recognition of the
              centrality and importance of North/South relations, the importance
              of national reconciliation on the island, and the need to develop
              consultation, co-operation and action in the island of Ireland on
              those matters. That is already happening in the implementation
              bodies established through the North/South Ministerial Council: An
              Foras Teanga, Waterways Ireland, Tourism Ireland, the Special EU
              Programmes Body and others.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A joint parliamentary forum involving
              parliamentarians in the Twenty-six Counties and Assembly Members
              in the North must be established. Why? What would such a forum do?
              A great deal of material could be discussed and developed with a
              sense of purpose and urgency. That would include the implications
              of ‘Ireland, North and South: A Statistical Profile’, a
              document released recently, tourism promotion and health planning
              and provision, ignoring the boundaries and health bureaucracies in
              the country for the benefit of all citizens. It would focus on the
              removal of duplication and double provision and on seamless
              provision and the cost-effective delivery of health services. It
              would also include the working of the North/South Ministerial
              Council An Chomhairle Aireachta Thuaidh/Theas, the study of
              obstacles to mobility — plenty of food for thought there — and
              presenting Ireland as a unit for the development of the
              hard-pressed agricultural sector, North and South.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We could learn how the Industrial Development
              Agency might secure inward investment. I welcome the fact that
              Alban Maginness referred to the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary
              Body, Comhlacht Idirpharlaiminteach na hÉireann-na Breataine.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As an Irish citizen and an elected Member of
              this House, I am happy to sit on the body — it has become known
              as &quot;the body&quot;, if anyone wants a laugh — in an
              expression of the east-west relationships, which is not my forte,
              as everyone will know.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I participate in the body on behalf of Sinn
              Féin in a spirit of reconciliation with my colleague Caoimhghin
              Ó Caoláin, TD.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The body was formally established in 1990 as a
              link between the Dáil and the British Parliament, and its origins
              lie in the joint studies report initiated by Margaret Thatcher and
              Charles Haughey in 1980. In 1990, agreement was reached on formal
              constitutional rules. It was agreed that two plenary sessions
              would be held each year and would alternate between Ireland and
              Britain and that the structure would include four committees. The
              aim was to contribute to mutual understanding through the body’s
              work and through informal contacts.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">High-profile people such as John Reid and
              Taoiseach Bertie Ahern have been involved, and there have been
              high-profile addresses and exchanges. Michael Mates plays a part,
              as does Sinn Féin. The structure includes 25 Members of the House
              of Commons and the House of Lords in Westminster; 25 TDs and
              Senators from the Twenty-six Counties; five from this Assembly and
              others from Wales, Scotland, Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Surprisingly, in one sense, Unionists are not
              playing their part in the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body,
              with the exception of people such as Lord Glentoran. Unionists
              appear to have no confidence in that body, despite all the talk
              about Britishness, sovereignty, the future security of the Union
              and about Unionists playing their part. They are certainly not
              playing their part in the British-Irish Parliamentary Body —
              another political cat that they seem afraid of.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The steering committee includes two
              co-chairmen, the outgoing TD Michael O’Kennedy and the MP David
              Winnick. Sean Neeson has also become a member, and Joe Hendron,
              who will make a substantive contribution, will soon replace Carmel
              Hanna. I have attended three plenary sessions, in Galway,
              Killarney and England, and that has enabled me to make political
              and social contacts and friendships despite political differences.
              There is dialogue on an east-west basis, but the Ulster Unionist
              Party is opposed to its taking place on a North/South basis. That
              attitude is very unenlightened, and we may read more into it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Where is the Ulster Unionist Party’s
              political will to realise all aspects of the Good Friday
              Agreement? The delays are unreasonable and unacceptable. One of
              the reasons Sinn Féin is in the Assembly is the all-Ireland
              dimension. I am not afraid to say that, nor do I apologise for it.
              I am not going to dress that fact up in any way. We bought into
              the agreement so that that dimension could be realised. Our
              objective is to see the eventual establishment of a single
              parliament in Ireland, with jurisdiction over the entire country.
              We do not bury the fact that that is part of our ideology and
              philosophy, but we have no confidence in the Unionist will to
              engage.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sinn Féin Members will meet party colleagues
              in the forum when it is established in the near future — and it
              will be established. We have much in common with TDs and Senators
              in the rest of the country. I congratulate my colleagues, TDs
              Caoimhghin Ó Caoláin, Sean Crow, Aenghus Ó Snodaigh, Arthur
              Morgan and Martin Ferris, on their five-star performance in recent
              elections.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Every aspect of the North/South dimension of
              the Good Friday Agreement must be developed across all Government
              Departments and as outlined in the Alliance motion.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Roche:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Northern Ireland, the system of government
              and administration contains roughly the following: 26 councils,
              108 MLAs, a North/South Ministerial Council, an Intergovernmental
              Conference, 18 MPs, three MEPs, five education and library boards,
              four health and social service boards and innumerable quangos. The
              proposal is to add another element to that highly complex system.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I oppose the proposal and will speak about two
              fundamental issues that must be considered. The first is that that
              complex system of government is unaccountable.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.00pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Its unaccountability breeds incompetence. In
              particular, once someone is appointed under the d’Hondt system,
              which is like a lottery, it is impossible for the Assembly to
              remove that person, no matter how incompetent he or she may be.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The risk of incompetence that the proposal
              creates is highlighted by the &quot;star performer&quot; in the
              Executive’s league of incompetence. Every MLA will have received
              correspondence from Health Service professionals who have nothing
              against the Belfast Agreement per se, but believe that the
              Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety lacks
              policies to deal with the crisis of demand for services and
              operates no ongoing decision-making on the annual allocation of
              resources. In other words, there is a core element of incompetence
              in the Department, which, under the complex arrangements, cannot
              be removed. To create further complexity would simply obscure the
              unaccountability of Departments and reinforce the increasing
              incompetence that is perceived in the Executive.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Within the North/South arrangements established
              under the Belfast Agreement, economic policy-making in Northern
              Ireland has an increasingly all-Ireland focus, which is the
              objective of the institutions. Focus is shifting from the United
              Kingdom context, the only economic and social structure that is of
              real relevance to Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland, as a small
              area of economic activity, is highly integrated into the UK
              context, economically and politically.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The significance of that shift of context can
              be discerned in agricultural policy-making. On the one hand, the
              Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development pays enormous
              attention to the North/South Ministerial Council and makes
              speeches in Brussels on matters that lie outside her competence,
              highlighting the more absurd elements of SDLP policy for bringing
              about a so-called Europe of the regions. On the other hand, two
              recent expensive, glossy publications, ‘Vision for the Future of
              the Agri-Food Industry in Northern Ireland’ and ‘Department of
              Agriculture and Rural Development Business Strategy 2002’ have
              promising titles, but contain no policy that is relevant to
              Northern Ireland as an agricultural community in the UK. That is
              highly significant, because a mid-term review will take place in
              June.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Agriculture and Rural
              Development has developed no concrete strategic policy. Therefore,
              it has not contributed to the UK negotiating position in order to
              represent the interests of Northern Ireland agriculture in the
              mid-term review. That is a crucial failure. By adding the
              significant dimension of another North/South or all-Ireland body,
              we are simply accelerating the shift away from the only context in
              which Northern Ireland policy should be made.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not the only critic of the absence of
              strategic policy and the concentration on insignificant
              all-Ireland aspects of Northern Ireland agriculture. In today’s
              ‘News Letter’, Dr Brian Scott, the executive director of Oxfam
              said that</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;it is high time that the vision document’s
              platitudes were replaced with an honest, open and realistic public
              debate about the grave issues facing Northern Ireland
              agribusiness.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In other words, he says that the so-called
              vision report is devoid of any real content. The Minister has, in
              a sense, conceded her incapacity. In a recent statement, she
              referred to the limited scope of Northern Ireland representatives
              to shape the eventual outcome of CAP reform. The Minister

              inability and failure to contribute real policy towards the UK
              negotiating position in the crucial area of agriculture. That is
              happening because of too much nonsensical concentration on a
              totally irrelevant all-Ireland context.</p>

              be sacked. She would be dismissed for being entirely incapable of
              doing her job, but there is no way that that can be done.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The relevance of my remarks is quite simple. We
              have a North/South dimension to our institutions that distracts
              from the proper context for policy-making, and that gives rise to
              vacuous government for Northern Ireland with regard to its real
              needs. It does not surprise me that the individual who rose to his
              feet does not understand that simple point. I do not think that
              there would be any simple point that he could understand.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To put the matter bluntly, the proposal is
              stupid. That should not be a surprise, given that it has emanated
              from the Alliance Party. I do not want to be offensive to its
              Members, but the Alliance Party is the party of political
              stupidity in Northern Ireland. That has been a core characteristic
              of that party under all its leaderships, without exception. It is
              not only the party of — <i>[Interruption].</p>

              in Northern Ireland, it is the party of moral duplicity. What lies
              behind the proposal is a further attempt by the Alliance Party to
              accommodate the agenda of terrorism on this island. That is what
              it is really about. It did so recently, under the self-delusion
              that by re-designating itself, it could somehow make some massive
              change in the voting systems of how appointments are made here.
              Having been kicked in the political anatomy by the British
              Government, it is still at the same old game. The party is morally
              duplicitous, and in terms of political know-how or savvy, it is
              stupid to its very core.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir John Gorman:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I cannot possibly hope to emulate Mr Roche. I
              shall simply provide some observations on my experience of
              North/South co-operation. My first experience of it was with a
              charming lady, Judge Catherine McGuinness, who is the chairperson
              of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation in the South of Ireland.
              When I was appointed chairperson of the Forum for Political
              Dialogue in Northern Ireland I made a point of meeting her. We had
              a most helpful conversation that bore out the point with which I
              intended to end my speech, which is &quot;vive la différence&quot;.
              For those who do not speak French, that means, &quot;long live the
              difference&quot;.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That forum was rather ineffective. It enabled
              political parties to set out their prospectuses, but it did not
              result in the dialogue that built up in the Northern Ireland Forum
              for Political Dialogue, which I hope played a small part in
              creating the Assembly and the adversarial system evident in the
              House.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My second experience, as my friend Mr Alban
              Maginness reminded me, was meeting our opposite numbers in Dublin
              to find out how they dealt with the proceeds of serious crime,
              which is a matter of great concern here, as well as in the
              Republic of Ireland. We discovered some interesting facts, and I
              am sure that Members remember some of those. We found that,
              despite its statements about human rights, the Southern Government
              had never signed up to the EU’s civil rights legislation. When
              Mr Maginness and I asked them, with genuine mystery in our minds,
              &quot;How did you get away with that?&quot; They said, &quot;We
              never signed it.&quot;</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is a difference that Members may not think
              it a good idea to emulate. It was all good-hearted and much more
              positive than I am now suggesting it was, because it was
              effective. Never mind the human rights violations, as some might
              call them; this is a team that includes the Inland Revenue, social
              services and the taxation authorities. It is headed by a senior
              officer of the gardaí, and over the past two years it has
              recovered approximately £45 million from people who had taken
              money from the public. The dishonesty and fraudulence had, in many
              ways, resulted in many poor people losing all their money.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My third experience was perhaps even stranger.
              The Committee on Standards and Privileges, which is chaired by my
              good friend Donovan McClelland, invited the Southern Government to
              talk to us about what they did about standards and privileges.
              Since much of the conversation was privileged, it would be remiss
              of me to go into detail. However, I can say that Members will soon
              see a document that will be the product of our Committee on
              Standards and Privileges. It will fully cover all the possible
              temptations that may exist to lure MLAs from the straight and
              narrow path. If we follow that document, we will be all right. The
              Southern Government would have to agree that it is superior to
              what appears in the Oireachtas. I end as I began, by saying long
              live the difference — vive la différence.</p>

              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The debate was interesting, and several points
              that are on the record must be addressed. Mr Alban Maginness said
              that there was a duty on each one of us — through the Belfast
              Agreement — to establish a joint parliamentary body. I want to
              make abundantly clear that the Belfast Agreement has put no duty
              on me whatsoever. I resent the Belfast Agreement, I oppose the
              Belfast Agreement, and I hope that the day will come soon when we
              can bury the Belfast Agreement. I make no apology for the stance
              that I take.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The debate was interesting because what
              developed today was a lovers’ tiff between the SDLP, the Ulster
              Unionists and Sinn Féin — the pro-agreement parties. It was
              interesting that Mr Maginness said that Mr Birnie was delaying the
              process of establishing the joint parliamentary body. Those words
              are interesting, because Mr Maginness’s interpretation was that
              it is a delay, not a desire to stop the process of establishment.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There have been several changes recently
              because of the impending election. Therefore, there may be a delay
              in setting up the joint parliamentary forum because an election is
              in the offing. One thing is said before election time, and another
              is said or done afterwards. That policy is without principle. My
              DUP Colleagues and I are open and honourable enough to tell the
              people where and why we stand on a principled policy. We make no
              apologies whatsoever. The people can make their decision
              accordingly. At least that is an honourable and principled
              position.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since the Member mentioned political honour,
              the fact that his party is still present in this institution —
              and that, indeed, some of its members are Executive Ministers —
              casts doubt on the pristine purity and lack of hypocrisy in his
              party’s position.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr William McCrea:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am delighted that the Member mentioned that,
              because the falsehood and fallacy usually peddled by him and his
              party Colleagues should be buried.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A short time ago, Members stood for the
              Westminster election. The people knew where the DUP stood. They
              knew that DUP Ministers were holding offices in the Assembly,
              which the people gave them. I remember Dr Birnie’s leader waving
              his hands — as he usually does in excitement — and shouting,
              &quot;Why do you not get out? Get out.&quot; He would love the DUP
              to get out of the Assembly. He would love DUP Ministers to leave
              their offices, so that those two ministries could be handed over
              to pro-agreement &quot;suckers for Dublin&quot;.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The DUP is honourable to the electorate. When
              it runs in elections for councils, Westminster and the Assembly,
              the people know where it stands. It will not oscillate, as a
              member of the UUP did in a recent election. If you were
              pro-agreement, he was pro-agreement; if you were anti-agreement,
              he was anti-agreement. That was a totally unprincipled position,
              and it sums up the gobbledygook mindset of Mr Birnie and his
              Colleagues. I am delighted that he mentioned that, because — I
              am sure — he will not come back for a second portion after that
              exposition has been given to him.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today, Members have been listening to
              doubletalk — people saying, &quot;Of course we are not against
              it&quot;, while believing that the situation is sufficient. Let us
              be honest. The current arrangements should be sufficient for them
              because of the North/South Ministerial Council. I am fed up to the
              back teeth — and I know that many of my constituents are too —
              with the Assembly taking up time with ministerial statement after
              ministerial statement. There are more ministerial statements on
              cross-border bodies and cross-border meetings than there are on
              the duties that the Ministers are supposed to carry out. Is that a
              tenable position? It is nothing but total interference in the
              affairs of Northern Ireland, which is resented by the majority of
              people and the Unionist population.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir John Gorman posed a good question. He asked
              how the Dublin Government got away with not signing up to the EU’s
              civil rights legislation. They do it by adopting the policy of
              &quot;Do as we say, not as we do&quot;. They interfere constantly
              in the activities of the police in Northern Ireland. People who
              talk about the police’s use of batons should see how the gardaí
              wield them.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Irish Government interfere in every facet
              of the lives of people here, and this proposal would give them
              even greater opportunity to do so. My time is limited because
              there will be a winding-up speech, but Alban Maginness knows that
              I would be happy to continue the debate with him. His claim that
              the Assembly can make a &quot;critical examination&quot; of the
              North/South Ministerial Council is a joke. There can be no
              critical examination; I wish that there could be so that we could
              see exactly what emerges, because I can tell you — <i>[Interruption].</p>

              suit some people who want to cover things up and who do not want a
              real examination of the nitty-gritty, but I want open government
              whereby people must stand over exactly what they say and do. As
              Unionists, we cannot support the motion.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Alban Maginness said that all Committee members
              have gone to Dublin; that is not true. My Committee has not gone
              to Dublin. The purpose of Committees is to scrutinise Ministers
              here. As Chairperson of the Environment Committee, my duty is to
              scrutinise the work of the Environment Minister, his Department
              and the proposals that he brings before the Committee.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other Members may think that it is more
              important to pay for the Irish language to be printed on a
              Department’s headed paper than it is to fund what really counts,
              for example, the treatment of people waiting for heart operations.
              Public finance is being wasted. Do we need another quango or an
              excuse for another few dinners? Some people would go the length
              and breadth of the world to get a free lunch. The proposed joint
              parliamentary body would be merely a talking shop. We do not need
              more of those; we need democracy in the Province. Unfortunately,
              we are not getting a democratic institution because the
              pro-agreement clique that set up and agreed the Belfast Agreement
              has rigged the situation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I believe in respect. Alban Maginness said that
              good neighbourliness with the South should be developed. That is
              exactly what we want to do, but good neighbourliness is founded on
              mutual respect.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mutual respect means not claiming what is not
              yours. For years, however, the South of Ireland has claimed this
              part of the United Kingdom, and it is interfering daily in our
              affairs. The Irish Government claim that they have removed
              articles 2 and 3, but, under the Belfast Agreement, they do not
              need those provisions. The Belfast Agreement has given them an
              official, more definite position to interfere in every sector of
              the lives of ordinary citizens here — our health, education and
              tourism — and that is 10 times more valuable to them.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many in this Province are sick to the teeth of
              institutions, quangos and little meetings here, there and yonder
              for the sake of it. That is not productive use of ratepayers’
              and taxpayers’ money. We have good neighbourliness with the
              South of Ireland, but it is interesting to note what they do by
              comparison to what we are supposed to do. Mr Ahern says that he
              will not have Sinn Féin in his Government, but he is prepared to
              put it into ours. He has told us that there will be no settlement
              between the United Kingdom and the South of Ireland unless
              terrorist thugs are put into Government. He will not allow them on
              his patch, but he will make us have them on ours.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Good neighbourliness demands self-respect and
              mutual respect. If it is not good enough for him, it is not good
              enough for us. In any case, we should be bosses in our own houses.
              The majority in Northern Ireland should have control of the
              institutions and those who administer them. The people have been
              sold a poisoned pup. Unfortunately for some, but fortunately for
              this country, they will be able to have their say. They can be
              bitten once, but not twice. People are waking up and, with all due
              respect to Mr Ford and his Colleagues, they want no further
              interference pouring from Dublin. Let us rule honourably and

              he highlighted were different from the comments of his Colleague,
              Dr Birnie.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Mr Alban Maginness and Mr McElduff for
              their support. I particularly thank Mr McElduff for saying that
              the motion was not strong enough. It will enhance my street cred
              with the DUP that Sinn Féin was dissatisfied with the motion. I
              was a little worried that it might agree too much with me,
              although some of Mr McElduff’s points about the operation of the
              British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body (BIIPB) were interesting.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Complaints about the operation of the
              North/South Ministerial Council were made recently by Dr McCrea.
              The proposal today is to introduce a little informal North/South
              co-operation on matters of mutual interest and concern in an area
              which is already covered by an east-west body. I agree with the
              DUP’s comments on the inadequacies of the east-west
              institutions. It is clearly the fault of the First Minister and
              the Deputy First Minister that not enough has been done about
              them. That does not mean that we should not examine the
              possibility of North/South links.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Mr Campbell for his words of praise for
              my bona fides, which will undoubtedly enhance my street cred with
              Sinn Féin. Mr Campbell and Dr McCrea disagreed in their approach
              to the issue. My understanding of Mr Campbell’s approach is that
              although the motion, as we proposed it, is acceptable, it cannot
              pass because Republicans will play games with it. I understand Dr
              McCrea to have said that the motion was not at all acceptable. I
              made some notes, and it is clear that Mr Campbell, in several
              times praising the way in which the motion was introduced,
              referred to its precise contents. He is, however, unhappy about
              it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I refer Mr Campbell to the example of his
              colleague, the Mayor of Derry, Cllr Mildred Garfield, who took
              President McAleese around the city of Londonderry. That was a
              practical example of North/South discussion of matters of mutual
              interest. The motion concerns such discussion. It does not concern
              another quango; neither is it a matter of complicating the system
              of Government. It proposes a forum in which people can meet and
              hold simple discussions on matters of interest.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For that reason, I find it particularly
              difficult to accept Dr Birnie’s response. He appeared to allege
              that the motion is incompetent. I assume that I have it on your
              authority, Madam Deputy Speaker, and on the authority of the
              Speaker and the Business Committee which accepted it, that the
              motion is not incompetent. He suggests that the words</p>

              meaningful way? It cannot be done by sitting here. The possible
              benefits of establishing a joint forum can be considered only by
              discussion with the other partner.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Member for giving way. The motion
              proposes the establishment of a joint parliamentary forum. It
              presupposes that the consideration of such a body will reach an
              affirmative conclusion, whereas the agreement specifies that a
              joint parliamentary forum will be considered.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The words &quot;with a view to
              establishing&quot; are clearly used to allow the Members nominated
              by the Speaker of this House and those of the Oireachtas to
              consider the potential benefits of such a body and how it might
              operate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The UUP, with the possible exception of Sir
              John Gorman, intends to end all debate. Did the UUP endorse the
              Belfast Agreement? Is it running scared of the DUP as it
              frequently does on occasions such as this? I see Dr Birnie jumping
              in his seat, but I will not give way again.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I apologise, Madam Deputy Speaker, but Dr
              Birnie looked so enthusiastic. The UUP is running scared from that
              to which it agreed. It is running scared of the DUP and the
              anti-agreement brigade. If the UUP had any sense of what it had
              agreed to four years ago, it would see the motion as a way in
              which practical work could be done and matters of mutual interest
              could be discussed without any constitutional ramifications. It
              would enthusiastically support the motion as opposed to running
              fricht. Having failed to outline what Ministers may have been
              discussing last night, it is clear that the UUP has nothing to
              contribute to the debate. The motion should be passed regardless
              of the fear of Ulster Unionist Members.</p>

              </font></b><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this
              matter in the House.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Down Lisburn Trust area has the highest
              proportion of children and young adults with learning disabilities
              of all the trusts in the Eastern Health and Social Services Board,
              and yet it receives the least funding. Yesterday, I spoke to
              officials from that board, who confirmed that the Down Lisburn
              Trust receives 6% less funding than any other trust.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People with learning disabilities have specific
              needs, and they deserve a service that reflects those needs.
              Identifying and assessing those needs, to assist planning and
              co-ordination of services, is essential. Many needs are not being
              met, and the situation will continue to deteriorate if immediate
              action is not taken. Inadequate funding is the main reason that
              the situation has been created.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many people with learning disabilities depend
              on the service that the Lisburn Assessment and Resource Centre,
              formerly known as the Wallace day centre, provides. Often it is
              their only opportunity for social contact and the security of a
              structured environment that enables them to develop. Current
              provision is not sufficient to meet demand, and as most clients
              make the transition from the education system and need adult care
              support services, this does not bode well for the future.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.45 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The centre caters for 99 people. The conditions
              are absolutely appalling, and it is in need of complete
              refurbishment and extension. Access via the main entrance is
              inadeqate, resulting in clients having to negotiate between moving
              cars and buses to get to it. The front doors are not automatic,
              making it difficult for access to the building by wheelchair
              users, and there is no cover to gain access to transport. In bad
              weather the clients, drivers, and attendants all get soaked. A
              mobile unit is situated away from the main building, and there is
              no protection against the weather when getting from there to the
              centre for meals and therapy. There are too few special needs
              toilets, which means that clients have to queue. On many
              occasions, staff have to use hoists to facilitate clients’
              toilet needs, which is both embarrassing and an insult to their
              dignity.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is so much overcrowding that wheelchairs
              cannot be accommodated in the room catering for people needing
              intensive support. They have to be placed in chairs, and their
              wheelchairs stored in the assembly hall. The effect of this is
              that many people who are wheelchair-bound have no mobility while
              in the centre. The dining facility is also inadequate for the
              numbers attending the centre; many have to eat their lunch in the
              assembly hall. Frozen dinners are sent from Downpatrick, and there
              have been several reports of dissatisfaction with the quality of
              these meals. Assembly hall windows are permanently locked
              resulting in inadequate ventilation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These dreadful conditions are having a serious
              effect on the morale of clients, their families and carers, and,
              above all, the staff. There is no staff room; sickness levels are
              high; and there is no cover for staff on sick leave, unless it is
              for long-term illness. This results in further pressure on staff
              to ensure continuity for these clients by covering the duties of
              their colleagues on sick leave.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Down Lisburn Trust has been operating a policy
              of discontinued service for clients aged over 45 to make way for
              new clients. That has led to much distress, because clients have
              been denied access to friends and their familiar, regular
              routines. It also creates much worry for their carers, many of
              whom are elderly and may be experiencing difficulty in caring for
              their loved ones. The policy is unfair, and contravenes the
              principles of equality espoused in the Good Friday Agreement.
              Under section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998, it amounts to
              age discrimination in the Down Lisburn Trust equality scheme.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given the announcement by the First Minister
              and the Deputy First Minister yesterday that Northern Ireland was
              going ahead of Britain and Europe in extending the protection
              against discrimination to all disabled people in employment, I
              believe that Down Lisburn Trust should reconsider its policy and
              extend the same rights to statutory care for those who are unable
              to work because of the nature of their disability. These people
              already suffer considerable social disadvantage, and they rely on
              others to speak out for them. They deserve a service tailored to
              their needs, and security in the knowledge that the service will
              be continuous, if that is their choice. I believe that the right
              to choose is vital, and that many choices should be available to
              both the disabled and their carers. Facilitation is needed to
              enable them to take control of their lives and to achieve
              independence commensurate with their condition.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The social aspect is also important. Every
              individual is a part of our community, and as such has the right
              to the opportunity to develop a social network within that
              community. We should aim to ensure quality of life for people with
              disabilities and their carers and families. As many options as
              possible should therefore be available to them, thus permitting
              them to take control of their lives rather than being the
              recipients of what others decide should be best for them.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In February, I asked the Minister of Health,
              Social Services and Public Safety what improvements, if any, were
              to be made in the provision of services and facilities at Wallace
              Avenue day centre. The question was AQW 2033/01. The Minister’s
              reply stated that</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;a review of the facilities at Wallace
              Avenue Day Centre is being undertaken by Down Lisburn Trust with a
              view to enhancing the physical environment and developing the
              service provision.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I ask the Minister: what is the timescale for
              the review? When will the report of that evaluation be available,
              and what type of consultation will be undertaken?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Davis:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As many public representatives in the Lisburn
              area have taken a keen interest in the issue, it is possible that
              there could be repetition, but I will carry on regardless.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although the issue has only now been brought to
              the Assembly, many of the area’s representatives, including the
              MP for Lagan Valley, have taken a keen interest in it. I am
              delighted that the topic has been brought to the Assembly, and I
              congratulate Ms Lewsley for that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important to understand that the majority
              of people being cared for at the centre — they are called
              clients — do not have the ability to make choices in their
              lives. They are told what to eat and what to wear. They cannot
              support themselves.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My first point relates to overcrowding at the
              centre. At a meeting held in 1999, a trust representative said
              that the centre was suitable for only 80 people. Today, there are
              approximately 101 people there, and thus the facilities are
              seriously overstretched. It seems that the trust offers part-time
              care — for example, one to two days a week in the centre to some
              clients — in an attempt to get around the problem of
              overcrowding.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are too many people of different
              abilities in the same room. Therefore the behaviour of some
              clients affects others. As a result of overcrowding, there is a
              lack of toilet facilities in the centre, which means that a queue
              system is in operation for people in wheelchairs. Is this really
              suitable?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is worth noting that the dining room is too
              small. The assembly hall must also be used, and there is a
              ventilation problem in the hall. Ms Lewsley mentioned the windows.
              The trust claims that the windows cannot be opened for security
              reasons. I do not see the logic in not having them open for some
              period during the day.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My second point is about the mobile unit at the
              centre. At a recent meeting with people involved in the centre,
              they commented strongly about the condition of that unit. They
              used the term &quot;Third World&quot; to describe it because it is
              over 15 years old. I would have thought that such a deplorable
              environment would not be acceptable today. I suggest that the
              mobile unit be replaced by a permanent structure, which should be
              connected directly with the main section of the building. The
              reason for this is that clients must move between the two separate
              sections in all weather conditions. Some form of corridor or
              protection is badly needed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has also been suggested to me that it can be
              quite hazardous moving from one section to the other during the
              winter, and clients’ safety must be taken into consideration.
              Another safety concern is the main entrance to the building
              itself. Again, a similar situation exists because there is no
              covering for clients and staff when getting on and off the bus.
              Traffic congestion is also an issue because of the size of this
              area and because no automatic doors are provided for easy access
              to the main building.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My third point is about the section of land
              that Down Lisburn Trust wants to sell. The Department has
              commented that its policy is to sell surplus land, but I would
              make the strong argument that this is not surplus land, but rather
              it could be put to good use. For instance, it could be landscaped
              and developed into a garden for clients to enjoy. If this land is
              sold, serious consideration should be given to putting the finance
              obtained into the present accommodation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Even though most of my speech has been
              negative, I will finish on a positive note. It would be wrong and
              highly unfair not to mention the wonderful work of staff at the
              centre. Families of clients have complained to me about the centre’s
              resources and facilities, but they always mention the commitment
              and care shown by staff. They work under tremendous pressure and
              have to deal with the lack of resources. Their hard work must be
              acknowledged and appreciated.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to know how many people work at
              the centre. Figures have been provided, but do they accurately
              reflect the numbers of people who work there? Staff morale must be
              at an all-time low due to the lack of resources and facilities.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My main concerns are: the overcrowding at the
              centre; the mobile unit with its safety issues, and the intention
              of Down Lisburn Trust to sell land at the site.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that the trust and the Minister will pay
              attention to the debate. Resources are overstretched, and that is
              why the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety must
              provide extra funds if we are to tackle these serious issues.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Patricia Lewsley for bringing the
              matter before the House: I know that she has a particular interest
              in disability issues.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The problems with learning disabled, and the
              Wallace Avenue day centre in particular have been ongoing in the
              Lagan Valley constituency for some time. Many of the problems
              outlined reflect the situation accurately. A society is judged by
              how it treats its most vulnerable. The learning disabled are among
              the most vulnerable in our society, and the Down Lisburn area is
              not coming out too well.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not blame the Down Lisburn Trust. It is
              operating on a budget that does not reflect its needs, and that
              must be addressed as a matter of priority. Down Lisburn Trust is
              operating on a budget that — according to the formula of the
              Eastern Health and Social Services Board — is £9·1 million
              less than it should be. The learning disabled in Lisburn receive
              about £1·25 million less than they should. Down Lisburn Trust
              cannot be expected to deliver the resources required when it is
              underfunded by £1·25 million. We could do a vast amount of work
              for the learning disabled in Lisburn if we were given that £1·25
              million.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We do not have enough therapists in the area:
              we cannot get them, and we do not have the resources to get them.
              Alderman Davis mentioned the mobile unit, and there is talk of
              replacing it with another mobile unit. That is not satisfactory,
              and it is not what we need.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need a total review of the facilities in the
              Down Lisburn area, and I will deal specifically with the Lagan
              Valley area. There must be a total review of what is available for
              the learning disabled. The Wallace Avenue day centre, Seymour
              Hill, the Hillhall estate and the Beeches Vocational Training Unit
              should all be reviewed. The review should consider whether what is
              there will meet the needs of the learning disabled in future.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Lisburn covers a vast area, and it is growing
              quickly. Learning disability has no boundaries. The more people
              there are, the more learning disabled there will be. They come
              from all backgrounds and societies and their problems are no
              respecters of money, social class or religious denomination.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Lisburn grows, so the number of people with
              learning difficulties who require facilities will grow. Mr Davis
              has already said that the Wallace day centre is overcrowded. Is
              the centre the right place for those people? Should more money be
              spent on it, or should a new provision be considered — for
              example, a new-build, first-class, twenty-first-century centre for
              people with learning disabilities in the Lisburn area? We must
              take full account of the needs of those with learning disabilities
              and decide on the best way to meet those needs.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will touch briefly on the issue of the
              Beeches vocational training unit. I would have liked the Minister
              for Employment and Learning to be present to answer questions on
              that burning local issue. The European social fund withdrew
              funding from the unit. The Down Lisburn Trust has stepped in to
              ensure that funding continues. However, the Department for
              Employment and Learning has a role to play; it is not simply a
              matter for the Department of Health, Social Services and Public
              Safety. We must consider the training element —</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I remind the Member that the topic of the
              debate is the Wallace day centre and that he should stick to that
              topic.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Poots:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am conscious of the wording of the subject of
              the debate. Some young people who attended the Wallace day centre
              have had to move to the Beeches unit because their families
              thought that the Wallace day centre was sub-standard. Therefore,
              the point that I made about the Beeches unit ties in with the
              subject of the debate because it affects people with learning
              disabilities in the Down Lisburn Trust area. Nevertheless, I will
              not dwell on it, other than to say that the Department for
              Employment and Learning should meet its responsibility and ensure
              that the unit is kept open.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must provide the Wallace day centre with the
              necessary resources to ensure that those with learning
              disabilities in the Down Lisburn Trust area receive the service
              that they deserve. We must consider whether the centre is in the
              right location. If not, we must identify a new site and establish
              where we will find the resources to develop a purpose-built
              centre.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is foolish to suggest that we should sell
              off land on a site that is already overcrowded. That undermines
              the work that is being carried out, because any development on the
              site would be an invasion of the privacy of the young people who
              attend the centre. It would inhibit them and make life more
              awkward for them. That is fundamentally wrong.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Ramsey:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I
              thank Patricia&nbsp;Lewsley for introducing this debate. Like
              Edwin&nbsp;Poots, I am conscious of the wording of the subject of
              the debate. The Committee for Health, Social Services and Public
              Safety, of which I am a member, is aware of the lack of provision
              for adults with learning difficulties throughout the North. Groups
              in the Foyle constituency have lobbied the Committee, and it has
              taken those concerns on board and has also met with other groups.
              As previous Members have said, the issue has come to the fore at
              Lisburn Borough Council meetings not only because of the
              involvement of individuals but because the parent support group
              have brought it to the attention of councillors.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members are aware that the Health Service is
              underfunded by many millions of pounds. Having taken that on
              board, we discover that the so-called Cinderella services that
              deal with mental health, learning disabilities or children seem to
              fall out of the loop. The issue is not emotive; it is specific to
              Wallace day centre’s clients and their families, and therefore
              it does not attract as much media attention as the underfunded
              acute sector. That makes it easier for boards and trusts to skew
              funding from such services.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I accept that Down Lisburn Trust has a funding
              deficit of some £9·1 million, yet it is not perceived as
              underfunded. I am a Lisburn borough councillor, but as an MLA for
              West Belfast, I was more aware of the underfunding of the North
              and West Belfast Health and Social Services Trust. Before the
              inadequacy of Down Lisburn Trust’s funding was highlighted at a
              presentation by the Eastern Health and Social Services Board, I
              would never have believed that its shortfall was so large.
              However, the trust decides how it spends its money, and it is
              easier to skew funds from the so-called Cinderella services.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Wallace day centre provides a valuable service
              to its clients and their families. It is sad that decisions are
              being made without considering the long-term benefits of services.
              I appreciate the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public
              Safety’s attendance today. I hope that she will consider the
              concerns about Wallace day centre and take account of provision
              for adults with learning difficulties in general, including the
              activities of parents in the Foyle Health and Social Services
              Trust area.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Davis and Ms Lewsley outlined the
              difficulties faced by the centre’s staff and by its clients and
              their families. It is a shame that people should have to use or
              work at a centre with facilities more akin to those in developing
              countries. The poor condition of Wallace day centre, which is just
              20 miles up the road, raises the crucial issue of health and
              safety at work. We are asking clients to use those facilities,
              their families to leave them there, and staff to work in the
              centre. Where is the consideration for health and safety?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I commend the commitment of the staff of
              Wallace day centre, its clients and their families for their
              patience and for raising the matter.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall not repeat Members’ excellent points
              in support of centres for people with learning disabilities, in
              particular, Wallace day centre. Mr Poots said that a measure of a
              civilised society was how well it provided and cared for people
              with learning disabilities. Recently, I was moved by a visit to
              the Beeches centre, where I saw how the quality of life and
              self-confidence of those with learning disabilities was improved.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The massive underfunding of Down Lisburn Trust
              must be dealt with, otherwise the shortfall will accumulate. In
              rectifying that underfunding, resources should be redeployed to
              services for adults with learning difficulties. I congratulate Ms
              Lewsley on tabling the matter, and give her my complete support.</p>

              pleased to be here to support the debate. I am grateful to Ms
              Lewsley for raising the issue.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am concerned about the number of people
              leaving Parkview Special School in the next five years. According
              to figures provided by the Minister of Education, 46 pupils will
              be leaving the school, but only 12 pupils have been identified as
              attending the day centre. What will happen to the other 34 pupils?
              For your information, Madam Deputy Speaker, this has a bearing on
              the Wallace day centre. Will 12 more clients be cared for in the
              already overstreched Wallace day centre? Will the clients attend
              the centre daily for the full day? My Lagan Valley Colleague Mr
              Davis and I are tabling questions to the Minister of Health,
              Social Services and Public Safety on that issue. We hope to meet
              with her soon on another matter, but we will take the opportunity
              to raise this issue.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A claim is made in a leaflet outlining the
              facilities and resources available at the Wallace day centre that
              a fully equipped intensive support unit is available. However, I
              know that that is not the case. The intensive support unit is so
              overcrowded that people cannot gain access to it in their
              wheelchairs. Very few facilities are available in the room.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am concerned about the proposed sale of land
              beside the main building. As Mr Davis stressed, overcrowding is
              the main problem. How can the Department of Health, Social
              Services and Public Safety consider selling such land when there
              is a serious case of overcrowding? Would it not be sensible to use
              the land to extend the centre and improve facilities in the
              future?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to pay tribute to the staff at the
              centre. They do an excellent job, and they deserve more
              recognition.</p>

              for Lagan Valley (Ms Lewsley)’s call for enhanced provision of
              facilities for adults with learning difficulties at the Wallace
              day centre in Lisburn. On 7 May I asked the Minister for
              Employment and Learning if she was aware of undercapacity in adult
              centres. I was concerned about the provision for adults with
              learning difficulties in Kilronan Special School in Magherafelt,
              because young people’s parents have been told that they have no
              guarantee of a place at an adult centre and that their sons or
              daughters must leave Kilronan when they are 19. I have been
              granted a meeting with the Minister for Employment and Learning,
              and I will raise various concerns with her.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a problem with insufficient
              accommodation in adult and day centres. An additional tier should
              be provided to cater for those people who are between 18 and 35
              years of age, and I call for intermediate specialised facilities
              for that age group. This is an ideal opportunity for Members to
              represent the interests of those people with learning difficulties
              who are unable to articulate on their own behalf.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many young people come from single-parent
              families, and the removal or non-provision of training can result
              in parents being disadvantaged, perhaps by having to give up their
              employment. The therapeutic value of time out of the home
              environment should not be underestimated, and the advantages for
              the parent and child are immense and well documented.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Throughout Northern Ireland, groups pay
              consideration to disadvantaged groups when dealing with funding
              applications or distribution. There are legal implications, and
              under section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 everyone must be
              treated equally, regardless of any disability. If those legal
              implications apply to society, the House must recognise that they
              also apply to us.</p>

              Member for Lagan Valley, Ms Lewsley, and I emphasise the need for

              two other sites: Dairy Farm in Poleglass and Seymour Hill
              Horticultural Centre in Dunmurry. Fifty-two staff are employed at
              the Wallace Avenue, Poleglass and Dunmurry sites. The services
              provided at the Wallace Avenue facility include day support, arts
              and crafts, education and personal care. The service has close
              links with the Lisburn YMCA and with Stepping Stones, a voluntary
              day support service that can provide greater choice and diversity
              of day support.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are pressures on accommodation. New
              places become available only when the current attendees move to
              new settings as a result of a change in their care needs. The
              Beeches vocational training unit in Aghalee is not mentioned in
              the motion, but the trust and the board have agreed a funding
              arrangement that will ensure continued service provision there for
              this financial year. They are also exploring longer-term financial
              arrangements for that unit with the Department for Employment and
              Learning.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The trust estimates that, between now and 2006,
              40 people will leave local special schools. Of that number, it is
              estimated that 16 will require places at the Lisburn Assessment
              and Resource Centre. The remaining 24 people will need a diverse
              range of placements to meet their individual needs. The trust
              accepts, as we all do, that facilities at the Wallace Avenue
              centre require refurbishment, and the trust is committed to
              getting funding to bring the centre up to standard.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A review of the facilities is under way. Down
              Lisburn Health and Social Services Trust is committed to obtaining
              the necessary funding with which to enhance the physical
              environment of the centre and to develop service provision. The
              trust has assured the parents and carers of those who use the
              centre that there will be full and informed consultation with them
              in relation to any proposed developments.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has been regular contact with the Lisburn
              and district Mencap group in relation to services provided at the
              Wallace Avenue centre. Mencap has been advised of the setting up
              of a joint planning group, comprising all relevant stakeholders,
              to plan future day-support services in the Lisburn area.
              Arrangements for the inaugural meeting of that group are under
              way.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The trust advises that the outline planning
              application that it submitted for the land adjacent to the day
              centre on Wallace Avenue is intended to ascertain whether
              permission would be granted. No proposals have been put to the
              trust board about the sale of the land. That would require full
              consultation with all stakeholders. Such consultation would
              include an equality impact assessment. Down Lisburn Health and
              Social Services Trust has also clearly stated at meetings with
              relevant stakeholders and public representatives that there is no
              threat to the future of the Wallace Avenue centre. That remains
              the case. It is the refurbishment of the centre — the obtaining
              of funding to enhance the physical environment of the centre and
              to develop service provision in the centre — that is being
              discussed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Health, Social Services and
              Public Safety is aware of growing demand for statutory day care
              places, particularly for dependent young people who cannot access
              any other day activities. The Department’s priorities for action
              state that</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Boards and Trusts should continue to
              expand the provision of day care and respite places for people
              with a learning disability&quot;.</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some of the additional funding allocated to the
              four boards to develop community services will be, therefore,
              available for that purpose. Since 1999, an additional £4 million
              has been allocated to the learning disability programme.
              Expenditure in 2000-01 totalled just over £100 million. I await
              the health and social services boards’ health and welfare
              investment plans, which will indicate how each board proposes to
              use additional funding allocated by the Department this year for
              the development of community services. It will then be for each
              board to ensure that the funding of learning disability services
              in its area reflects local need. I will look at the boards’
              investment plans to see how they set out their spending plans in
              each of the programmes of care in their trust area. As employers,
              they are responsible for ensuring that staff work in a safe
              environment and that facilities comply with the relevant health
              and safety legislation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to ensure that people with disabilities
              can be supported to do the same things as their non-disabled
              peers. As other Members have said, that requires access to
              education, training and employment. It means pursuing hobbies,
              leisure activities and sports, and it requires co-operation among
              the relevant service providers in those fields. It requires
              statutory and voluntary sector service providers to work in
              tandem, harnessing their respective expertise for the benefit of
              the individual.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those who need more supportive day care must be
              offered diversity and innovative activities that develop their
              skills and talents. That is the model that health and social
              services are pursuing and will be supporting, and which I expect
              to see reflected in the investment plans that I receive regarding
              how the extra money that is being made available for services in
              the community will be spent. Clearly, as with all aspects of the
              service, there will be pressures. All services provided by boards
              and trusts will need to be looked at in that respect, but it is
              with a view to enhancing the services provided to users.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The development of a model that reflects the
              aspirations of people with learning disabilities, and that
              promotes the inclusive society that the Assembly supports and that
              is reflected in the Executive’s Programme for Government, will
              need additional resources, and that will mean difficult choices in
              the determination of priorities in the 2002-03 spending review. It
              will also mean drawing on the expertise of service users to
              develop and implement strategies. Last week, I was pleased to have
              been asked to launch a report called ‘A Fair Chance’. It is no
              secret that I see promoting equality and tackling social exclusion
              as the cornerstones of responsive and effective health and social
              services.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The needs of people with learning disabilities
              must be seen as a top priority, as they suffer some of the worst
              forms of exclusion from a quality of life that many of us take for
              granted. ‘A Fair Chance’ enables the health and personal
              social services family to improve arrangements for communicating
              with and consulting those with learning disabilities. Therefore,
              the joint planning group that is being established, which will
              comprise all relevant stakeholders, should assist us greatly in
              the task ahead.</p>
