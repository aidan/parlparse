    <p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="1"></a>Speaker&rsquo;s Business</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Standards of Debate</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I want first of all to again draw Members&rsquo; attention to the standard of debate  in the Chamber. I know that certain items of business can give rise to  emotions, and, over the past number of weeks, the Budget Bill has certainly  done that. I have to say as well that quite a number of Members sailed quite  close to the wind with some of their remarks. I remind Members about my ruling  of 24 November 2009, when we moved away from the notion of certain words and  phrases being unparliamentary. The number of Members coming through my door to  ask me to rule on various words that Members had used had become a wee bit  ridiculous. Things had become quite difficult. In places elsewhere, different  words are considered to be unparliamentary, so we moved away from particular  words. It is all about the tone and temper of a debate; that is of more concern  to me as Speaker. Quite a number of Members have made points of order simply to  react to remarks on how other Members might be or are being abused. Of course,  if Members feel very strongly about something said in the cut and thrust of  debate in the Chamber, they have a number of ways, such as interventions or  their own contribution, to take issue with it. We saw that last week with PJ  Bradley, who felt strongly about an issue but was able to bring it up in the  Chamber. I hope that I addressed it in a way with which the Member is  reasonably content.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is not the role of the Speaker to sit in judgement on  disagreements between parties or on differing views of history. We have only  two weeks of the mandate remaining, and I would like to think that we could set  a standard of good temper at the end of this Assembly. That is all I will say  on the issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have an important announcement to make on the Justice  Bill. I wish to advise the House that, when the Justice Bill was referred to me  after Further Consideration Stage last week, it was brought to my attention  that clause 104 of the Bill was not compatible with the EU weapons directive.  Members are aware that a Bill is not competent if it is incompatible with  European Community law. I am sure that it is the will of the House that the  Final Stage should not proceed until the Bill has been amended to ensure that  it is compatible with the weapons directive.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There has been quite a bit of discussion on how we should  deal with the issue. The House has not had to deal with such an issue in the  past. I intend to arrange for the Business Committee to schedule an exceptional  stage of the Bill. We wondered what to call it. These are exceptional  circumstances, and I hope that, when the Business Committee meets tomorrow, it  will refer the Bill to the House to amend clause 104 next Monday 21 March. The  Business Committee will then reschedule the Final Stage and, if Members have  any queries, they should raise them with the Clerks in the Bill Office. These  are complex issues. We dealt with them over the weekend and met this morning,  and we think we have a resolution to the matter.</p>
    <p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="2"></a>Ministerial Statement</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">British-Irish Council: Environment</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I have received notice from the Minister of the Environment that he wishes to  make a statement.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment (Mr Poots)</strong>: I doubt that any issues will arise out of this  item that will cause Mr Speaker to make a ruling in the days thereafter.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In compliance with the requirements of the Northern Ireland  Act 1998, as amended by the Northern Ireland  (St Andrews Agreement) Act 2006, I wish to make the following report on the  eleventh British-Irish Council meeting, held in environmental sector format in Newport, Wales,  on Friday 25 February 2011. The Northern Ireland Executive were represented by  Michelle Gildernew MP, MLA, Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development and  me. This report has been endorsed by Minister Gildernew, and she has agreed  that I should make a statement on behalf of both of us.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The meeting was part of an ongoing series of meetings  within the British-Irish Council since the first summit of 17 December 1999,  which identified the environment as one of the issues for discussion. The  British Government were represented by Lord Henley, the Minister for waste and  recycling, who also chaired the meeting. The Welsh Assembly Government were  represented by Jane Davidson AM, Minister for Environment, Sustainability and  Housing. The Irish Government were represented by Michael Finneran TD, Minister  for housing and local services. Jersey was  represented by Deputy Robert Duhamel, Assistant Minister for Planning and  Environment. Guernsey was represented by  Deputy Peter Sirett, Minister for the Environment Department. The Scottish  Government were represented by their official Dr Stephen Pathirana, head of  Zero Waste Delivery, and the Isle of Man by John Shimmin MHK, Minister for the  Environment, Food and Agriculture.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The British-Irish Council was established under strand  three of the agreement reached in Belfast on Good Friday 1998 as a forum for  its members to exchange information, discuss, consult and use best endeavours  to reach agreement and co-operation on matters of mutual interest within the  competence of the relevant member Administrations.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The meeting focused mainly on waste issues. Ministers  visited Newport Wastesavers, regarded as Wales&rsquo;s  premier community recycling organisation, and Sims Recycling Solutions in Newport, which is part of  the world&rsquo;s largest electronic metals recycling business.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Ministers discussed a wide range of waste-related topics,  including the definition of &ldquo;zero waste&rdquo;; the use of carbon metrics to  calculate waste streams; the use of voluntary initiatives versus regulatory  approaches; how to effect individual behavioural change, recognising that the  financial drivers that motivate business do not apply to individuals; and what  approaches have worked for reducing and managing food waste.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Ministers welcomed the opportunity to exchange ideas and  case studies, and they gave a commitment to work closely together as  Administrations developed their strategies for reducing and managing waste.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Ministers welcomed the news that the Isle   of Man had recently joined the Marine Climate Change Impacts  Partnership. They hailed the shared research vessel activity between Ireland and the UK, which resulted from the  previous meeting, as an exemplar of co-operative working and shared  procurement. Ministers also recognised the contribution that the integrated  coastal zone management subgroup made to the British-Irish Council&rsquo;s work.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Ministers welcomed a written report from the UK Climate  Impacts Programme, which provided an update of its activities since the  previous meeting in July 2010. This outlined the work that the programme did with  four of the Administrations &mdash; Wales,  the Isle of Man, Scotland  and Northern Ireland,  together with some pre-emptive work with Jersey  &mdash; on piloting a set of messages tailored for use in those Administrations that  would help to express the main concepts and issues relating to climate change.  Ministers asked for an update on that at a future meeting.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Ministers noted that the Republic  of Ireland and the Isle   of Man have prepared a joint discussion paper on Sellafield. The UK, which has  government responsibility for Sellafield, has been invited to prepare a  response. Ministers agreed to discuss the paper and to review progress at a  future meeting of the Council.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Ministers agreed that the next ministerial meeting would be  held in Scotland  and that its theme would be biodiversity.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Ministers welcomed the continued close co-operation between  member Administrations on environmental issues. They asked for an update on  waste issues and for climate change adaptation messages to be provided to them  at a future meeting. They also tasked officials to work together on the  development and delivery of a work plan on biodiversity issues.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for the Environment (Mr Boylan)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a  Cheann Comhairle. Thank you, Mr Speaker. On behalf of the Committee, I welcome  the Minister&rsquo;s statement and his indication that the Administrations have been  working together on piloting the key messages that have been expressed on the  main concepts and issues that relate to climate change.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister please tell the House whether he took the  opportunity to discuss with other Administrations the change in policy on the carbon  reduction commitment, which was brought about by the UK coalition Government? What are  the Administrations&rsquo; opinions, if any, of that? Will he also tell the House  what progress he has made to reduce the financial impact of that change on the  North?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: That was not on the agenda. However, I have engaged in  correspondence with the UK Government on the issue, as have my colleagues from Scotland and Wales. We do not see the issue as  closed. The change in the carbon reduction commitment would be a huge detriment  to reducing climate change. It will also be of huge financial detriment to Northern Ireland  and the other devolved Administrations. So, it is something that is worth  fighting about on this occasion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  I thank the Minister and welcome his statement. The statement is a little thin  on details on waste. Will the Minister expand on the other ideas that came up  or what was learned from the meeting? Did he put across the idea of having a  Tidy Northern Ireland day or week, which was the subject of a motion last year,  or of having a special time of the year when we should all clean up our  neighbourhood?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: There was considerable discussion on waste and  particularly, as the meeting was hosted by the Welsh, a zero waste policy and  moving towards zero waste. We have been challenging in some of the targets that  have been set to test whether what other Administrations are doing is right for  Northern Ireland.  For example, Wales and Scotland are  both looking at a 70% recycling target, but that figure includes bottom ash from  incineration regasification units, which could account for 8% or 9%.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In Northern    Ireland, we are heading towards a 60%  recycling target in any event. So, we did quite a bit of testing of where the  policies exist. Some of the differences are down to packaging, for want of a  better word. There is no considerable difference between where any of us are on  the issue. We are all heading towards having less than 10% of our waste going  to landfill, and we are all looking for alternative means of dealing with that  waste. The first way will be to recycle and compost, and the second will be to  derive energy from that waste.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his statement. It is timely that the issue is before us  as we come to the end of the Assembly mandate, if only to concentrate minds in  front of the electorate. The Minister has talked quite a bit about zero waste,  which, presumably, is the same as waste prevention. What are his Department&rsquo;s  ideas on how we can not move away from recycling but put a greater emphasis on  waste prevention in the future?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: The term &ldquo;zero waste&rdquo; refers to zero waste going to  landfill. There will always be materials that can be used in some other way.  Recycling or deriving energy from it is a means of using it. However, the  Member is right that the reduction of waste is the best mechanism to reduce the  pressure on virgin sources such as oil and to reduce the amount of material  that then has to be used in some other way. So, first of all, we have been  engaging with the British Retail Consortium on the packaging policies of the  large supermarkets and others, and we have agreed a Courtauld commitment that  will lead to a reduction in the packaging that consumers will acquire when they  buy goods in the first instance. We are trying to encourage the public to, for  example, deal with the food waste issue and the fact that over &pound;600 in every  household in Northern    Ireland is wasted on food that is not used.  We want to encourage people to buy what they need and to use their money wisely  and help save the environment at the same time. So, yes, we are very focused on  driving down the amount of material that will come into waste streams in the  first instance.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lyttle</strong>: I  also thank the Minister for his statement today. The Minister mentioned the  Marine Climate Change Impacts Partnership. Does he support the introduction of  a marine Bill for Northern    Ireland, and did he take the opportunity to  discuss that matter with his British-Irish Council counterparts?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: Yes, we had a discussion on that issue. Marine issues are  a major element of our biodiversity and, therefore, need to be looked after  correctly. Our marine environment accounts for over 50% of our biodiversity,  and therefore the waters around our shores need to be properly conserved. That  is why we have engaged in a marine plan that applies right across the UK and  why we are setting the motions in place for a marine Bill to be introduced in  the next session of the Assembly. We were never going to be able to introduce  it in this session, given the timescale and the work that was scheduled, but  the Department will wish to introduce a Bill in the next session. The rest of  the UK  will be slightly ahead of us, but that will, perhaps, work out to be a good  thing. When people move ahead, you can sometimes learn from their mistakes, as  opposed to learning from your own. That is always a little easier.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr W Clarke</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I, too, thank the Minister for his statement.  Can he outline how our region compares with the other regions in giving  financial support to local authorities to develop waste infrastructure?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: We did not discuss what other regions are doing. However,  in our region, we have had a number of tranches over the past year of Rethink  Waste, which has been very well received by local authorities, as it has  enabled them to develop some innovative ways of reducing the amount of waste  that goes to landfill. We have been supporting not just local authorities but  community organisations such as Restore, which is run by the City Mission, and  Voluntary Service Lisburn and a range of other facilities around Northern Ireland.  People are collecting old furniture and refurbishing it. It then goes out to  people who need it, sometimes from quite deprived backgrounds. That material  does not go to landfill, and, very often, the people who are engaged in the  restoration are ex-prisoners and people who are being rehabilitated into  society. So, all in all, it is a real win-win-win story to support those  facilities. It is good for the environment, good for people who maybe cannot  afford to buy expensive furniture and good to get people rehabilitated into our  community.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his  statement. My question relates to radioactive waste from Sellafield, which has  been brought into sharp focus by hearing the news of the tragedy in Japan this  morning. It is appropriate that the House extends its sincere and heartfelt  sympathy to that country as it comes through that deep tragedy due to nature.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Ministers noted in the statement that Ireland and the Isle of Man  had prepared a joint discussion paper on Sellafield. That has been in the  melting pot for some time. Will the Minister update us on the progress of that  discussion paper, given its relevance and how it relates to here, especially  the County Down coast? When will the paper be produced with solid  recommendations to be worked through in the various jurisdictions?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: In 2002, the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and  Aquaculture Science carried out a survey of the habits of people who might be  exposed, as a consequence of seafood consumption and aquatic activities, to the  effects of radioactive waste discharged into the Irish Sea from Sellafield &mdash;  that is, those of us who eat fish suppers on a Saturday night. The survey took  place along the Northern    Ireland coast from Belfast Lough to  Carlingford Lough. A critical group of 800 relevant people were interviewed,  and their answers were collated. The information obtained from 2007 indicates  that the dose to the critical group from artificial sources was 15  microsieverts, which is less than 2% of the dose recommended by the  International Commission on Radiological Protection. A typical person in Northern Ireland  receives between 0&middot;05 and 3 microsieverts a year from those activities.  Therefore, it is identified that the risk to people in Northern Ireland  from Sellafield is modest, and that message needs to be put out to the public  so that unnecessary concerns are not raised. Many people have serious concerns  about their family&rsquo;s health that do not need to be exacerbated by something  that may be unfounded.</p>
    <p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="3"></a>Executive Committee Business</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Bill: Final Stage</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  the Environment (Mr Poots)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Bill [NIA  31/09] do now pass.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am delighted that the Bill has, at last, progressed to  Final Stage. The Bill is a worthwhile and positive development. As I said at  Second Stage, it is to be welcomed by all Members of the Assembly, and I am  grateful that that has proved to be the case.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I express my gratitude to the Committee for the Environment  for its broad support for the Bill. Following its detailed and thorough  scrutiny of the clauses and its engagement with a wide range of key  stakeholders, the Committee&rsquo;s constructive and helpful recommendations brought  about some amendments at Consideration Stage that improved and strengthened  what was already a solid and comprehensive Bill. I thank my Executive  colleagues and Members for their ongoing support right from the start of the  consultation process to Final Stage.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Members of the Assembly, Members of Parliament, district  councils, Tidy Northern Ireland, the Northern Ireland Local Government  Association, environmental health officers and other interests have been  calling for the introduction of the Bill for years. It is easy to understand  why so many wanted the Bill to be introduced and why it has been so favourably  received. By providing district councils with an improved suite of powers &mdash; a  proper toolkit &mdash; the Bill will help councils to deal more effectively with a  range of problems that can have a degrading impact on the local environment.  Those problems spoil the appearance of public spaces in towns and cities and in  the countryside across Northern    Ireland. They make the lives of local  residents a misery and cost councils thousands of pounds to clean up. The Bill  should help to reduce street cleansing costs. It is incredible that, last year,  councils spent &pound;34 million on street cleansing; that is around &pound;100,000 a day  on problems such as littering, graffiti, dog fouling, dog control, illegal  fly-posting, abandoned vehicles, nuisance parking, noise, statutory nuisance  and nuisance alleyways. Those directly affect the quality of life for everyone  in our local communities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am satisfied that the Bill, by strengthening and  improving the law, will enable district councils to deal more effectively with  all those problems. The Bill is an important first step in my Department&rsquo;s  clean neighbourhoods agenda, and it will be supported by a comprehensive series  of guidance documents, codes of practice and regulations to help district  councils to get the most out of the new, improved powers at their disposal. The  Bill is large and complex, and it has been thoroughly examined and spoken about  in great detail during its passage to this point. Therefore, I will refer only  briefly to the key provisions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Part 1 gives district councils new powers to deal with  alleyways affected by antisocial behaviour. That will be widely welcomed,  particularly by communities who have been tortured by people engaging in antisocial  behaviour and have had few means of dealing with it. It will also close off  areas at times when that behaviour is taking place and, therefore, give people  a little peace and quiet in their home.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Part 2 gives district councils the power to remove  abandoned cars from the streets immediately.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  All Departments and councils have different methods of dealing with antisocial  activity. We need to start pulling the threads together to ensure that we have  effective legislation and that everybody sings from the same hymn sheet when  dealing with such activity.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: Where councils identify a problem with antisocial  behaviour, they will have the powers to implement the legislation, and, after  consultation with DRD, they will be enabled to do that. I trust that DRD will  be co-operative, and I do not see any reason why it will not be. Councils will  have to develop a case and work with the local police, which will be of  benefit.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In respect of abandoned cars, we created two new offences  to help district councils to deal with nuisance parking. The first is offering  for sale two or more vehicles, and the second is repairing a vehicle on the  road as part of a business.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Part 3 amends the offence of dropping litter in a lake,  pond or watercourse. It gives district councils new litter clearing notice  powers to require businesses and individuals to clear litter from their land,  and it strengthens existing street litter control notice powers for district  councils to require local businesses to help clear up litter that they  generate. It enables district councils to restrict the distribution of flyers,  handouts and pamphlets that can end up as litter. Part 3 also contains  provisions concerning abandoned shopping trolleys, and it gives district  councils the power to recover the costs of dealing with such trolleys from  their owners.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Part 4 enables district councils to serve defacement  removal notices requiring the removal of graffiti and fly-posters. It gives  district councils powers to tackle the sale of spray paint to children and  strengthens the existing legislation which deals with graffiti and illegal  fly-posting.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Part 5 replaces dog by-laws with a new simplified system,  enabling district councils to deal with dog fouling, to ban dogs from  designated areas, to require dogs to be kept on a lead and to restrict the  number of dogs that can be walked by one person.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Part 6 gives district councils powers to deal with audible  intruder alarms and the annoyance that they may cause and powers to impose  fixed penalty fines on licensed premises that ignore warnings to reduce  excessive noise levels.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Part 7 restates and updates the law on statutory nuisances  by bringing it into line with that which already applies in England and Wales.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Part 8 increases the maximum fine on summary conviction  that may be provided for in regulations made under the pollution, prevention  and control provisions in the Environment (Northern Ireland) Order 2002.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Throughout the Bill, greater use is made of fixed penalty  notices as an alternative to prosecution. Stronger, stiffer fines are provided  for in the Bill, and district councils are given the power to retain receipts  from fixed penalty notices. In most cases, they are given the flexibility to  set their own rates.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill should also help to bring about positive benefits  for tourism, reducing antisocial behaviour and making us all think more about the  environment in which we live. The Bill is tangible proof that the Assembly is  determined, through the introduction of stronger legislation and stiffer fines,  to effectively tackle people who continue to degrade the appearance of our  public spaces and our towns, cities and countryside. The Bill will improve  people&rsquo;s quality of life and provide district councils with the necessary  toolkit of powers to make life in Northern Ireland better for all of  its people. I commend the Bill to the Assembly.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">12.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for the Environment (Mr Boylan)</strong>: Ar son an Choiste  Comhshaoil, cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh Ch&eacute;im Deiridh den Bhille um Chomharsanachta&iacute;  Glana agus an Timpeallacht.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On behalf of the Committee for the Environment, I welcome  the Final Stage of the Clean Neighbour&shy;hoods and Environment Bill and, once  again, thank the Minister of the Environment and his departmental officials for  the close working relationship that we maintained throughout the Bill&rsquo;s  passage, which helped to ensure that the Committee scrutinised it thoroughly  and was able to reach agreement with the Department on proposed amendments. I  also want to take the opportunity to thank the Committee staff, who have worked  hard on the legislation. The Committee has dealt with a lot of legislation  during the mandate. With the staff&rsquo;s help, we have been able to turn around all  Bills in a timely manner.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Bill will,  undoubtedly, contribute to an improvement in local communities. I remind  Members that, following detailed scrutiny of the Bill, the Committee made eight  recommendations. The Minister incorporated three of those as amendments, which  related to fixed penalty notices to children; raising the age limit under which  it should be an offence to sell aerosol paints; and the expansion of the  definition of &ldquo;owner&rdquo;. The Committee also took the advice of the Examiner of  Statutory Rules on the Department&rsquo;s powers to alter the amount of a fixed  penalty and made recommendations, which were accepted by the Department, that  any changes were subject to draft affirmative procedure. It is important that  the House has the highest level of scrutiny when it comes to changes. Those  amendments will ensure that that occurs.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I believe that the Committee&rsquo;s recommendations and the  subsequent amendments have enhanced the Bill, which should bring about real  improvement in people&rsquo;s lives by allowing local councils to tackle problems,  such as graffiti, litter, nuisance alleys, fly posting and abandoned cars. On behalf  of the Committee, I am, therefore, pleased to support the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">With your indulgence, Mr Speaker, I would like to say a few  words on behalf of Sinn F&eacute;in. My party certainly welcomes this legislation. Key  to all of it will be its roll-out and implementation on the ground. I hope that  it will be properly implemented by local councils that get that authority. It  should benefit local communities. My colleague will say a few more words on  behalf of Sinn F&eacute;in.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On the Committee&rsquo;s behalf, I welcome this piece of work.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  I thank the Minister, Department, staff and everyone who has been involved in  the Bill. It has been an extremely good example of people&rsquo;s working together  that we could learn from with regard to other matters that go through the  Chamber.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As someone who has been a councillor, I know &mdash; I am sure  that most Members will agree &mdash; that matters that are dealt with in the Bill are  the most frustrating that councils have to deal with constantly, yet have never  had the power to do so, whether that be dog mess, litter, vehicles, graffiti,  noise or any other matter that has already been touched on. We all welcome the  Bill and everything that it will put in place; particularly, the raising of  penalties where possible. The Bill links in with other legislation that is  coming through.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am pleased to hear the Minister speaking about his  guidelines and codes of practice. We look forward to seeing those come through  and matters being dealt with by councils as quickly as possible. There is still  concern about the costs for councils and their need for resources; for example,  for legal guidance on how to actually deal with a fixed penalty notice. Councils  will be grateful to get funds from fixed penalties. However, as many of us know  from dealing with matters in the past, often, when something goes to court, it  costs the council a great deal more than the actual fine. Therefore, I hope  that those codes of practice and guidelines will help councils and that we will  keep one eye on what resources councils need, so that they can implement the  legislation as soon as they can. I very much support the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for the  conclusion of the Bill. Those of us who saw it through the Committee were  deeply engaged with it. As the Chairperson said, it is important that we have  seen amendments to the Bill, which will, hopefully, bring about real  improvement in people&rsquo;s lives by allowing councils to tackle problems, such as  graffiti, litter, nuisance alleys, fly posting and abandoned cars. In the  middle of all that, the Bill has the potential to contribute, in a real and  meaningful way, to the reduction of antisocial behaviour; to better and,  indeed, more stable communities; to, in many ways, better visual appearance of  some towns, villages and cities; and to better communities as a whole. That can  be only a good thing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to be brief, because it has all been said. However,  this is a key point: political, civil, community and local involvement through  leadership and role models will be required to ensure that the legislation is  successful. The facility is there and the legislation and the outlet for it  will be there, but leadership will be required to ensure that it happens.  Hopefully, we as elected representatives in our areas will be doing what we can  to work with the councils, communities and individuals to ensure that this  enhancement of our society does happen.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, I thank the Minister and his Department for  bringing the legislation to conclusion and fruition in the House today. I  especially want to put on record my tribute to the staff of the Environment  Committee. As Members know, Departments have a lot of resources, but there are  only four people in a Committee office. That Committee office has proved  formidable in its support in ensuring that members were kept fully up to date  and that legislation, not only this Bill, but the whole package of legislation,  some of which was very heavy, was seen through the Assembly.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lyttle</strong>: I  join my Assembly colleagues in welcoming the Final Stage of the Clean  Neighbourhoods and Environment Bill. I agree that it will lead to tangible  improvements in the quality of life of local people. I commend the Minister and  his Department, the Committee and Committee staff for their hard work in  introducing the legislation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My local council&rsquo;s cleansing teams and environmental health  officers have sought the powers that have been created by the legislation for  some time. They will now be able to tackle more effectively the local issues  that have been mentioned. Those issues include littering, graffiti, unkempt  gardens and the perennial difficult issue of fly-posting. Such practices spoil  the amenity of our local neighbourhoods, and they often lead to even more  serious criminal damage. So, I wholeheartedly welcome the Bill, and I look  forward to the improvements that it will allow council officers to make to  local communities.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr W Clarke</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I welcome the Final Stage of the  Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Bill, and I thank everyone who was  involved in the legislation, particularly the Committee staff.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill looks to address many issues, including antisocial  behaviour, dog fowling, noise abatement and graffiti. It is an important Bill  that will affect people&rsquo;s quality of life, and, as the Minister said, deals  with issues pertaining to the environment. It will also make a real difference  to people&rsquo;s lives. That is what the House is for: to make good legislation that  will have a big impact on people&rsquo;s lives.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will talk briefly on aspects of the Bill that some groups  expressed concern about. As I said at Second Stage, there was considerable  opposition to fixed penalty notices for children and young people. That concern  came from many groups who were representing that section of the community. I am  also concerned about fixed penalty notices for 10 to 11-year-olds. The  Department has acknowledged that concern, and it will issue guidance that will  be consulted on. Some groups stated that young people were not consulted enough  on such measures as gating orders, in particular.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the legislation. It is another useful tool in  councils&rsquo; toolboxes with which to deal with antisocial behaviour, but the  gating of alleyways at the backs of people&rsquo;s houses will have to a last resort.  Children&rsquo;s organisations also raised that concern. Those organisations also  said that there had to be greater supervision of children, better consultation  with children and better engagement with children in schools. They also said  that there had to be recognition of the fact that other social issues were the cause  of young people gathering at other people&rsquo;s houses. That has to be dealt with.  Fra McCann touched on that in his intervention.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A multi-faceted approach has to be taken to deal with any  issues of antisocial behaviour or to address why young children as young as 10  or 11 are loitering at the back of people&rsquo;s homes at midnight or 1.00 am. There  are serious issues there that need to be addressed. It is about more than just  putting up a gate, because that will just push the problem elsewhere. The young  person will then be vulnerable in another location.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In developing good policy for gating orders, it is  important that councils factor in those issues, because they are impacting on  all our communities. We see it in our communities daily. We need to ensure that  the resources are put in place to deal with young children who are very  vulnerable.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, we need to keep the legislation under  constant review and continue to monitor how well it is working and how well  councils are adopting it. There is no point in having the legislation in place  if councils are not rolling it out. I support the Bill&rsquo;s Final Stage. Go raibh  maith agat.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Savage</strong>: I  also welcome the Bill&rsquo;s Final Stage. I know that a wealth of knowledge and  expertise has been put into the Bill, and I wish to associate myself with the  remarks made about all the staff in the background for the amount of work that  they have done in bringing the Bill to its Final Stage.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The bulk of our council staff will be glad to see the Bill  passed, because, at present, a lot of our staff really have no teeth to do  anything. The Minister summed it up well today when he said that, at last, this  is the necessary toolkit that council officers will receive to carry out those  works. That is a very important phrase, which council staff right across Northern Ireland  will welcome.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I know that many issues have been raised concerning young  people and waste. Let me tell you something, Mr Deputy Speaker: the young  people do not need to be blamed for all of that, because we have to educate the  older people to adapt to change. The days are passed when people can open a car  window and flick out whatever they want to flick out.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Two or three weeks ago, when I was out on another mission,  I saw young people coming out of some place where they were getting something  to eat. They had waste, but they were looking for bins in which to put their  waste. It is up to councils now to provide the proper facilities to enable our  streets to be kept clean. It is a learning process for a lot of people. In  closing, our council officers and staff welcome the Bill. It will give them  teeth and, as the Minister said, it will give them the toolkit to carry out  their work.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I thank Members for their contributions and their support  throughout the process. As lawmakers, we are doing something that I believe  will improve the quality of people&rsquo;s lives, but, as the old saying goes, you  can lead a horse to water, but you cannot make it drink. We need the public to  come with us to make Northern    Ireland a cleaner place, a better place to  live and somewhere where the quality of life is enhanced through looking after  our environment in a much better, more structured way.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank my own staff and the Committee staff for their work  in the process, and I commend the Bill to the Assembly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">That the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Bill  [NIA 31/09] do now pass.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I ask Members to take their ease for a few moments, because  business has moved faster than we expected. I see that the Minister for Social  Development has now arrived.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">12.45 pm</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading"><a name="4"></a>Housing (Amendment) Bill: Final Stage</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development &nbsp;(Mr Attwood)</strong>: I  beg to move</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">That the Housing (Amendment) Bill [NIA 32/09] do now  pass.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Before I give a brief summary of what is in the Bill, I  will make a number of opening comments. I want to acknowledge the work of a lot  of people, the first group being those who work in the Office of the  Legislative Counsel (OLC). Over the past short period, there have been a number  of amendments to the original Bill and further drafting has been required.  Between six and nine months ago, it was said to me that, because of the demands  of other Bills and legislation going through the Assembly, the OLC was  significantly stretched in its capacity to deal with other business. Through  this Bill and other Bills from the Department for Social Development (DSD) and  other Departments, the OLC has shown that it is able to turn over a large  volume of work. That gives rise to a wider point, which is whether we would have  sufficient capacity in the drafting side of the Assembly to turn over all the  Bills that require drafting, redrafting, amending and re-amending were the  Assembly to fully stretch its legislative function in the next mandate.  Although the OLC does great work, I would question whether that work needs to  be enhanced to ensure that the Assembly is fit, ready and able to complete all  the legislation that is expected in the next mandate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also want to acknowledge the work of the Bill Office,  which, apart from the drafting side of its work, provides a liaison between the  draftsmen and Members and Departments. The Bill Office has also been  overwhelmed with the burden of work over the past period, given the scale of  legislation that has been tabled, particularly since the autumn.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also want to acknowledge my own officials. As I said  previously about this and other Bills, whatever the political direction from  the Minister and whatever assistance is given by the OLC and others, a lot of  the hard work and heavy lifting is undertaken by officials. My strong sense  from the work on this and other Bills is that there is a good body of officials  in DSD who work to resolve problems.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Before dealing with some of the substance of the Bill, I  want to make a much broader point. The Assembly has rightly begun to address a  matter that is much more substantial than it may previously have been: welfare  reform and welfare cuts. A lot of that is coming across from Westminster as  regards the impact that there will be on housing benefit, entitlement to  housing benefit, housing benefit levels and the whole architecture and process  around housing benefit. One of the areas in which we have not necessarily  interrogated all that is being proposed on housing benefit is the  private-rented sector. In going forward, the issues of housing, housing  benefit, housing benefit reductions and their impact on that sector is one that  must be more fully interrogated. This weekend, officials provided me with a  submission and a draft letter to Lord Freud that scoped out all the issues on  how housing benefit adjustments, changes and cuts will impact on the growing  number of people who rely on the private rented sector.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  That is an important point. In Committee, the Minister said that he had raised  issues with Lord Freud and others. However, another aspect of the private  rented sector hurts many people. Over and above housing benefit or local  housing allowance payments, landlords use top-up, which maybe costs people,  many of whom are already being paid at poverty level, more than &pound;100 on top of  their benefits. Will that issue be taken into consideration?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: Very much so. In the draft letter that I signed off on  over the weekend, that issue was named specifically as needing consideration.  There is evidence that the practice of top-up is significant in the Northern  Ireland housing market, and, given the number of people on welfare, low pay or  coming out of work, top-up will impact more and more significantly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The wider point arising from Mr McCann&rsquo;s question concerns  the fact that we may be unable to build the number of properties that we have  built in the past year or two in particular, but in the past five years in  general. At the same time, there will be an increasing demand for private  rented properties because, on the one hand, we may be unable to deal with the  level of housing stress and need, and, on the other hand, people risk losing  their property because of mortgage debt and repossession. The need to monitor  more tightly, if not regulate, the private rented sector on top-ups as well as  housing benefit changes and cuts as they impact on that sector is a crucial  part of the narrative of DSD, the Housing Executive and the Assembly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although we are at the Final Stage of the Bill, it is not  the final stage of the work that needs to be done. Over and above whatever  further legislative intervention may be needed for the private rented sector,  there will be &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: Yes, I will.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  That is all interesting stuff. We were canvassing recently in west Belfast and noticed that  a huge number of private rented sector houses are lying empty. In Committee, we  raised the question of the standard of houses in the private rented sector,  which are let to the minimum standards expected. If a decision is taken about  increasing the use of houses in the private rented sector, the standards should  be raised to, say, the decent homes standard.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank the Member for that intervention, which gives  rise to a number of points. As I said at Further Consideration Stage, the  Department is already well advanced in drafting proposals on private rented  sector fitness standards, which will hopefully become law. Those standards will  include issues such as energy efficiency, which relates to decent homes  standards.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Legislation is being proposed to make properties that are  not rented out still liable for rates to try to create discipline or a penalty  for landlords who do not bring properties back into the rented sector. There is  not a licence to own property without having the responsibility of putting it  on the market.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also take the Member&rsquo;s point about voids. The Housing  Executive drilled down on the issue of its voids because exaggerated figures  existed about the number of properties that were or were not occupied. A much  more realistic figure is now in circulation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My final point on those matters is that the private rented  sector, whether on the law side or the housing benefit and wider management  side, needs to be addressed and carefully monitored. Given the potential loss  of people&rsquo;s homes and the fact that the reduction in the number of newbuild  houses over the next four or five years will increase levels of housing stress,  we need to be vigilant to ensure that we respond as quickly as possible to the  increasing number of people who will rely on the private rented sector.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill will enable the improved regulation of the private  rented sector, introduce new tools to tackle fuel poverty, promote effective  housing management and clarify existing housing law in a number of ways. The  main focus of the Bill is on improving the regulation of the private rented  sector, which has grown dramatically in recent years and now forms almost 20%  of all housing stock. The provisions relating to privately rented housing will  offer further safeguards to tenants and will help upgrade standards in what is  becoming a modern, vibrant, private rented sector. The Bill will enable my  Department to make subordinate legislation, create schemes for the mandatory  registration of landlords and safeguard deposits paid by tenants. Those are two  key steps forward.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill will also improve the effectiveness of existing  measures for regulating the private rented sector and improve the security of  tenure of long-term tenants by extending the notice-to-quit period. A lack of  information on the identity and location of private landlords currently makes  compliance and enforcement activity difficult for councils. The Bill will,  therefore, place a duty on the Housing Executive and the Department of Finance  and Personnel (DFP) to share information on housing benefit and rates where  that is necessary to support the enforcement of private rented sector  legislation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill will ensure that the current system of regulation  of houses in multiple occupation (HMO) continues to operate effectively in  promoting the interests of tenants. Taken together, all those proposals, which  include tough financial penalties for non-compliance, will, we trust, drive up  standards and significantly improve protection for tenants in the private  rented sector.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill will also provide social housing landlords with  new tools to address antisocial behaviour and enhance community safety. In  particular, the Bill will enable all social landlords to access the information  that they need to make key decisions about tenants with a history of antisocial  behaviour, and it will allow landlords to withhold consent in exchanges  involving such tenants. Importantly, the Bill will also encourage consistent  decision-making by the courts in cases where a social landlord seeks possession  because of antisocial behaviour.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Today, l launched a new fuel poverty strategy, and the Bill  supports that strategy by introducing important new powers for the Housing  Executive to broker energy at a discounted price for its tenants. That gives  the Housing Executive the ability to negotiate with energy suppliers on behalf  of at least 90,000 tenants, who represent a large and attractive share of the  domestic energy market. The scheme, which the Housing Executive will put out to  tender shortly, will, I trust, not just be for the 90,000 Housing Executive  tenants. Housing associations, which have been somewhat slow in using their  current powers for energy brokering, will be able to piggyback on the Housing  Executive&rsquo;s scheme in an effort, I trust, to ensure that any discount negotiated  with energy suppliers applies to the biggest number of tenants, be that in the  Housing Executive or the housing association sector.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Once the law is passed, we will receive Royal Assent within  the next six to eight weeks. In parallel with that, the Housing Executive has  been working up a tender to go to market, which will have to comply with  European procurement practice. If the process is successful, the Housing Executive  will have an energy brokering scheme in place by late summer.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In taking forward the energy brokering part of the fuel  poverty strategy that was announced today, I acknowledge the assistance  provided by former Congressman Joe Kennedy, who is the chief executive officer  of Citizens Energy Corporation that works out of Boston  and supplies discounted fuel to more than 20,000 homes covering 16 states in North America.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Joe Kennedy introduced that model in 1979, when he  went to Latin American countries, bought fuel directly from the producer,  imported that into Boston and then sold it to those in need at 42% below the  market rate. I want to acknowledge his endorsement of the strategy that we have  taken forward over the past period of time. I trust that that strategy will  mature over the next six months to the point where as many tenants as possible  in the housing association and Housing Executive sectors have the capacity,  through the Housing Executive, to get fuels at a discounted rate that surpasses  the discounts available in even the private domestic market at present.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">1.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In my view, the issue of energy brokering, which this Bill  gives the Housing Executive the authority to take forward, should extend, if at  all possible, to the use of oil. It is the case that BP imports 70% of the oil  that is used in domestic homes in Northern   Ireland and that 70% of people in Northern Ireland  continue to use oil for their domestic heating. Given those two facts, it seems  that there is an obligation on oil importers and on BP more than anyone else to  begin to acknowledge the level of fuel poverty in Northern Ireland and the potential  for energy brokering, on either a one-by-one or broader basis, to reduce the  cost of fuel for domestic homes. That is why I met the director of UK sales at BP  last week, although there was some resistance to that meeting in the first  instance. He has agreed to go back to senior management to discuss the broader  issue of the responsibility on oil importers and on BP in particular to help  deal with fuel poverty given the scale of that in Northern Ireland today, as outlined  in the strategy. If there is anything further on that matter before I end my  tenure as Minister, I will certainly report back to Members.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill will also give councils powers to improve energy  efficiency in residential accommodation in their districts. That complements  the work being undertaken by my Department and the Housing Executive through  the Home Energy Conservation Authority for Northern Ireland. I commend the  Bill to the House.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee for Social Development (Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n)</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. With your indulgence, I would like to  make a few general remarks as Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for Social  Development before addressing the content of the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As Members are aware, the Committee for Social Development  carefully and seriously considered the provisions of the Housing (Amendment)  Bill. The Committee&rsquo;s Bill report, which informed deliberations at  Consideration Stage, was the sixth such report of this mandate. This is the  last Final Stage of primary legislation that the Committee considered in this  mandate. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the members of the  Social Development Committee for their contributions at Committee Stage. I  would also like to thank the witnesses for their useful written and oral  submissions and the departmental officials who, as usual, provided a fast  turnaround on some very detailed Committee enquires. I would also like to thank  the Social Development Committee staff who facilitated formal evidence-taking,  the Bill&rsquo;s clause-by-clause scrutiny and the production of the Bill report.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee&rsquo;s legislative programme was perhaps the  second or third biggest of all the statutory Committees, and Mr Deputy Speaker,  I trust that you will agree that the Committee has, indeed, discharged its  responsibilities in respect of the legislation with diligence, care, occasional  good humour and professionalism.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A LeasCheann Comhairle, as you are aware, much of the  legislation considered by the Committee in this mandate related to tenancy and  housing issues. In the case of the Housing (Amendment) Bill and as the Minister  previously outlined, the Committee made a very obvious and significant  contribution to the development and passage of the Bill. During Committee Stage,  members suggested a large number of changes, most of which were subsequently approved  by the Assembly at Consideration Stage.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Members welcomed insertions and amendments to the Bill that  will improve tenure security for long-term tenants in the private rented  sector. They felt that such a measure was a timely recognition of the changing  patterns in housing choices and of the growing use of the private rented  sector.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Members were happy to see a firm commitment to and a  timetable for the introduction of a tenancy deposit scheme and a landlord  registration scheme. As the Minister outlined, those two important schemes are  seen as a key step in the enforcement of tenancy legislation. The Committee  hoped that, when the related regulations come forward, they will limit the  bureaucratic burden on good landlords and facilitate the identification and  improvement of bad landlords.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee considered evidence from local government  that highlighted the problems that councils have and the costs that they incur  when pursuing bad landlords through the courts. The Committee welcomed the  introduction of information sharing obligations and fixed penalties for  breaches of tenancy legislation. Members hope that those penalties will  generate some additional resources for councils, while deterring those who  flout tenancy legislation. As I said at Consideration Stage, it is anticipated  that, in the next mandate, the Committee will review the effectiveness of those  penalties, as well as the other fines that are in the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A key part of the Bill is the extension of measures that  relate to the control of antisocial behaviour. The Committee contended that  exchanges of social tenancies have, wrongly, been used in the past to resolve  antisocial behaviour issues. The Committee was very clear that it wanted to  support communities that are blighted by the antisocial actions of a few  individuals and families. Therefore, the Committee was pleased to see the  inclusion at Consideration Stage of additional grounds under which social  landlords can withhold agreement to the exchange of tenancies.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill also includes provisions relating to the  disclosure of antisocial behaviour information. The Committee felt that those  provisions are proportionate and fair and would allow for joined-up actions to  control any antisocial behaviour that is associated with social tenancies.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">For similar reasons, the Committee welcomed provisions that  relate to the development of guidance for the courts on possession orders.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Housing (Amendment) Bill, as amended at Consideration  Stage, contains many other measures, such as those that relate to the  activities of the Housing Executive. The Committee was happy to support those  elements of the Bill in so far as they lead to an improved service for tenants  and to the more efficient management of social housing here.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Let me make it clear, a LeasCheann Comhairle, that I am now  speaking as an MLA; I will depart as Deputy Chairperson.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Despite its good work and a general sense of common purpose  throughout the Committee, there are issues on which Sinn F&eacute;in would have liked  to see the Minister take a more robust approach, namely, the registration of  private landlords. As it sits in the Bill, that provision takes a light-touch  approach. Our concerns on that and other issues are well documented, and I have  no doubt that Fra McCann will go into some of those in detail.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is safe to say that there will be another Housing Bill  for the new mandate and the new Social Development Committee to consider.  However, it is my view that any new Housing Bill would need to take a  completely new approach to tackling the housing waiting list. It would need to  consider the possibility that we will adopt our own selection scheme and  seriously attack the legacies of inequality that prevail in housing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is well known and on public record that my constituency  has one of the worst housing waiting lists. Rather than confront that head-on  in the Bill, or by any other legislative path, both Ministers for Social  Development chose to ignore that, despite the increasing inequality, by  removing protections for people on the housing waiting list. Some of those  people are in north Belfast, west Belfast and, indeed, Derry  city. I urge any incoming Social Development Committee, and any new Bill that  may come in the next mandate, to look at selection schemes, ring fencing and  equality proofing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank all members of the Social Development Committee,  who have steadfastly and consistently contributed to the passage of the Housing  (Amendment) Bill.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  As has been said, the private rented sector has experienced rapid changes over  the past 20 years. It has been difficult even for government to keep up with  those changes, which is why I welcome the Bill. I acknowledge the very good  work that my colleague the Social Development Minister has done to bring it to  this stage. I also commend all the staff who were involved in the underlying  work.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill will bring a sense of security to people who rent  in the private sector. It also includes a range of protections for those in  social housing who suffer from difficulties such as antisocial behaviour or  fuel poverty. Antisocial behaviour makes life miserable for many of the good  tenants. The improvements to its management, under the new arrangement, are  most welcome. For too long, the solution has been to move the problem elsewhere  and transfer the tenants who engage in antisocial behaviour to somewhere else.  Rather than curtailing the problem, that approach has often allowed it to  spread and escalate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There have also been cases of abuse by landlords in the  private rented sector. The system was open to that kind of abuse, but such  practices are now being brought to an end. The curtailment of those undesirable  landlord practices can only be good for tenants and, indeed, the vast majority  of landlords.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am fairly sure that the cost of energy is a topic that  comes up on a daily basis in most households. The new powers contained in the  Bill will allow the Housing Executive to broker energy for its tenants at  discounted rates. That is a major step forward in the era in which we are  living. About 57% of Housing Executive tenants live in fuel poverty. As the  Minister said, given that there are about 12,000 homes in the social housing  stock, there is huge potential for savings. The benefits of that measure will  undoubtedly be widely welcomed. Those benefits will be passed on to tenants.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill is about the reform of the private rented sector.  It is the first major reform in a very long time and will be welcomed by  everyone.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: Like  others, I support the Bill. I also thank all the staff and stakeholders who  assisted the Committee in its clause-by-clause scrutiny. As others have said,  it is a very important Bill. It brings forward a number of very beneficial  changes to social housing and the private rented sector in Northern Ireland.  I particularly welcome the mandatory landlord registration and tenant deposit  schemes.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Given the plan to build less social housing in the next  four years, as contained in the new Budget, the waiting list for social  housing, which is currently 38,000 strong, will get longer and longer. The  number of tenants in the private rented sector is, obviously, going to  increase, as young people in particular are not able to borrow money from  mortgage companies and banks to buy their own homes. The private rented sector  will grow over the next few years. It is, therefore, timely and very important  that that sector will be better regulated by the Bill.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">1.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The provisions for the prevention of the spread of  antisocial behaviour in social housing are very important. As we all know as  MLAs, very many people are affected by the blight of antisocial behaviour in  their neighbourhoods. Indeed, whole neighbourhoods can be blighted by a small  number of people who engage in antisocial behaviour, day and night. It is  important that we prevent tenancy exchanges by antisocial tenants whereby we  simply allow them to move from one area to the next. That rewards bad behaviour  rather than tackling it on the spot and punishing it, and it means that  law-abiding neighbours, who want peace and quiet but stay in the area, and who  suffer day and night, eventually can find no other way than to move out and  find somewhere else to live. I applaud the inclusion of those provisions in the  Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also welcome the provisions relating to energy brokering.  I commend the Minister for Social Development for all his efforts in amending  the Bill and for engaging with the energy companies to explore ways and means  of helping with energy brokering. People in Northern   Ireland pay more for fuel than people in other parts of  the UK  but have a lower average income, which means that a significant proportion of  people here, approximately 40% of the population, suffer from fuel poverty. A  large majority of people in social housing are living under the strain of  increasing fuel costs. That is shameful. It is important that the Bill endeavours  to help those people to meet the increasing cost of fuel and allows us to  broker some form of leverage that will help them with their finances.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">All in all, I welcome the Bill and I am delighted that it  has reached Final Stage.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle agus a chairde. Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh  an Bhille seo inniu. I welcome the passage of the Bill. The Sinn F&eacute;in members  of the Committee for Social Development argued that the Bill did not go far  enough on a number of issues. The lowering of the Bill&rsquo;s status from that of a  full Bill to an enabling Bill concerned us. Some issues that would have been  dealt with in the original Bill have been removed, although we have been  assured by the Department that those issues will be picked up when any new  legislation comes to the Committee in the new Assembly. We accepted the  Department&rsquo;s assurances that much of what is in the Bill might have been lost  had we not gone with the Bill as it stood.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in members of the Committee for Social Development  wish to thank the departmental officials who gave evidence and guidance. We  also thank Peter McCallion and the Committee staff for their hard work and  guidance throughout the many meetings that we had in order to deal with the  Bill, as well as Simon Hamilton, Chairperson of the Committee, for the helpful  way in which he chaired meetings and allowed debate to flow.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is true to say that the highlight of the Bill is the  issue of the private rented sector. The mandatory registration of that sector  is crucial for the protection of the many thousands of people who live in it.  The sector now provides more houses to the market than the Housing Executive  and housing associations combined. Until now, that sector has been totally  unregulated, even though it draws down payments of almost &pound;100 million a year  in housing benefit. That would not be tolerated in any other sector; for  example, the community sector is frequently audited for small amounts of money.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">During this term, Sinn F&eacute;in has brought two separate motions  to the House to try to deal with registration in the private rented sector. The  first was supported unanimously; the second was not. However, we set out our  stall at the time. As a party, we wish to secure stricter controls over the  private rented sector, especially in the form of mandatory registration and  compliance regulations. We are glad that those are contained in the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We had reservations about some areas of the Bill in which  we believed that additional protection should have been given to people, and  some of those points came up during evidence given to the Committee. Those  included ensuring that a private rented sector house meets the decent homes  standard before it can be rented and the compilation of a register of houses in  the private rented sector that meet the lifetime homes standard. That would  have allowed people with disabilities to identify properties suitable to their  needs.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We refrained from tabling amendments on those issues for  fear that they would not have gained the support of the Committee or the  Assembly at Consideration Stage, and we were concerned that any delay could  endanger the passage of the Bill owing to the heavy workload that the Assembly  faces in the remaining weeks. However, it is certainly something we can come  back to if we are re-elected.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Landlords withholding deposits was dealt with in clause 2.  Again, that is an important issue and had to be legislated for, given the  record of many landlords. Even this week, I have dealt with people who have had  deposits withheld and are having to stay with friends or relatives because they  cannot afford the deposit for a new rental property. Many people whom I have  dealt with accept that a deposit will be withheld, and accept that as the norm.  They say that many landlords will find any excuse to hold back tenants&rsquo;  deposits. The vast majority of tenants do not even complain about the practice.  I have dealt with many people who have ended up in debt and cannot be housed  because they cannot afford another deposit, which can sometimes reach up to  &pound;1,000. A proper mediation procedure needs to be put in place to investigate  any breaches of tenancy that may warrant the deposit being withheld by the  landlord. That measure would provide protection for the landlord and the  tenant.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We also argued for strong compliance regulations, such as  heavy fines to be given to landlords who do not comply with registration. If we  look at the registration scheme for houses in multiple occupation, we see a  sector that has been abused by some landlords who provide substandard,  overcrowded accommodation. Some of them, when brought to court, were rewarded  by being given a mere &pound;100 fine. Clause 8 proposes to increase the fine to  &pound;20,000 so that those who do flout the regulations are properly penalised in order  to ensure compliance.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is hard to fathom why the Department would have a  different view when dealing with the new proposals for the private rented  sector. Some of us on the Committee believed that heavy fines should be used  for those who ignored new registration regulations in the private rented sector  also. In the end, the Committee took direction from the Department of Justice,  which said that heavy fines would not be awarded by courts. Therefore, we  accepted its advice to have repeated penalties for non-compliance.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have argued for some time that we needed to review the  powers available to deal with antisocial behaviour and how we can strengthen  the hands of housing providers and the courts when dealing with such cases.  Clauses 9 and 10 deal with the disclosure of information between statutory  bodies and those who have been involved in or sentenced for antisocial  behaviour. Those bodies can also withhold the right to buy and a person&rsquo;s right  to request a transfer from someone who has been involved in antisocial  activity.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There should have been legislation to deal with other  elements of antisocial behaviour, such as vandalism, which is rampant in many  areas and costs tens of thousands of pounds a year. The Bill deals with the  issue of transfer of antisocial tenants from Housing Executive to housing  association property without the other knowing. Those bodies are now obligated  to share information if the person requesting the transfer has been involved in  antisocial activity.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The widespread intimidation of neighbours and the community  by housing authority tenants in housing estates must be covered by legislation.  During a debate on this subject, I asked the former Minister for Social  Development about additional powers. She advised me that the Housing Executive  had extensive powers to deal with that kind of behaviour. On inspection, she  was proved to be right: the antisocial behaviour guidelines showed that there  are extensive powers. However, they are not used. I am told that, before they  can be enacted, someone in the community is required to give evidence. That  makes them effectively worthless as most people are too terrified to give  evidence against people who threaten and intimidate residents. We need to look  constantly at how we deal with the issue. It has become the single biggest  issue raised by our constituents.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the area in which I live and which I represent,  nine-year-olds, 10-year-olds and 11-year-olds terrorise parts of the area. They  have no respect for their community. They attack buses, other service vehicles  and the homes of residents. When you contact any of the statutory authorities,  they say that there is nothing they can do as it is a policing matter. However,  the police say that they cannot deal with the problem because of the age of  those who are involved. It is an issue that falls between the stools. The  statutory agencies pass the buck while local residents are left to suffer the  consequences. In other jurisdictions, new legislation has been enacted to deal  with those issues. It involves working with the parents of those children and  developing different strategies to involve communities in tackling that blight.  We need to seriously look at that in the next mandate. We should take the best  legislation from other jurisdictions and legislate for those issues here.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 12 generated a lot of debate because of the  possibilities for reduced pricing of household fuel. Given that fuel prices are  currently sky high, if that were to be delivered, it would be of great benefit  to tenants. I thank the Minister for informing us of the meeting that took  place recently between him and fuel suppliers. If some sort of deal can be  done, it will be of great benefit to those who can least afford fuel. This  legislation should be kept under review.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When we look at the Scottish example, we can see that it  introduced mandatory legislation for the private rented sector purely to deal  with antisocial behaviour. Now, it is strengthening its legislation to deal  with compliance problems. We need to ensure that we do the same. We also  believe that any scheme should be self-funding, with a levy per licence per  house set.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The other issue, which my colleague touched on and which I  have raised over the past number of years, is the common selection scheme. I  think that I have met three different Social Development Ministers over the  past number of years. It just does not work in areas of high demand. It  condemns people to hostels for many years. Hostels in my constituency are full  to capacity. People are being offered places as far away as Derry  and Coleraine. Over the past number of years, I have been promised a review to  deal with that matter. It is an issue that needs to be legislated for and that  needs to be changed. We need to ensure that those who unfortunately find  themselves in areas of high demand can go into a hostel with the knowledge that  they will not spend three or four years in it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I support the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank Members for their various contributions. I  agree with the Deputy Chairperson that the Committee, in its attention to the  Bill and all other matters before it, went about its business carefully and  seriously. As I said on a previous occasion, it seems that the Social  Development Committee has set standards against which it and all Committees  should be judged. I again acknowledge the various contributions that Committee  members made at Committee and through the various stages of the legislation and  their contributions to the work of the Department and the proposals for legislation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the comments that were made by Tommy Gallagher  and Anna Lo about mandatory registration, energy brokering and antisocial  activity. Those issues were also touched on by Mr McCann. I will make a number  of comments about various other contributions.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">1.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McCann and Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n referred to acute housing need  in parts of Northern Ireland,  including in north and west Belfast.  I concur; but ring-fencing, as a strategy, was deemed to be inequitable and  there was evidence to suggest that that was the case. Consequently, although a  review is ongoing, in moving forward, we may rework and adjust the common  selection scheme, where appropriate, proportionate, consistent and  legally-proper, to recognise areas of acute need.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I will in a second.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to make it very clear that neither I nor my  predecessor, Margaret Ritchie, chose to ignore &mdash; the language used by Ms N&iacute;  Chuil&iacute;n &mdash; that issue. Far from it: the review of the common selection scheme  and where, in time, all of that may or may not go is not ignoring an issue. It  is trying to address an issue in a way that applies best practice, is based on  evidence, addresses acute need and does so proportionately and legally. I will  give way to the Member.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  Voluntary housing bodies in the city and many in the Housing Executive who have  to operate the common selection scheme say that it is seriously flawed. The old  A1 and A2 model, which was said to have been abused, has been replaced by a  scheme that does not take into account areas that are under severe pressure.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Anyone who is unfortunate to go straight into a hostel with  90 points &mdash; 70 for being homeless and, maybe, 20 extra points &mdash; could sit there  for years without the possibility of being housed. People have been able to use  the system to their advantage. In areas that we represent, people may need 200  or 220 points before they are housed, and they have no chance of getting those  points. In other parts of the city and of the North, people with 90 or 100 points  may be housed.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank the Member for his contribution to the debate.  I hear, know and acknowledge all that he said, but it is still wrong to  conclude that I or my predecessor chose to ignore all of that. It is not backed  up by the facts, the evidence or by the conduct of Margaret Ritchie or me as  Minister.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, if anybody has chosen to ignore something, it  is that Margaret Ritchie was able to get more than 1,800 newbuild starts last  year. I hope to surpass that this year. It will mean that over the past three  years there have been around 5,000 new starts. Over the next three or four  years, the number of new starts will collapse to 1,200 or 1,300 a year. So, go  to north and west Belfast, go to areas of most acute need and tell the people  who are in hostels for longer than they should be and the people who are on  180, 200 or 220 points that the answer to their problems lies in the Budget  that was passed by the Assembly last week, which will see public sector newbuilds  collapse to 1,200 or 1,300 a year. Then ask them who they think is ignoring  their needs.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Yes, something is seriously flawed. It is seriously flawed,  Mr Deputy Speaker, when we have, as Ms Lo pointed out, 38,000 people in housing  need and 19,000 in housing stress. In my view, those figures will escalate over  the next four years, because people who lose their homes through mortgage debt,  mortgage arrears and home repossessions will seek to be rehoused. The  consequences of welfare changes and housing benefit cuts will, I believe,  increase stress and will see my successor in the next Executive living with  figures for general housing need in excess of 38,000 and housing stress of more  than 19,000. What was the response of our Government to all of that? It was not  even to build the 2,500 houses a year that will be needed going forward but to  reduce that number to about half, without putting into the equation the  additional needs and stresses that will arise over the next four years.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I beg to differ with Members who say that Margaret Ritchie  or I chose to ignore issues around the common selection scheme. It appears to  me that this House last week and the Executive the week before chose to ignore  the levels of housing stress that currently exist and will exist in the next  number of years. Remember that for &pound;80 million we can build around 1,000  houses. So, if &pound;80 million is to go into certain parts of Northern Ireland &mdash; it  will be only certain parts of Northern Ireland under the social investment fund  &mdash; let the people of those areas also understand that, although that fund may  have some worthy intentions, the consequences of it will be that fewer houses  will be built in those areas; people will be in hostels for even longer than  before; and people on the waiting list will be waiting for longer than before.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I will in a second. If people want to say that things  are seriously flawed, they should not look at an issue such as the common  selection scheme, which is being looked at, but at the fundamentals of the  Budget, which, Mr McCann and Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n, will see people in your  constituencies, as in mine, suffer more housing stress and more housing need  because of that decision.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  I first raised this issue seven years ago, when it was the responsibility of a  British Secretary of State. I then met Margaret Ritchie about it, and I was  given a guarantee both times. So, long before the decision was taken last week  on the Budget, as the Minister says, we asked for major changes to be made to  the common selection scheme in order to take people out of hostels.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister knows that I and my two party colleagues on  the Social Development Committee have supported at length his call for  additional funding for social housing. We have done that continuously in  Committee. There are two other issues that we have argued for. The first is the  mortgage relief fund. In every monitoring round, the Department applied for &pound;5  million, but, during that whole period, millions of pounds were handed back to  the centre, and the Minister did not look at how it would be funded from his  own budget.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. There are a couple of issues. We need to make progress on  the Bill and to try to stay close to it. I remind Members that interventions  are supposed to be brief.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank the Member for that class. There is not a  Member in the House, whether in the Social Development Committee or anywhere  else, who has not made the argument for more newbuild housing. Everybody has  made that argument. The point is that when people had to lift their arms,  whether around the Executive table or in the Assembly &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. I will not permit interventions from a sedentary position  at all.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: That is right; I did not raise my hand, but Members to  my right happened to raise their hands, and, in doing so, they sent out the  message about the newbuild budget for the next four or five years, they sent  out the message about the other priorities that will be going over the next  four or five years, and they sent out the message that the proposed reduction  of &pound;80 million in the housing newbuild spend in what was then the draft Budget  was coincidently &mdash; no doubt it was purely coincidental &mdash; replicated in a  different Budget line for OFMDFM for the so-called social investment fund. When  it comes to the mortgage relief fund, I welcome the Member&rsquo;s contribution. I  remind him that in the hardship paper that I submitted to the Executive in the  autumn and which, I presume, is now manifest in the Budget in the form of the  social protection fund, one of the arguments that I made at that time and in  two subsequent papers to OFMDFM was that part of the hardship money or, as it  is now known, the social protection fund, should go on a &pound;5 million mortgage  rescue scheme. That is what I argued for. Furthermore, I argued for specific  interventions to help families and individuals who are in mortgage stress  because of the ending of the scheme that gives support for mortgage interest  (SMI) after two years. I have put in costed proposals to intervene to help  those in mortgage stress, whether through a mortgage rescue scheme or  individual payments for those who will lose SMI after two years, and so on and  so forth in respect of child tax credit.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome Mr McCann&rsquo;s comments. I trust that when the  social protection, or hardship, fund is eventually worked through, those will  be key elements in the distribution and spend of the money, low though the  fund&rsquo;s overall budget may be.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>:  The Minister talks about mortgage relief schemes. Your predecessor first  brought the matter forward in February 2008, long before we were talking about  the current Budget. Why has it taken three years? You are talking about  bringing forward a paper and doing this, that and &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. I remind Members that the only &ldquo;you&rdquo; in the Assembly is the  Deputy Speaker.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank the Member for his question. There is a simple  answer: time after time after time after time after time after time in  monitoring rounds, Margaret Ritchie asked for money to be released for a  mortgage rescue scheme. That is on record, and all your Ministers know it; they  saw the monitoring round bids that went to DFP. Therefore it is not that it  suddenly emerged two or three years later; it has been part of the argument  presented by DSD month after month, quarterly return after quarterly return,  over the past two or three years &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  You have just handed back millions.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: Yes, and as Mr McCann should well know, in monitoring  rounds &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. I remind Members, including the Minister, that all remarks  must be made through the Chair. Moreover, we have gone completely off the Bill,  so we need to get back to it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I will return to the Bill shortly, Mr Deputy Speaker.  However, to address the last point, financial rules require that where a budget  line is not spent and where approval has not been granted to move that budget  line into an alternative budget line, the money has to be returned to DFP. That  happens in monitoring rounds: where moneys that are not and cannot be spent in  the financial cycle and where DFP will not grant approval to move them to a  different budget line &mdash; desirable though that may be &mdash; they have to be  returned. What happens to those moneys? They fund the fiasco that is  Crossnacreevy, where a &pound;200 million budget &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. When I was a member of the Committee  for Finance and Personnel, I raised the issue of mortgage relief. At that  stage, I raised the point about continually applying for the &pound;5 million and was  told that &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Good try, but that is not a point of order. The Minister should  stay on the subject of the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: To conclude that point, in my view, Crossnacreevy &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  That has nothing to do with the Housing (Amendment) Bill.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I ask Members to cease making comments from a sedentary position.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: To conclude the point, Crossnacreevy was a capital  receipt &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Spratt</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. What has Crossnacreevy, which is a  matter for the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, to do with the  Housing (Amendment) Bill?</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">1.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I have repeatedly asked Members and the Minister to stay on the  subject of the Bill, and I must insist that we do that.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I was simply replying to a point made by Mr McCann  about monitoring rounds by giving the full story of monitoring rounds and how  one Department can make such a grave error as to say that it will get a capital  receipt of &pound;200 million and end up with the potential &mdash; it is still not sold &mdash;  of a receipt of 1% of what went into the budget line four years ago.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I acknowledge the points made by various Members about the  new powers on antisocial behaviour in the Bill. That matter was raised at  various stages, including at Second Stage on the Floor of the House. I want to  acknowledge that it was the application of Members&rsquo; minds and views on the  matter which resulted in it appearing in the Bill to be passed today. However,  I want to make one point. The Housing Executive has extensive powers but, as  with all powers, whether for the Housing Executive, government or any other  public body, it falls to the individual to make issues of concern known to the public  body in order for it to exercise its powers. You cannot have a situation where  a public body, without due process and good evidence, acts unilaterally or  arbitrarily or ends up imposing summary justice on people against whom  allegations have been made but not proven.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is a very difficult situation, and there is, in parts of  our community, a culture where that may lead to difficulties, troubles and  problems for those who take that stand. We have to be appreciative of that.  However, you cannot have a situation where the powers granted to any public  body or to government should be used in a unilateral, arbitrary or summary way,  and I trust that we will not go down that road.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McCann raised the issue of fines. I made representations  to the Justice Minister about trying to deal with the issue of penalties in the  way that Mr McCann suggested. I understand that the Justice Minister was  advised by the Northern Ireland Courts and Tribunals Service that the  magistrates and the judiciary frowned upon some of that approach. However, I  had sympathy with it, and, through officials, I interrogated and had exhaustive  conversations with the Justice Department in that regard. However, at this  stage, that is where the issue resides. As I understand it, there were concerns  about whether the proposed fines were disproportionate to fines in other pieces  of legislation enforced by the courts.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">All that being said, and save the cross words that I  uttered in the direction of Mr McCann and a few others, I think that the Bill is  a substantial piece of legislation. It is an advance on what was in the  original Bill. I want to acknowledge the work of all those involved in  drafting, preparing and considering the Bill as it went through the Assembly. I  commend the Bill to the House.</p>

    <p class="B3BodyText">The statutory rule has been made under powers contained in  article 8 of the Departments (Northern    Ireland) Order 1999, which provides that the  2011 Order must be laid for approval by affirmative resolution of the Assembly.  The Order under discussion today seeks to give effect to a decision of the  Executive to create a more coherent tribunals administration delivered by the  Courts and Tribunals Service, which is an agency of the Department of Justice.  The Order will transfer to the Department of Justice certain statutory  functions relating to the administration of a number of tribunals which are  presently the responsibility of other Departments.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The effect of the Order will be that the Department of  Justice will assume responsibility for the administration of the following  tribunals: the Mental Health Review Tribunal, the Care Tribunal and tribunals  under section 11 of the Health and Personal Social Services (NI) Order 1972  from the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety; the Special  Educational Needs and Disability Tribunal from the Department of Education; the  Lands Tribunal from the Department of Finance and Personnel; the Traffic  Penalty Tribunal from the Department for Regional Development; and the Health  and Safety Tribunal from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment.  All relevant Assembly Committees have been consulted on those proposed  transfers, and I appreciate their support. I commend the Order to the House.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister  (Mr Elliott)</strong>: The Committee was briefed by officials from the Department of  Justice on the Departments (Transfer of Functions) Order at its meeting on 15  December 2010. The Order allows the Department of Justice to assume  responsibility for the administration of a number of tribunals. At the  Committee&rsquo;s meeting on 16 February 2011, it considered correspondence from the  Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister, which confirmed which  tribunals would be transferred. The Committee considered further the statutory  rule at its meeting on 2 March 2011 and resolved that it be affirmed by the  Assembly.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Justice (Lord Morrow)</strong>: I am pleased to speak to this  motion as Chairman of the Committee for Justice. I confirm that the Committee  has agreed to the transfer of statutory responsibility for the administration  of tribunals from relevant Departments to the Department of Justice as is set  out in the Departments (Transfer of Functions) Order (Northern Ireland)  2011.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee was first briefed in May 2010 by officials from  the Northern Ireland Courts and Tribunals Service on the tribunal reform  programme and the proposal for the Department of Justice to assume statutory  responsibility for the administration of tribunals. The tribunal reform  programme is focused on creating a unified administration for tribunals that is  more independent, efficient and customer-focused.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Prior to devolution, the transfer of tribunal  administration to the Court Service could be achieved only by way of agency  arrangements that allowed the sponsor Department to contract the Court Service  for the performance of tribunal functions on an agency basis by leaving its  statutory responsibility in the hands of the Department. The devolution of  policing and justice provides the opportunity for the Department of Justice to  assume full statutory responsibility for the administration of tribunals.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee for Justice agreed that it was content with  the proposal, but, before responding to the Department on the matter, it sought  the views of other relevant Statutory Committees, including the Health  Committee, the Education Committee, the Committee for the Office of the First  Minister and deputy First Minister, the Regional Development Committee, the  Social Development Committee, the Committee for Finance and Personnel, the  Committee for Employment and Learning and the Committee for Enterprise, Trade  and Investment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">All the Committees indicated that they were content with  the proposals, but the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety  raised some concerns about the proposal around perceived criminalisation of the  two health tribunals, especially if individuals with mental health problems  thought that the tribunal was criminal-based. The Health Committee advocated  that steps should be taken to ensure that people who use the care and mental  health tribunals do not feel stigmatised. The Committee expressed the view that  courthouses should not be used for health tribunals because they intimidate  people and give the perception of criminalisation. In taking forward the  proposals, the Committee for Justice asked the Department of Justice to address  the issues that the Health Committee raised. The Department responded on two  occasions to clarify the position.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On 16 December 2010, the Committee for the Office of the  First Minister and deputy First Minister wrote to seek the views of the  Committee for Justice on the proposed transfer of functions or tribunal reform  Order. The Committee sought and received an assurance from the Department of  Justice that satisfactory agreement had been reached with the relevant  Departments on the functions and, in particular, the resources, that is,  budgets and staff, to be transferred. It received an assurance that tribunals  would transfer only where a transfer of appropriate funding is needed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee for Justice agreed at its meeting on 27  January that, in light of the information that was provided by the Department  of Justice, it was content with the proposals made in the Departments (Transfer  of Functions) Order and supports the motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I call the junior Minister Mr Gerry Kelly to conclude and make a  winding-up speech on the debate.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Mr G Kelly)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I  commend the House for affirming the Order, and I look forward to further  progress on tribunal reform.</p>

    <p class="Q3Motion">That the Departments (Transfer of Functions) (No. 2) Order (Northern Ireland)  2011 be affirmed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The statutory rule has been made under powers in article 8  of the Departments (Northern    Ireland) Order 1999, which provides that the  2011 Order must be laid for approval by affirmative resolution of the Assembly.  Under the Statistics of Trade and Employment (Northern Ireland) Order 1988, the  Order under discussion will transfer certain statutory functions of the  Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment to the Department of Finance and  Personnel.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The functions that are being transferred relate to the  requirement to undertake an annual census of production, the option to conduct  a census of distribution and services, and matters related to the conduct of  such surveys. The transfer will enable the production of economic and labour  market statistics to be centralised in NISRA, which has a primary focus on the  production of high-quality official statistics, independent of the policy areas  to which the statistics relate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Such an arrangement will help to strengthen public trust in  official statistics. That will facilitate increased standardisation and  harmonisation of methodologies between the main economic and social official  statistics series. All the relevant Committees have been consulted about the  proposed transfer, and their support and co-operation in the prompt  consideration of the matter is appreciated. I commend the Order to the House.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister  (Mr Elliott)</strong>: The Committee for the Office of the First Minister and deputy  First Minister first considered the draft Departments (Transfer of Functions)  (No. 2) Order at its meeting of 16 February 2011. The Order seeks to transfer  the responsibility for the collection of data from businesses and the  production of the official labour market and economic statistics from the  Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment to the Northern Ireland  Statistics and Research Agency, which is part of the Department of Finance and  Personnel. The Committee further considered the statutory rule at its meeting  of 2 March 2011 and resolved that it be affirmed by the Assembly.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Mr G Kelly)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle,  especially for an easy day. I thank the Chairperson for those comments. I  commend the Order to the House, and I look forward to further progress on the  reduction of official economic and labour market statistics.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That the Departments (Transfer of Functions) (No. 2) Order (Northern Ireland)  2011 be affirmed.</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading"><a name="7"></a>Energy Bill: Legislative Consent Motion</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment (Mrs Foster)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly agrees that the UK Parliament should  consider amendments to the Energy Bill to provide powers for the Department of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment to establish a scheme to facilitate and  encourage renewable generation of heat, including the administration and  financing of the scheme.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We are here today to consider extending primary legislative  powers for renewable heat to Northern    Ireland to ensure that my Department can  bring forward proposals to incentivise this important market in the near  future. Ensuring a more diverse, sustainable and secure supply of fuel for Northern Ireland  is one of the key priorities for my Department.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Northern    Ireland is overly dependent on imported  fuel, leaving customers vulnerable to price fluctuations that are beyond our  control. That is especially true in the heat market. Heat energy accounts for  close to half of all the energy consumed in Northern Ireland; however, 98% of  our heating fuels are imported.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In order for the Northern Ireland heat market to  become more sustainable, it is vital that renewable fuel sources are developed  and that the uptake of renewable heating technologies is encouraged. The  strategic energy framework includes a target for Northern Ireland to achieve 10%  renewable heat by 2020. That is an ambitious and stretching target, especially  when we consider that only 1&middot;7% of our heating demand is met from renewable  sources.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In order to reach that target, it is essential that support  mechanisms are developed to encourage the uptake of renewable heat technologies  in the domestic, commercial, industrial and public sectors. The Department of  Energy and Climate Change (DECC) has made clear plans to incentivise the  renewable heat market in Great    Britain through a renewable heat incentive.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  heat market is very different to that of Great Britain. Northern Ireland is largely dependent on oil  with a developing natural gas market, whereas in Great Britain, the gas market is  well established and is the predominant fuel source. There are also differences  in fuel prices between Great Britain  and Northern Ireland  and the amount of people&rsquo;s income that goes towards heating their homes and  businesses. As a consequence, the levels of fuel poverty tend to be higher.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  geography is very different to that of Great   Britain, with Northern Ireland being more rural,  having fewer larger cities and, therefore, having a very different heat  density. All of those factors have meant that it has been appropriate for  separate consideration to be given to how the heat market here might be  encouraged and incentivised, so that a Northern   Ireland solution can be developed for the Northern Ireland  context.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In September 2010, I announced that my Department would  seek to support the renewable heat market in Northern   Ireland by developing a renewable heat incentive scheme  similar to the Great Britain  proposals, but specifically designed and tailored to incentivise the local  market. Work on that is already under way.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In response to that announcement, Her Majesty&rsquo;s Treasury  has allocated &pound;25 million for the spending review period for a Northern Ireland  renewable heat incentive, should one be introduced. That is a significant level  of funding, which will have a positive impact on the emerging industry. In order  for an incentive scheme to be introduced in the future, the Department for Enterprise, Trade and  Investment (DETI) requires appropriate legislative powers to create tariff  structures, set eligibility standards and make payments. At present, DETI does  not hold any primary powers in that area of work. DECC took primary powers for  renewable heat via last-minute amendments to the Energy Act 2008. Those are  general, enabling powers that, in turn, will allow the GB renewable heat  initiative to be designed and implemented through specific secondary  legislation. I now seek the Assembly&rsquo;s consent to enable DECC to amend the  current Energy Bill to provide powers for DETI to introduce and administer a  Northern Ireland renewable heat incentive in due course.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Taking those powers through that route will allow my  Department to introduce an incentive scheme via detailed subordinate  legislation in a timely manner. If that opportunity is missed, there could be  significant ramifications for the date on which an incentive scheme could be  introduced, which, in turn, would have a negative impact on the local market  and result in the loss of an element of the funding that is provided by  Treasury. The Executive are content with the course of action that we are  taking today.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I should stress that the powers to be taken by DETI will be  general, enabling powers for renewable heat similar to those in section 100 of  the Energy Act 2008, which grant DECC with the necessary primary powers. A  future renewable heat incentive for Northern Ireland will require  secondary legislation in due course. In addition, there will be a full public  consultation on the design of the renewable heat incentive in advance of  implementation. It will be vital that consumers, industry, local  representatives and, indeed, other relevant stakeholders get a chance to  contribute to the policy-making process.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Financial incentives have already been successful in the Northern Ireland  renewable electricity market. Since the introduction of the Northern Ireland  renewables obligation (NIRO) in 2005, the level of electricity that has been  generated from renewable sources has increased from 3% to around 9%. It is now  important for a similar commitment to be made to the renewable heat market. I  am confident that by supporting and developing the renewable heat market there  will be positive opportunities for Northern Ireland to reduce its  dependence on imported fossil fuels, cut carbon emissions and develop the  emerging renewables industry with new green jobs. I ask the House to pass the  legislative consent motion to allow us to take a further important step in that  process.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and  Investment (Mr A Maginness)</strong>: The Committee for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment supports the Minister&rsquo;s motion that the UK Parliament  should consider amendments to the Energy Bill to extend powers to permit Northern Ireland  to legislate on renewable heat, including a renewable heat incentive scheme. We  regard the latter as an important step in the incentivisation of that  particular sector of the renewables market.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On 2 February 2011, the Minister wrote to the Committee to  make known her intention to bring forward the motion. Members of the Committee  welcomed her proposals, as we had long considered the issue of renewable heat  and pressed the Department to bring forward proposals that would allow Northern Ireland  to legislate for it. During Committee Stage of the Northern Ireland Energy  Bill, which is now the Energy Act (Northern Ireland) 2011, the Committee  considered the possibility of including powers to legislate for renewable heat.  However, that was not feasible because of the remit of that Bill and the  protracted timescales that would have been involved.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee made a specific recommendation after its  recent inquiry into renewable energy. Its report stated:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;In the short-term, Government policy on biomass  should concentrate on renewable heat to assist in meeting the Strategic Energy  Framework target of 10 of heat from renewable sources by 2020.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Members may wonder why it is so important for Northern Ireland  to have powers to legislate for renewable heat. It is because those powers will  allow Northern Ireland  to create an incentive to ensure that the energy market is encouraged to  generate renewable heat.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As many in the Chamber are aware, the coalition Government  announced funding of &pound;850 million for a renewable heat incentive scheme in the UK, of which Northern Ireland has been offered  20%. In its renewable energy report, the Committee also recommended:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;DETI should also give favourable consideration to the  Treasury offer of &pound;25 million for a Renewable Heat Incentive for Northern Ireland.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The motion before the House will facilitate  amendments to the UK Energy Bill to enable DETI to take up the Treasury offer  of &pound;25 million and to bring forward a renewable heat incentive bespoke to Northern Ireland  by the end of this year. The only alternative to that would be to introduce  primary legislation, which would lead to unnecessary delays.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As the Minister said, the motion is timely, and it is right  and proper that the Assembly should support it. It is imperative that Northern Ireland  create its own renewable heat incentive scheme, as that will ultimately lead to  the achievement of the goal of 10% of heat from renewable sources by 2020, as  stated in the strategic energy framework.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At its meeting of 24 February, the Committee took oral  evidence from departmental officials on what implications for renewable heat in  Northern Ireland  would result from the Bill. Members were satisfied that the motion was a  necessary step in implementing a renewable heat incentive in Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Before I conclude, I wish to thank the Minister. This is an  appropriate opportunity to thank her for her co-operation, courtesy and, indeed,  good humour throughout my chairmanship of the Committee over the past two  years. A lot of constructive work was done by the Committee in co-operation  with the Department and the Minister. I also thank the departmental officials who  attended the Committee on various occasions and carried out their work in an  exemplary manner. I hope that that good working relationship will continue in  the next mandate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On behalf of the Committee, I urge the Assembly to support  the Minister&rsquo;s motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment</strong>: I thank my Executive  colleagues for agreeing to the motion coming to the House, and I thank the  Committee for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment and the Business Committee for the way in which they  considered the matter. They did so in a timely fashion, which allowed the  motion to come before the House today. I appreciate the positive manner in  which the issue has been dealt with by all sides of the House.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The development of renewable heat is a key objective of the  Department. Indeed, as the Chairman said, it has a lot of synergies with last  month&rsquo;s Committee report on renewable energy. Our wider policy aims of  increasing fuel security, reducing carbon emissions and creating green jobs all  fall into line with the creation of a renewable heat incentive specifically for  Northern Ireland. By passing the consent motion today, we will highlight our  intention to incentivise that market and highlight the priority that the  Executive and the Assembly have given to renewable energy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Chairman for his kind words about the workings  between my Department and the Committee and between him and me. It has been a  great honour for me to hold this portfolio. It has been challenging at times,  but very varied, and I thank him for the Committee&rsquo;s support and scrutiny for  all that we have done in the past three years. I commend the motion to the  House.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">That this Assembly agrees that the UK Parliament  should consider amendments to the Energy Bill to provide powers for the  Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment to establish a scheme to  facilitate and encourage renewable generation of heat, including the  administration and financing of the scheme.</p>

    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment (Mrs Foster)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">That the Categories of Tourist Establishment Order (Northern Ireland)  2011 be affirmed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I am seeking the Assembly&rsquo;s affirmation for the  Categories of Tourist Establishment Order (Northern Ireland) 2011. The Order  amends article 12(1) of the Tourism (Northern Ireland) Order 1992, which  lists the statutory categories of tourist establishments that are inspected and  certified by the Northern Ireland Tourist Board. At present, there are five  categories of tourist accommodation listed in the 1992 Order: hotels;  guesthouses; bed-and-breakfast establishments; self-catering establishments;  and hostels. Article 12(2) of the 1992 Order provides for that list to be  amended by adding or removing categories by statutory rule made by the  affirmative resolution procedure before the Assembly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment and the  Northern Ireland Tourist Board have identified a number of changes required to  the 1992 Order and associated subordinate legislation, including the addition  of three new categories of tourist accommodation to the current list. Those are  bunkhouses, campus accommodation and guest accommodation. The purpose and  nature of those three categories is as follows. A bunkhouse offers simple  overnight accommodation for use by walkers and backpackers. Campus  accommodation is provided by educational establishments for their students  during term time and is made available to visitors at other times of the year.  The primary focus of guest accommodation is the provision of bedrooms for  visitors. That category would, for example, facilitate restaurants that wish to  provide rooms for visitors. The introduction of those three new categories will  facilitate tourist accommodation providers. A separate set of regulations  setting out the detailed criteria to be met by those three new categories will  come into operation during April.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">That the Categories of Tourist Establishment Order (Northern Ireland)  2011 be affirmed.</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading"><a name="9"></a>Draft Insolvency (Monetary Limits) (Amendment) Order (Northern Ireland)  2011</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The next three items of business are motions to approve statutory rules  for matters relating to insolvency and debt. There will be separate debates on  each of the statutory rules; however, Members will be allowed some latitude to  address the broad policy issue that is clearly common to all the motions during  the first debate. I hope that Members will find that useful.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment (Mrs Foster)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">That the draft Insolvency (Monetary Limits)  (Amendment) Order (Northern    Ireland) 2011 be approved.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I am seeking the Assembly&rsquo;s approval for the draft  Insolvency (Monetary Limits) (Amendment) Order (Northern Ireland) 2011. The Order  is one of a group of six statutory rules being made in conjunction with the  Debt Relief Act (Northern    Ireland) 2010. Three of the six statutory  rules require Assembly approval. Of the three that do not, one is subject to  the negative procedure, one is a straightforward commencement Order and is not  subject to Assembly proceedings at all, and the third is being taken forward by  the Department of Justice and is subject to negative procedure.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">After the debate on this Order, and subject to its being  approved by the Assembly, I will ask the Assembly to approve a second draft  Order and to affirm a third Order.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">First, I will set out the general policy objective behind  the Debt Relief Act (Northern    Ireland) 2010 and the purpose served by each  of the three statutory rules for which Assembly approval or affirmation is  required and which are being debated today. I will respond to any points raised  by Members in my closing remarks.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Debt Relief Act (Northern Ireland) 2010 received  Royal Assent on 15 December 2010. It paved the way for my Department to set up  a debt relief scheme in Northern Ireland,  similar to the one that has operated in England  and Wales  since April 2009. The scheme will provide for those who are burdened with debt  that they cannot pay and who cannot afford the cost of petitioning for  bankruptcy to apply to the official receiver for a debt relief order, which  will offer similar relief at less than a third of the cost. Applications for  debt relief orders will be made through trained debt advisers. That will  provide an opportunity for the applicant&rsquo;s financial circumstances to be  assessed and for checks to be made to ensure that they meet the eligibility  criteria that will apply. Debt advisers will have to be approved by competent  authorities that are designated by the Department.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A debt relief order will provide a one-year moratorium to  protect debtors against legal proceedings or enforcement actions by their  creditors. Liability to repay debts covered by the order will be completely  cancelled at the end of that year. It will be possible for those found culpable  to be placed under continuing restrictions for between two and 15 years  regarding their taking of credit or the name under which they can trade. Such  restrictions can either be put in place by the High Court through the making of  a debt relief restrictions order or through acceptance by my Department of what  is termed a debt relief restrictions undertaking. It is estimated that there  will be approximately 1,000 applications for debt relief each year.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Among the eligibility criteria that will apply is that the  applicant&rsquo;s debt, sizeable assets and surplus income do not exceed limits that  will be specified in subordinate legislation, and the Order that the House is  now considering will establish those limits. It specifies the maximum amount of  debt that an individual can have to be eligible for the scheme as &pound;15,000, the  maximum total value of their assets as &pound;300 and their maximum surplus income as  &pound;50 a month. Questions on those limits were included in a consultation exercise  that was carried out between February and May 2009 on the proposals to set up a  debt relief scheme.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Of 460 people and organisations that were notified about  the consultation, 22 responded. Of the 14 respondents who answered a question  on whether there should be a limit on the amount an individual could owe to  obtain entry to the scheme, 13 agreed that there should be one. Of the 18  respondents who answered a question about the amount of debt, eight were  content with a &pound;15,000 limit, one felt that the &pound;15,000 limit was too high, and  six thought that it was too low. Of the 14 respondents who answered a question  on a limit of &pound;300 of realisable assets, only two felt that &pound;300 was too low.  Of the 15 respondents who answered a question on whether there should be a cap  on surplus income, 14 agree that there should. Of the six respondents who  answered a question on what the amount of that surplus income should be, only  two expressed a view that &pound;50 was too low.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The limits that are specified in the draft Insolvency  (Monetary Limits) (Amendment) Order (Northern Ireland) 2011 for maximum debt,  asset value and surplus income are exactly the same as the scheme that operates  in England and Wales, which is as it should be. The problems facing individuals  who are in debt in Northern Ireland  are no different from those that are encountered, at an individual level, in England and Wales.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is expected that most of those who will avail of the  debt relief scheme will be in receipt of benefits. Benefit levels in Northern Ireland are at parity with those in England and Wales,  and keeping the eligibility criteria the same will ensure that those who need  to make use of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  debt relief scheme will be treated no differently from those who need to make  use of the scheme in England  and Wales.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Debt Relief Act (Northern Ireland) 2010 makes it an  offence for a person who is subject to a debt relief order, a debt relief  restrictions order or a debt relief restrictions undertaking to obtain credit  without disclosing that he is subject to such an order or undertaking. However,  there is a proviso that no offence will have been committed if the amount of  credit is less than is specified by the Order. The draft Insolvency (Monetary  Limits) (Amendment) Order (Northern    Ireland) 2011 specifies that amount as &pound;500.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will deal separately with the other two Orders when the  remaining two motions are moved. One deals with the fee payable on application  for a debt relief order. The other provides that conduct prior to commencement  of the Debt Relief Act is not to be taken into account in assessing whether a  person should be made subject to a debt relief restrictions order or  undertaking.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am grateful to the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment and the  Examiner of Statutory Rules for their scrutiny of all three Orders. I hope that  I have provided the House with sufficient explanation of their purpose, and I  will, of course, respond in my closing remarks to any points made by Members.</p>

    <p class="B3BodyText">The Order sets at &pound;90 the fee payable on an application for  a debt relief order. That includes &pound;10 for the cost of the debt advisers who  will act as intermediaries to help to administer the scheme. The balance will  be paid into the insolvency account to help meet the scheme&rsquo;s running costs.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A &pound;90 fee enables the Insolvency Service for England and Wales to operate its scheme on a  full-cost-recovery basis owing to the much higher volume of cases and a more  fully automated IT system. If I were to ensure full cost recovery, my  Department would have to charge a fee of &pound;207, which would mean citizens in Northern Ireland having to pay &pound;117 more than in  England and Wales to obtain  a debt relief order. I have, therefore, decided to keep the fee at the same level  as that in England and Wales even  though my officials advised me that charging a fee of &pound;90 will result in a  shortfall to the Department.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As there will be no differences in the benefits offered by  debt relief orders made in Northern Ireland compared with those made in England  and Wales, it would be unfair to charge a higher fee to applicants in Northern  Ireland solely because the Northern Ireland scheme costs more to administer  owing to its smaller scale. Furthermore, it has been a long-standing convention  that, where possible, insolvency law be kept in parity with that in England and Wales. Therefore, I ask the  Assembly to affirm the Insolvency (Fees) (Amendment) Order (Northern Ireland)  2011.</p>

    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">That the draft Debt Relief (2010 Act) (Transitional  Provision) Order (Northern    Ireland) 2011 be approved.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a great interest in debt relief here today. I ask  that the Assembly approve the draft Debt Relief (2010 Act) (Transitional  Provision) Order (Northern    Ireland) 2011 in a similar manner. Under the  new schedule 2ZB, inserted into the Insolvency (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 by  the Debt Relief Act (Northern Ireland) 2010, my Department, or the Official  Receiver acting on the directions of my Department, can, in cases in which  there is evidence that someone subject to a debt relief order is culpable,  apply to the High Court for a debt relief restrictions order. Alternatively, my  Department can accept an undertaking from the person, and that has equivalent  effect.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A restrictions order, or undertaking, can last from two to  15 years. It places individuals under restrictions as regards the amount of  credit that they can obtain without disclosing that they are the subject of a  restrictions order or undertaking. It also places restrictions on their ability  to trade under any name other than that by which they were known on the  original debt relief order.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The draft Order 2011 provides that the court, when deciding  whether to make a debt relief restrictions order, and the Department, when  deciding whether to accept a debt relief restrictions undertaking, is to take  into account the debtor&rsquo;s conduct subsequent only to the date of commencement  of the scheme. I ask the Assembly to approve this Order as well.</p>

    <p class="OralAnswers-H2DepartmentHeading">Regional Development</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">A5 Dual Carriageway: Funding</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">1. <strong>Mr Ross </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development how much funding his Department  has earmarked for the A5 road scheme. (AQO 1253/11)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development (Mr Murphy)</strong>: The draft Budget allows my Department a  total of &pound;675 million for the A5 dualling project over the four-year period  from 2011-12 to 2014-15.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>:  Does the Minister agree that it is now looking increasingly likely that the  money pledged by the Irish Republic for road schemes in Northern Ireland  will be withdrawn by the new Government south of the border? Does he,  therefore, agree that the money that he had earmarked for the controversial A5  project, coupled with the &pound;107 million of additional funding in his budget,  would be much better spent on the much-needed and less controversial A2 scheme  in east Antrim? Will he give the House that commitment today?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I do not think that I have come across a major road  scheme that has not been controversial in some shape or form. I disagree with the  Member&rsquo;s first assertion that it is increasingly likely that the money pledged  will now be withdrawn. We have received no indication whatsoever that the  Government in the South have changed the approach to that. Indeed, I know that  the new Taoiseach Enda Kenny has expressed his support for the project in the  past. I will be seeking an early engagement with the newly appointed Transport  Minister to discuss some of those issues as soon as possible.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The A2 scheme, to which the Member refers, is a very good  one, and I am very disappointed that we do not have resources earmarked in the  four-year period to go ahead with that. Nonetheless, he will know that the  Executive worked very hard to identify additional moneys that we were able to  allocate as part of the final Budget, which was put to the Assembly last week.  The Budget review group will continue to try to identify additional moneys over  the four-year period, and I certainly expect that it will have some success in  doing so. If that is the case, it will hopefully allow additional money to go  to DRD for significant projects. Some of the projects that we have had to put  on hold at this moment in time may, therefore, come back into play during those  four years.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Callaghan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Does the Minister acknowledge the  concerns of those in the north-west and, in particular, Derry  city about the talk that the scheme might be downgraded? Will he give an  assurance that that is not within the contemplation of the Department and that  he will raise the issue with the Transport Minister? Has he already spoken to  him by phone about the scheme?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I am not sure where the Member heard the concerns  that the scheme will be downgraded. Every statement made on the back of a  North/South Ministerial Council plenary meeting has included a commitment to  the A5 project, and that commitment remains as is. I have not yet had an  opportunity to discuss that with the newly appointed Transport Minister, who is  in office only a couple of days, but I intend to seek an early meeting with him  to discuss that and a range of other projects.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The North/South agenda that I, as Minister here, and the  Transport Minister in the South operate is a very wide-ranging one. The A5 is  probably the single biggest project underneath that, but there is quite a range  of areas of co-operation and collaboration between us and the Transport  Department in the South. So, I will be seeking an early meeting to pick up on  all of those issues. However, as I said in response to previous questions, I  have received no indication that there is any change in approach. Certainly, as  far as Roads Service and I are concerned, that project remains as planned.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Will the Minister detail the proposed  timeline for the completion of the A5 project? I speak as a local MLA who  believes that that project is of huge strategic importance in providing access  to opportunity, investment and jobs in the wider north-west.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: The A5 project is progressing well, and the third key  milestone for the scheme was achieved on target with the publication of the  draft statutory Orders associated with the environmental statement in November  2010. That was followed by the formal public consultation period that ended on  21 January. Given the interest in the project and the level of objection  raised, I have decided that a public inquiry will be held to consider the  objections.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  I listened very carefully to the Minister&rsquo;s earlier replies and his mention of  the A2. Will he explain why a worthy scheme such as the A2, which will carry  30,000 vehicles a day, compares so unfavourably with the &pound;850 million scheme  for the A5, about which there is obviously a lot of dissension and which  carries only about 14,000 vehicles a day?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: The A2 was a very good project. The Member will know  from the debates that we have had over the past number of weeks that there has  been a 40% cut in our capital budget, which means that not all the projects  that we would like to go ahead with in the next Budget period can do so. That  has left difficult choices to be made. The decision to remove the A2 project  was very difficult.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The A5 project has been agreed by the Executive and the  Government in the South. It has been progressed jointly by us and the Southern  authorities and is of key strategic importance to the north-west. Although the  Member will make a very good argument, and very good arguments were made about  the A2, it was not a matter of two competing projects. We had to look at a  range of projects that we could go ahead with. Funding has been committed to  the A5 by both Administrations, and, as I said, the project is of significant  importance to the north-west.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a commitment in the Programme for Government to  address the infrastructure imbalance that we find. The same commitment comes  from Dublin as  well. If anyone looks at a map of Ireland, they will see very clearly  where the infrastructural imbalance is and that there are huge gaps in the  north-west. That commitment is from both Administrations.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It was not a matter of one project competing on the same  scale as another. It was a matter of making difficult choices in the face of a  difficult Budget allocation.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Railways: Sustainability</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">2. <strong>Ms N&iacute;  Chuil&iacute;n </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development for an update on his  Department&rsquo;s investment in sustainable rail transport. (AQO 1254/11)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: In launching the review of the regional  transportation strategy, I set out my commitment to ensure more sustainable  transport arrangements in providing a proper balance between the needs of  people, business and the environment. In support of that review, and recognising  the important role of park-and-ride facilities in promoting sustainable  transport, my Department is carrying out a strategic review of park-and-ride  facilities, including those at rail stations, with the aim of developing  proposals for future provision that offers the best prospects for encouraging  modal shift. Although funding for park-and-ride development has been secured,  the review is ongoing and final decisions have not yet been made.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My Department&rsquo;s investment in rail transport has been as  follows. From 2001-02 to 2009-2010, we have funded &pound;303 million of capital  works on the railways network. Some major projects include the purchase of new  trains, the first of which arrived today; the construction of a new train care  facility at Fortwilliam; an upgrade of railway lines, such as the Bleach Green  to Whitehead line; construction of a new railway station at Newry; a track-life  extension project on the rail line between Ballymena and Derry; and  improvements to stations and halts across the network that bring them into line  with disability discrimination action legislation. In the current Budget, we  expect to see the delivery of 20 new trains, as well as the construction of a  new stabling facility and an extension of some platforms across the network to accommodate  the new trains. That investment has resulted in more comfortable and reliable  services and has led to a 60% increase in passenger journeys between 2001-02  and 2009-2010 across the local railway network. That totals over 10 million  journeys annually.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his response.  What sustainable rail projects is the Department planning over the next  comprehensive spending review period, from 2011 to 2015?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: Final Budget figures give allocations for railway  capital of &pound;92&middot;1 million, &pound;18&middot;6 million, &pound;11&middot;3 million and &pound;30&middot;4 million over  the four years of the Budget period. The bulk of funding will be used to pay  for the purchase of 20 new class 4000 trains and projects associated with the  introduction of service to new trains, such as the extension of some platforms  on the railway network and the construction of a new train care facility at Adelaide station.  Essential safety-related work will be taken forward, leaving the remainder of  the funding to finance other high priority railway improvement projects,  including essential safety.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Budget makes provision for the commencement of the  Coleraine to Derry track relay in 2014-15, an overhaul of class 3000 trains and  Enterprise trains, as well as work at Ballymoney footbridge and Antrim bus and  rail station.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Campbell</strong>:  The Minister referred to the Coleraine to Londonderry  line. Will he ensure that Translink and the Department examine very closely the  need for passing loops in the Ballykelly area to ensure that more than one  train can transport between Coleraine and Londonderry, rather than the Londonderry train having to wait until the Coleraine  train has arrived?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: That is part of the scheme. Obviously, there has been  a very lengthy assessment over the past number of years, of which the Member  will be familiar, into what is required and where exactly the passing loop  would be. There have been differing arguments, and it will come down to a  technical decision and assessment of where the best place for a passing loop  is. However, the intention is to keep the Derry to Coleraine railway track  open, because the clear advice from Translink and its engineers is that, should  we not invest in that line over the next four years, that would lead to the  closure of the Derry-Coleraine line. The clear intention is to keep that open,  make a very significant investment of more than &pound;70 million, improve the  service between Derry and Belfast and allow  commuters to get into Derry before 9.00 am for  the first time.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  I join the Minister in welcoming the arrival of the new trains and the capital  investment in that new rolling stock. What assurances can the Minister offer  the House that the Dublin-Belfast Enterprise service will be improved during  this CSR period and that we will reverse the fact that, in certain parts of  that service, train speeds are slower today than they were during the Second  World War?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I am glad that the Member welcomes the new trains  that arrived today. He has issued a statement saying that some of them will be  mothballed, but, yet again, he is incorrect. The new trains will be put into  service in their entirety by the end of next year. It would probably have been  better if he had welcomed the new trains without trying to put a negative slant  on the issue. I assure him that all 20 of the new trains will be put into service.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We will continue to invest in the Dublin-Belfast Enterprise  service. Through the work of the North/South Ministerial Council, we have  assessed a broad range of improvements up to a very high end, which could  require investment of anything up to about &pound;1 billion. Some of the improvements  relate to the issue at Knockmore, which causes a delay of about three or four  minutes in the journey between Belfast and Dublin. Some of the other  significant work relates to congestion issues north of Connolly station, for  which the Dublin  Government are also struggling to find investment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have agreed a programme of incremental improvements  around the reliability of the trains themselves, the service provided and the  introduction of Wi-Fi on the train service. We have already introduced a stop  at Lisburn. At the end of this month, we will introduce a stop where the early  morning commuter service goes from Newry to Dublin,  rather than from Dundalk to Dublin.  That will attract more passengers. The programme to incrementally improve the  service will involve work with both Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and Northern Ireland  Railways. If Budgets North and South will allow it, the aspiration is still to  make much more significant improvements and follow through on the Enterprise  2020 vision, whereby we have an hourly service and reduce the journey time.</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">A5 Dual Carriageway</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">3. <strong>Lord  Morrow </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development what discussions he has  had with the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development and the Minister of  the Environment in relation to the impact of the proposed A5 road scheme on the  farming community and the environment. (AQO 1255/11)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I have had discussions with the Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development on road schemes in general. Similar  underlying issues apply across all major road schemes, including the A5  dualling project. The Minister raised a number of concerns with me regarding  issues affecting the farming community, particularly concerns regarding the  impacts on farms and communications. I assured the Minister that those impacts  were being minimised as far as practicable and that there has been widespread  consultation with affected farmers throughout the entire process. I have not  had a direct discussion with the Minister of the Environment regarding the A5  project, although my Department&rsquo;s Roads Service and its scheme consultants have  had very useful discussions with officials from the Department of the  Environment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The A5 project has wider benefits for the region. Roads  Service is working towards providing the best solution when considered against  all standard assessment criteria, which include economic, engineering,  integration, accessibility and environment issues. Both the Department of  Agriculture and the Department of the Environment have had major influence on  the route selection. When consulted as part of the formal consultation process,  they responded by highlighting issues to be considered during the further  development of the scheme.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his reply, but it strikes me that there is no  joined-up thinking on such a major road scheme that will have a detrimental  impact on the environment. Indeed, we discover that the Minister has never  spoken his counterpart in the Department of the Environment about it. Will he  take that on board and make it his business to have a meeting with the  Department of the Environment to ascertain its views and how it feels the  scheme will impact the environment in that locality?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I have no issue with talking to the Minister of the  Environment about it. Probably no other Department, outside of DRD, has more of  an input into major construction schemes than the Department of the  Environment, which, obviously, has planning responsibilities. The environmental  statement crafted in relation to the A5, which will be subject to public  inquiry, was done so in consultation with the Department of the Environment.  There has been no shortage of consultation on, and discussion and assessment  of, the route options. The two Departments that had most input into the  selection of the preferred route were DARD and DOE. One of the criteria for  selection is environmental impact. As I said, I have no issue with talking to  the Minister of the Environment, but I am not sure that our talking together  would add much light to the situation, whereas properly qualified officials in  both Departments have been in regular contact since the inception of the  scheme.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his answer.  What mitigation measures are proposed for the scheme?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: The environmental statement was published in November  2010 along with the draft vesting and direction orders. The statement outlines  the proposed mitigation measures to protect the environment, including  planting, screening, wildlife and fauna provision and pollution prevention  measures. The formal consultation process for the scheme ended on 21 January 2011,  and issues that are raised in relation to the proposed mitigation and access to  farmland will be heard at the scheme&rsquo;s public inquiry, which is scheduled for 9  May 2011. More detailed accommodation works will be discussed with individual  landowners when the scheme is defined following the outcome of the public  inquiry. Impacts that are not mitigated may be addressed through compensation,  which, if necessary, would be a matter for the Department of Finance and  Personnel through the Lands Tribunal.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Savage</strong>: I  have listened carefully to the Minister&rsquo;s answers. My party and I have been  inundated with representations from farmers, homeowners and commuters concerned  about the A5 proposal. Will the Minister detail why his Department feels it  necessary to build a completely new dual carriageway through virgin countryside  instead of updating the existing road?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I do not think that it would be possible to update  the existing road to a dual carriageway. Like me, the Member regularly travels  on the A1, and he will know that it has probably cost more to put safety works  along the A1, including new flyovers and stopping-up junctions, than it cost to  build the A1 in the first place. Building a road with so many access points will  not create the standard of dual carriageway that, it has been agreed, is  necessary to service the north-west, not just in the Derry  area but into Donegal as well. A high standard dual carriageway has to be taken  off the line of the existing road.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I understand the issues that farmers have; the same issues  arose with the A4, the Newry to Dundalk road  and the Newry bypass. All major road projects will have an impact on virgin  farmland if they go off the line of the existing road. It is a difficult issue,  and that is why it takes such a long time to work the issues through with local  farmers to ensure that people are properly compensated for any lands that are  taken and that proper mitigation measures are put in place to allow people, in  the case of a farm that is split in two, to have access either side of the  road. If we want to create connections between major cities on the island of Ireland, that is the approach that we  need to take.</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">NI Water: Procurement</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">4. <strong>Mr  Molloy </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development for his assessment of  the procurement failures identified in the Public Accounts Committee&rsquo;s report  &lsquo;Measuring the Performance of NI Water and Procurement and Governance in NI  Water&rsquo;. (AQO 1256/11)</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">NI Water: PAC Report</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">7. <strong>Mrs D  Kelly </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development for his assessment of the  Public Accounts Committee&rsquo;s report &lsquo;Measuring the Performance of NI Water and  Procurement and Governance in NI Water&rsquo;. (AQO 1259/11)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I will  reply to questions 4 and 7 together.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It would be inappropriate for me to comment in detail on  the Public Accounts Committee&rsquo;s findings at this time. My Department will  consider the report and contribute to the official Government response. In line  with established protocol and procedures, that will take the form of a  memorandum of reply, which is laid before the Assembly by the Minister of  Finance and Personnel.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>:  What positives have there been in NI Water over the past years? Will the  outcome of the report mean that businesses that have been working with the  water service will continue to be able to get contracts?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: More often than not, I have been to the Assembly to  give negative answers about NIW issues, but there have been many unremarked-on  positives. NIW has received &pound;1 billion in capital investment from the Executive  over the past four years. The vast bulk of those construction schemes have been  completed to a very high standard, on target and on budget, and they have made  a significant improvement. Many Members will know that, having lobbied on  planning restrictions and the availability of sewage treatment works and the  like, there has been a significant improvement.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The investment has helped to move us further away from the  position that we were in four years ago when the Department and the Executive  were on the verge of incurring infraction costs for pollution issues. NIW&rsquo;s  work has resulted in significant positive outcomes, on the back of a protracted  period of neglect of the water and sewerage infrastructure. There has been a  sea change in how contracts are procured and in the standards that are  expected, and not just in NIW. My opinion, from talking to people in other  Departments, is that the experience of the procurement issues in NIW has led to  a general tightening up across the public sector, which is to be welcomed. I  believe that contractors and others who tender to provide services to NIW and  other public sector outfits and Departments have more confidence about being on  a level playing field than they might have had before.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  Question 7, please, Mr Speaker.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: Mr Speaker, I have just answered questions 4 and 7  together.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I will make it clear to the House. Mrs Kelly, your question was grouped with  question 4, so you are allowed to ask a supplementary question.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I apologise, Mr Speaker. I am sure that the Minister is by now well aware of  the damage caused to the reputation of the directors whom he sacked on the back  of a flawed report by an independent review committee, which has now been  totally discredited. Will the Minister take this opportunity to apologise to  Declan Gormley and the others whom he sacked?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: The report clearly confirmed that there was a culture  of disregard for procurement processes in NIW, which led to serious failings in  procurement procedures totalling &pound;46 million. That was not challenged by the  Public Accounts Committee. I think that this is a matter on public record,  although I am unable to respond in any great detail.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Members of the Member&rsquo;s party sat on the Public Accounts  Committee. I am surprised that no conflict of interest issues arose as a result  of that, because while two of her party colleagues sat on the Public Accounts  Committee, they continued to lobby for the reinstatement of directors who were  dismissed as a consequence of a report that established that there was a  culture of serious disregard for procurement processes. That has not been  challenged by the Public Accounts Committee. In light of that, I am not sure  how her party has the brass neck to continue to lobby for those directors to be  reinstated, and I would question, in relation to &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  No apology, then?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: Mr McDevitt is asking for an apology.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. Allow the Minister to continue.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I think that Members who sit on a Public Accounts  Committee inquiring into these matters, while privately lobbying for the very  people who are the subject of the inquiry, should perhaps owe an apology to the  other members of the Public Accounts Committee. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. Allow the Minister to continue.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I think that an apology might be due on that given  that a member of the Public Accounts Committee submitted questions to that  Committee in his name as part of that investigation. Those questions were  previously refused under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 by the Department  when Mr Gormley submitted them, and they then reappeared in the name of a  member of the Public Accounts Committee, who submitted them to the Committee  investigation into the matter. That leads to serious concerns. In the face of  evidence of procurement failings, given the persistent lobbying of the SDLP  Members for apologies and reinstatement for those people, I would ask whether  that party needs to declare any conflict of interest in relation to that issue.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>: I  am cautious about speaking about severe weather conditions on a day when our  thoughts and prayers are with the people of Japan, who most readily know the  effect of the severity of weather. However, whatever difficulties and failures  there have been in the past, the public want to know whether the Minister is  satisfied that we are fit for purpose to tackle those conditions more  effectively than we did in December and January if we were again to face such  conditions, which were the worst for 120 years.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I have received assurances about short-term  resilience measures that NIW has already put in place, so I am satisfied that  those conditions would be tackled more effectively. However, I am not  completely satisfied that we would not have a recurrence of any type of  incident in such severe weather again.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Last week, I spoke to the Assembly about a report that  contains some 60 recommendations. I want the implementation of those  recommendations to be completely satisfied. I am satisfied that there has been  a significant improvement. However, I want to get to a stage at which we are  prepared for the unexpected as well as the expected. As the Member quite  rightly said, given the experience in Japan and elsewhere, the weather  can throw conditions at people with which no system can cope.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want those 60 recommendations to be worked through. When  the Executive discussed the issue last Thursday, they asked that a regular  report be made to them about the implementation of those recommendations and  issues that the regulator pointed out in his report. I think that there will be  ongoing very close scrutiny not only from the public and Members but from the  Executive and from me, or whoever becomes the Minister for Regional Development  after the election, to make sure that the lessons are very clearly learned and  that the recommendations that have been put forward by the regulator are put in  place.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  The Minister touched on the tightening up of procurement irregularities. I am  sure that he is aware that those occurred as far back as the time of the Water  Service. Does he acknowledge that senior civil servants must also accept a  level of responsibility for the issue?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I do not think that senior civil servants were  responsible for the culture of disregard of proper procurement procedures. I am  a former Deputy Chairperson of the Public Accounts Committee, and I do not  think that there is a Public Accounts Committee report that does not challenge  civil servants, which is quite correct. In this case, the report also  challenges the Department to make sure that it carries out its procedures in a  very efficient, effective and upfront way. I do not doubt that there are  lessons to be learned. As I indicated, the response to the report will  obviously be worked out through the normal processes of responding to a Public  Accounts Committee report, but there are challenges for the Department in that.  It still does not underline the fact that unacceptable practices were going on  in NIW. It is not unique in that regard, but, as painful and difficult as the  issue has been, it has shone a light on procurement processes across the public  sector. I hope that we see a significant improvement right across the public  sector as a result.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Water: Governance</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">5. <strong>Ms S  Ramsey </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development for his assessment of the  Regional Development Committee&rsquo;s decision to reject his proposed short-term  water governance legislative arrangements. (AQO 1257/11)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: Naturally, I am disappointed by the Committee&rsquo;s  decision. The Committee seemed to agree that the Bill cannot be progressed  other than by accelerated passage and that it would take some time &mdash; years,  indeed &mdash; to make fundamental changes to water governance structures. The  Committee also seemed to support working level agreements and MOUs in a revised  governance letter that reflected the predominance of public expenditure  controls. However, the majority of members of the Committee do not support  providing a legislative basis for the arrangements that they seem to support at  a working level and a funding regime that they appear to agree is inevitable. I  can only suppose that there is an unstated desire to leave open the possibility  of introducing arrangements other than public funding of water and sewerage  services in the short term. However, that is not feasible as it would take some  time to implement any self-funding arrangements and the Executive Budget does  not anticipate additional revenue from water. There can be no doubt that water  and sewerage services must be majority public funded in the short term &mdash; the  period that is covered by the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The interim measures in the Bill would help to stabilise  the governance arrangements during the period by providing my Department with  the temporary powers necessary to ensure that NIW complies with public  expenditure controls and disciplines. The Bill would not prevent the  consideration of more fundamental changes to governance arrangements, and I  have advised the Assembly that I plan to shortly bring forward proposals to  deal with longer-term governance.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I have listened to the Minister&rsquo;s  response to my question and to the answers that he gave to previous questions.  It shows that there is a need for change. Some parties have argued for the need  for immediate change and then, as you highlighted, rejected the changes at  Committee. You have given some sense of the importance of the changes, but will  you expand on the importance of the immediate changes that are needed?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I agree with the Member that change is necessary. It  seems that most parties agree that change is necessary. The problem is that,  when it comes to making the change, a degree of cold feet appears to enter the  equation at that stage. In relation to the specific proposals in the Bill for  which I requested accelerated passage, the need for the changes arises because  the existing go-co governance structure is at odds with the continued majority  public funding of water and sewerage services. The proposals will ensure that  public expenditure considerations retain precedence. The hybrid system of  governance has led to risks and complexity that are not sustainable. Currently,  two models are operating at the same time: a regulated utility model, funded by  customer payments and a public sector model, which is funded by Government. The  legal status of NIW, as set out in the Water and Sewerage Services Order 2006,  reflects the former position and the financial position reflects the latter  because Treasury classifies NIW as a non-departmental public body. Those are  the complexities that could have been resolved in the short term by  legislation, but it does not seem that that legislation will prove to be  doable.<span class="SectionMarker"><span style="font-size:14.0pt; "> </span></span></p>

    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Housing: East   Londonderry</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">1. <strong>Mr G  Robinson </strong>asked the Minister for Social Development what expenditure is  planned for newbuild projects in the East Londonderry  constituency in 2011-12 and 2012-13. (AQO 1268/11)</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Housing: South   Antrim</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">3. <strong>Mr T  Clarke </strong>asked the Minister for Social Development what housing projects are  planned for the South Antrim area in the next  financial year. (AQO 1270/11)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development (Mr Attwood)</strong>: With your permission, Mr Speaker, I will  answer questions 1 and 3 together.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The answer to Mr Robinson&rsquo;s question is that it is still a  work in progress. When the Housing Executive comes to me with its draft  programme for newbuild over the next number of years, I will be in a position  to confirm what might be intended for any area of Northern Ireland. If that happens  on the far side of the start of purdah, I will lodge that information in the  Assembly Library.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Robinson</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answer. Will he outline the policies that he is  following to maximise investment in the public sector?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I would like to maximise investment in the public  housing sector. However, as I said during the Final Stage debate on the Housing  (Amendment) Bill, Northern Ireland needs 2,500 houses  a year to be built to meet demand. In such a situation, the decision of the  Executive and the Assembly to reduce newbuild housing over the next four years  to 1,200 or 1,300 means that there will not be sufficient investment in public  housing. The number of those in housing need and housing stress will increase,  and all that will happen in the context of people losing their homes, having  less money, less welfare and fewer jobs. It is not a healthy environment in  which to go forward. On the far side of the election, I hope that people will  think more wisely of the judgements that they made last week.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answer. However, given that he is in the early  stages of going into the next financial year, what plans has he brought  forward? I appreciate that he may not have the money, but what plans did he  have drawn up for newbuild in South Antrim?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: The Member might be aware that a moratorium on capital  newbuild was laid down by the Executive and reported to the Assembly.  Therefore, Ministers had to be very careful going forward. Nonetheless, housing  associations are aware of where housing need is in Northern Ireland and of where  resources should therefore go. That includes each and every area where there is  housing need in Northern    Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Year to year, there may be peaks and troughs in newbuilds  in any given constituency, but, taken over a four- or five-year cycle, the  evidence confirms that newbuild goes to where need is identified. That will  include South Antrim, East Derry or any other  constituency in the North. Given that Margaret Ritchie was able to have 1,800  newbuild starts last year, which I hope to surpass this year, it is critical  that we ask what the consequences will be of any future Social Development  Minister having those top-line figures for newbuild starts cut by 300, 400, 500  or 600. I think that the consequences for people in need are self-evident.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>:  Returning to the subject of East Derry, where the question originated, will the  Minister give a flavour of the work that DSD has done in that constituency  over, say, the past three years?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: In the past three years, there has been an investment  of &pound;6&middot;5 million in newbuilds, which means 60 houses. There has been an  investment of &pound;4&middot;07 million in other housing Executive work in Coleraine and  Limavady. That does not take into account all the other spend of the Department  on voluntary and community and development moneys in East Derry, South Antrim and all the other constituencies. If all  those figures are put together, it can be seen that, when it comes to issues of  need, DSD is showing the way in each and every constituency in Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  Does the Minister have any plans for the unused military homes in South Antrim  or, indeed, anywhere else in Northern    Ireland?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: That is also a work in progress. Mr Kinahan and my  colleague Mr Burns have brought that matter to my attention, and they were  right to do so. Good evidence over the years shows that former military housing  that becomes available to and that can be accessed by the Housing Executive and  housing associations provides good value for money in the housing budget and  meets housing need. Just look at Pond   Park in Lisburn, where  former military housing has gone into the public sector at good value, given  that two housing associations competed for those properties. As a consequence,  housing need in Lisburn has been mitigated. If we are able to do that in other  parts of Northern Ireland,  including in South Antrim, I would encourage  any Minister to go in that direction.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Housing: Girdwood</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">2. <strong>Mr A  Maginness </strong>asked the Minister for Social Development what stage he is at in  developing proposals for housing on the Girdwood site, North   Belfast. (AQO 1269/11)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank the Member for his question. He and other Members  will be aware that I confirmed this morning that, following a lot of work over  the past six months, 200 public sector newbuild houses will be built on the  part of the Girdwood site that is appropriate for newbuild housing. I confirm  that, over the past months, a housing association was appointed to take forward  that work and a design competition was run. A design outcome was agreed, and it  has now been worked up to the point where a planning application could be made  in the next two months. As a consequence, the acute housing need in North Belfast will be addressed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I know that there are issues, sensitivities, concerns and  anxieties around the Girdwood site, but this should not be a zero-sum game. It  should not be the case that a gain for nationalists is a loss for unionists and  a gain for unionists is a loss for nationalists. That is zero-sum politics. We  should have the maturity and wisdom to move beyond that. In the lower Shankill,  lower Oldpark, Mountainview and Girdwood areas, that is the way to go.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I thank the Minister for the very good news for the long-suffering people of North Belfast who have suffered long waiting lists and  acute housing need. That very good news is thanks to a Minister who actually  delivers.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">What other housing projects are being undertaken or are  under consideration in North Belfast?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: If I may go back to the Girdwood issue, I must ask  Members across the parties in the Chamber some simple questions. If we are able  to build housing on land that we own with money that we have for needs that  exist, whether it is for unionists or nationalists, will people please explain  to me why we are not in a phase of our history where we should go down that  road? If we cannot do that in the lower Shankill, lower Oldpark, Mountainview,  Girdwood, or other parts of north or west Belfast, where some of the most acute  housing need exists, I do not understand why, when we have a level of political  stability in this Chamber and greater stability in the community, we are not at  a stage of development where we are mature and wise enough to go in that  direction. I believe that we are. The message that I get from unionism and  nationalism on the ground is that that is where we want to go.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Humphrey</strong>:  Earlier this morning, I spent some time in the lower Oldpark area with the  Moderator of the Presbyterian Church prior to the Minister&rsquo;s announcement that  200 homes would be built at the Girdwood site. It is very clear that the  Minister has abandoned the concept of a shared space, a shared future and a  shared site, as set out in the report by Dunlop and Toner. Today, the Oldpark  community feels fearful, angry and betrayed. It has made absolutely no gain.  Does the Minister accept that the concept outlined today can happen only with  intercommunity and Executive approval?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I will deal with the latter point first. The Member and  others have to ask themselves a simple question: why was it that the proposed  conflict transformation centre at Long Kesh was not a matter that the DUP  considered to be controversial enough to be brought to the Executive table?  That is what happened last autumn. A conflict transformation centre at the  Maze/Long Kesh site was an issue around which there was a lot of controversy  and concern, and some people thought that it was a partial and exclusive  initiative. However, unionism, in particular the DUP, did not consider it to be  controversial enough to go to the Executive. If that is the case, why do the  same standards not apply to housing for those in need in Girdwood? When it  comes to standards, you cannot pick and choose. In my view, what was  demonstrated in respect of the Maze &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: &mdash; was maturity beginning to grow in this society, and I  believe that the same maturity will grow in respect of housing in north Belfast.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Shared housing is the preferred option, but are we saying  that, four or five years after the development of master plans for Girdwood,  when housing need is so high, nothing should happen pending the future  development of the Girdwood site? I do not think so. In any case, as the Member  is fully aware, over the past six months, I have demonstrated that money should  go where there is housing need, such as to the lower Shankill, the lower  Oldpark and Mountainview. Government should go there, and that is where this  Minister will go.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Members should continue to rise in their place.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s announcement  that 200 houses will be built at Girdwood, and I know that a housing  association has been appointed to oversee that development. Will the Minister  give us a completion date for the houses?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank the Member for his question. I spoke to the  housing association&rsquo;s development team this morning. As I indicated, the  planning application is being developed. It is anticipated that it will go to  the Planning Service within two or three months and that, subject to planning  consents and approvals, planning permission should be granted within, let us  say, another four months. Consequently, before the beginning of the next  financial year and, in my view, within ten months, builders will be on site and  building will have commenced.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I remind Members that question 3 has already been answered.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Mixed Housing</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">4. <strong>Mr Lunn </strong>asked the Minister for Social Development for an update on the development  of mixed housing. (AQO 1271/11)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank the Member for his question. I confirm that  there are a number of parallel initiatives in the Department to take forward  the development of mixed housing. First, all newbuilds are deemed to be shared  schemes so that people try to live up to the aspiration of all newbuilds being  shared schemes. Secondly, when the Housing Executive consults tenants, it asks  them explicitly whether they would like to live in a shared neighbourhood. As  the Member is aware, we now have a situation in Northern Ireland where 30 existing  areas, with a population of 90,000 people, are deemed to be shared  neighbourhoods. During the next number of months, I hope to announce that there  will be a common landlord area in Belfast,  whereby those who want to live in shared housing will have the opportunity to  do so. Over and above all that, the Housing Executive, working with the Rural  Development Council, has recently acquired through Peace III significant  millions of pounds in an effort to drive forward the concept and practice of  shared housing.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his answer. I understand that the International Fund for  Ireland  has been quite heavily involved in funding those schemes. I also understand  that the US Congress is to stop funding the IFI. Will that have a dramatic  effect on the future of those schemes?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank the Member for his question. He is quite right  to acknowledge the IFI&rsquo;s role in the shared neighbourhood scheme. It has been an  essential partner &mdash; financially and in other ways &mdash; in taking the initiative  forward. I wish to correct an error that I made: 70,000 rather than 90,000  people now live in the 30 areas. I understand that contact with the American  Congress is ongoing in an effort to ensure that funding for the IFI might yet  be made available.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  Will the Minister outline his position on shared housing? Furthermore, in the  future, what is his Department&rsquo;s position on shared housing likely to be?</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I acknowledge the Member&rsquo;s final point about the  future. There is a sense that, although we now have a more settled form of  devolution, sharing responsibility at the heart of government is a necessary  co-existence rather than a value and ethic driven into and embedded in the way  that we conduct our business. If our society is to go forward, it must be  without prejudice to the national aspirations of any one Member or community  and without prejudice to whatever choices the people in the North of Ireland  and on the island   of Ireland make on the  future constitutional position. We will be a better, more enriched and more  diverse people the more that we adopt a shared approach and a common way of  doing business in government, in our communities &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  In education.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: Yes, indeed, potentially in education also. I will not  shirk that issue. Society and we, as political leader, must ask ourselves  questions about shared schools and how they make sense economically. Shared  schools may be an economic imperative, and they may also be part of how society  develops in the image of something better than what went before. That need not  diminish in any shape or form the great achievements of all the schooling sectors  in Northern Ireland,  including the state, Catholic and integrated sectors. The challenge that faces  us is whether we, as a political leadership, can embed the standards of a  shared and common approach in all that we say and do in a way that characterises  the next Government as different from the previous one.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Social Investment Fund</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">5. <strong>Mr  McGlone </strong>asked the Minister for Social Development for his assessment of the  governance arrangements for the social investment fund. (AQO 1272/11)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I have difficulty answering that question because, as I  have said repeatedly, today &mdash; the best part of a week after the Budget was  endorsed by the Assembly and the best part of two weeks after it was endorsed  by the Executive &mdash; we still do not know how it will be targeted, what criteria  will be applied and how decisions will be made. We do know that the First  Minister and deputy First Minister have failed to consult other Ministers,  government officials and the community and voluntary sector generally. As a  consequence, there is much speculation without any concrete details. That is  not a healthy way to go forward. That is why, on Friday of last week, I wrote  to the First Minister and deputy First Minister. Now that there is an &pound;80  million fund for the next four years, I outlined my view on what the shape and  character of that fund should be to enable it to achieve what it should, which  is to tackle need and disadvantage over that period.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  In many ways, the Minister answered the question about the slush/secrecy fund.  He may well give the same answer to my next question. Is he in a position to  establish or set priorities in his Department for any form of spending under  the social investment fund, be it collaborative or internal to the Department?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: It might be helpful to indicate in broad terms what the  priorities should be. In my view, neighbourhood renewal is the preferred  programme for tackling disadvantage in areas of need in Northern Ireland,  and it was unanimously endorsed by the Assembly in a recent motion. Over the  past number of weeks, I have directed an increasing percentage of moneys  towards those in the nought-to three and three-to-six age groups. In any effort  to give families and children the best opportunities, intervention at the  earliest possible stage is the best strategy. It is a way of ensuring that, in  the period between childhood and adulthood, there is less risk and less danger  to them and to the communities in which they live. Therefore, given that young  children come to school and do not know how to hold a pencil, nurture classes  and primary 1 classes are a priority. It seems to me that a way to go forward  is to use the integrated services initiative in west Belfast  and north Belfast  to help people who live in difficult circumstances with children who behave in  a difficult manner. The GRIT project gives the opportunity to those aged 16 and  older who are not in education, training or work and who, in many instances,  have dropped out of the system, to improve their skills and increase their  self-esteem. Those are examples of where money is spent on vital interventions  in areas of need. In that context, I wrote to the First Minister and deputy  First Minister on those specific proposals.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  I am delighted to know that the Minister is also in the dark about some of  those arrangements. He will know that my party has some concerns about the  social investment fund and how it might be administered. Can he indicate  whether there will be measures in that fund that will deal specifically with  small pockets of deprivation?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I simply do not know whether the social investment fund  will do that. I have said that the family of neighbourhood renewal interventions,  which includes neighbourhood renewal funding, SPOD funding and communities at  risk, is ring-fenced. Indeed, as I said previously, the current baseline  funding on the revenue side will be enhanced. There is an ongoing process of  evaluation, and announcements will be made in the very near future.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his  pre-election speech in response to Mr McGlone&rsquo;s question. Given his repeated  commitment to the most vulnerable in society, why was he proposing the  scrapping of the social investment fund, which was his party&rsquo;s position in last  week&rsquo;s Budget debate? Is that really the best way of defending the most  vulnerable in our society?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I always find it quite curious how other parties reduce  everything to electioneering and to the lowest common denominator.<span class="Italic"> [Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: It is revealing of other parties that the words that  come out of their mouths most quickly on any matter to do with the Budget or  how we go forward over the next four years are reduced to the language of  electioneering. It says everything about what they say and little about what  others might say.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Speaker, let me ask Mr McLaughlin about the social  investment fund. Has he seen a scrap of paper about how that &pound;80 million has  been spent? Has he been in any meetings with people up in Derry  in respect of how the money might be spent? Is he satisfied that he put his  hand up for an &pound;80 million fund without any detail, budget line, information,  application process or any sense of what it should really mean? Is he saying  that, when DSD is responsible for neighbourhood renewal as the flagship  programme to tackle disadvantage, DSD &mdash; never mind the Department of Health,  Social Services and Public Safety, the Department of Education or any other  Department &mdash; should be completely unsighted on that proposal?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Of course I support money going into areas of need, and  that is why I have protected the budget line for neighbourhood renewal. Indeed,  I have enhanced it. However, there is a difference between helping people in  need and helping those in the know. It seems that the social investment fund is  very much about helping those in the know and not about helping those in need.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Village, Belfast: Regeneration</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">6. <strong>Mr  Spratt </strong>asked the Minister for Social Development for an update on the  regeneration of the Village area in Belfast.  (AQO 1273/11)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank the Member for his question. A community design  team that includes 10 local residents is now working through the design of the  new Village in the event that the scheme proceeds. It has met on a number of  occasions, and I understand that it will meet again this month. It is having  discussions around a draft concept plan, a phasing plan and how to build  eco-efficiency into the new properties. It is anticipated that a formal design  team will be in place by 2011.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In parallel to all that &mdash; this is what Mr Spratt may  rightly be concerned about &mdash; is the fact that 60 properties in the Village are  in negative equity, with an average negative equity of &pound;50,000. I continue to  explore that issue with the Attorney General, and a meeting is scheduled for  next week in an effort to identify whether any legal obligation falls to the  Executive in relation to vesting, given that the sale of a person&rsquo;s property is  happening without their consent.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At the same time, there continues to be conversations with  the Council of Mortgage Lenders to help property owners to flip their  properties with their existing mortgage in respect of a different property in a  different location in order to ensure that they can move out of their property,  that vesting can go ahead, and that they can continue to deploy their existing  mortgage on a new property in a different place, without the consequences of  negative equity that are being visited upon the people in the Village.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Spratt</strong>:  We have now established that this morning&rsquo;s announcement about Girdwood army  base was not an electioneering ploy. The Minister has acknowledged that people  are in negative equity, but will he give some indication as to when building  may start in the Village, as the people there have been long-suffering? They  have seen their whole area devastated, and there are people in that area who  want to continue to live there.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank the Member for his question. The Housing  Executive has vested 534 properties in the redevelopment area. Some 338 have  been vacated and are blocked up, while 196 still require to be relocated. To  answer the question more specifically, there were properties built by the Fold  Housing Association at Roden    Street that were overspill. I inspected them some  time ago, and they are of a very high standard and add to the character and  quality of housing in that area. I know that Mr Spratt will agree with me on  that. That has resulted in the Housing Executive relocating households from the  immediate clearance area into those properties, with the consequence that  demolition in that area is expected in the next four to six weeks.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In respect of Mr Spratt&rsquo;s first comment, I could have moved  some time ago on the housing at Girdwood, but I knew about the anxieties and  issues in that neighbourhood. Therefore, as his colleague Mr Humphrey, who is  sitting next to him, will be aware &mdash; I see Mr Humphrey is shaking his head &mdash;  over the past three or four months, I have heard from residents and political  representatives in lower Oldpark and from the community in the lower Shankill  last July, and, as a consequence of that, mini master plans were developed for  those areas. There have never been mini master plans like those that the  Housing Executive and DSD have produced. I accepted that those areas have been  neglected, that there are needs in those areas, that the people have suffered  disproportionately during the years of conflict, and that there is a  responsibility for the Government to step up to the mark. Therefore, I tried to  put my authority where my mouth was, and now I am trying to put my money where  my mouth is in respect of all those areas, and Girdwood deserves no less.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  I join with Mr Spratt in welcoming the progress that has been made in the  Village, and I acknowledge the Minister&rsquo;s efforts to try to address the  minority of people who are caught in negative equity. As it is his last time  before the House, I thank him for his efforts generally since he became  Minister. What is the status of DSD regeneration in other live urban renewal  areas in Northern Ireland?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: The Member will be interested to know that when I was  not down here voting for the Budget last Wednesday, I was upstairs meeting all  my officials from the Department for Regional Development and from Belfast to discuss public regeneration across Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>:  It was time well spent.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I agree with Mr Dallat; it was time well spent. My  belief, and I think that it is a growing view across Northern Ireland, is that  investment in town centre and urban regeneration on a pound-for-pound basis and  on a job-for-job basis is arguably as good an economic tool as any other  economic investment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Given that fact, I met officials in an effort to drill down  to see how we would spend the money that was allocated in the Budget, on which  Members voted last Wednesday, and how it would be rolled out in an effort to  regenerate town centres, neighbourhoods and cities.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to make a final point. As we go into the next CSR  period, it is not only time that the practice of urban and town centre renewal  be more fully acknowledged as an economic driver but time that we begin to  develop neighbourhoods in cities and towns, not just their centres. In that  way, there can be balanced development of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s towns and  cities, urban and rural areas, neighbourhoods and town centres. That is the  best way to go forward.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Adjourned at 3.31 pm.</p></td>
