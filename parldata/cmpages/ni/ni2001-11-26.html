                inform the House that I received a package similar to the
                aforementioned package at my home on Saturday morning. I called
                out the police and the Fire Brigade. I have also received 10
                anonymous letters. Since 2 November, the police have been at my
                house more times than in my entire life. I ask whoever is

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The House is concerned about harassment of
                any of its Members. Although the Member says that she has
                received a similar package, that may not be the case. It is not
                clear what the package received here contains. The package
                raised health concerns rather than security concerns.</p>

                expresses its abhorrence of the attacks on Ms Armitage.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a further point of order, Mr Speaker. Do
                you consider the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development’s
                non-attendance and the absence of a statement on the
                non-prosecution of fraudulent sheep subsidy claimants to be a
                matter of contempt?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order. The Member will resume his seat. He is
                not making a point of order; he already knows the answer. It is
                for Ministers to decide whether they wish to speak. The Member
                is making a point of politics. He ought not to enter into
                matters of that kind. Points of order are not to be used to
                raise points of politics, although that is frequently the case.</p>

              Enterprise, Trade and Investment (Mr Neeson):</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee for Enterprise, Trade and
              Investment has not tabled any amendments and is therefore
              supporting the Bill. I thank the Minister, his officials,
              Committee members and staff for their contribution to the
              production of the report.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee had some concerns about the
              system of appointments to the board. Many public appointments fall
              outside the scope of anti-discrimination legislation because they
              are made by, or under the authority of, Ministers. That problem is
              not unique to the board of Invest Northern Ireland. Anyone holding
              a statutory office — that includes many public appointments,
              such as those proposed in the Bill — is not protected by the
              employment provisions in the current employment legislation. That
              means that such people could not, for example, bring any action
              alleging religious, political or other unlawful discrimination in
              relation to appointment or non-appointment, treatment during
              service, termination of appointment or victimisation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many public appointments or statutory offices
              involve a considerable amount of work and carry appropriate levels
              of remuneration. They are usually advertised in employment
              listings, and appointments follow a competitive procedure. They
              often involve working to a set job description. Salaries are paid
              and are subject to tax and national insurance, and in many other
              ways such posts are comparable to ordinary employment. The
              Committee believes that it is right that people holding public
              service posts of that type should not be given a lesser degree of
              protection from discrimination.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It would be preferable — to enhance public
              confidence and having regard to the duties imposed by section 75
              of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 — if Ministers and Departments
              were able to offer a full and public defence against any
              accusation of unlawful discrimination. There should be no need for
              Ministers to shelter behind special protection. It is to be hoped
              that Members will have the opportunity to debate the issue in more
              detail when the single equality Bill comes before the House.</p>

              Committee’s concern on the issue raised by schedule 1, but the

              matter for the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy
              Minister to consider, given that Department’s responsibility for
              anti-discrimination legislation and public appointments. I will

              the language of 1928 — of the Irish hare. I am not putting a
              case against blood sports or putting a case for country sports. My
              amendments make the case for the conservation of a mammal that is
              severely under threat from numerous quarters.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This morning, many Members will have received
              an e-mail from the League Against Cruel Sports. I wish to quote
              one section from that:</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The Burns Inquiry, set up in England and
              Wales, to examine the question of hunting with dogs, said:</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">‘There is understandable concern that the
              seasons for hare coursing and hunting are too long in relation to
              the hare’s breeding season. In the absence of a ban on hunting,
              an option would be to introduce a closed season.’ &quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is what I seek to do.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Before I outline the general case and discuss
              the detail of each amendment, it is perhaps necessary to restate
              what my amendments are not concerned with. Last Friday, several
              Members received an e-mail — I believe that a copy was addressed
              to you, Mr Speaker — from the British Association for Shooting
              and Conservation (BASC) that fundamentally misinterpreted two of
              the amendments tabled in my name and that of Mrs Eileen Bell. I
              must refer to that. It appears that BASC, in suggesting that
              amendment No.1 relates to the shooting of partridge and snipe, has
              failed to distinguish between the amendment Bill and the Act that
              it will amend. Amendment No.1 relates solely to section 7(1)(a) of
              the Game Preservation Act (Northern Ireland) 1928, which is solely
              concerned with hares. It does not refer to partridge or snipe.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">BASC made similar erroneous comments about
              amendment No. 6. I am happy to confirm that after I pointed that
              out, I received an apology by e-mail this morning. Sadly, the
              apology appears to have come to me alone, even though the initial
              allegations were sent to several Members.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is appropriate that I should read to the
              House an e-mail from Mr Gorman of BASC:</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Thank you for clarification of your
              amendment to Clause 1. I am pleased that it doesn’t relate to
              the shooting season for partridges and snipe.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I suspect that Members who received that e-mail
              on Friday can now ignore it. It has been shown to be inaccurate as
              far as it refers to my amendments, as opposed to Mr Leslie’s.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no doubt that the Irish hare is under
              severe threat. In the biodiversity strategy for Northern Ireland,
              which was drawn up by the Northern Ireland Biodiversity Group and
              supported by the Environment and Heritage Service (EHS) of the
              Department of the Environment, the Irish hare is one of only three
              species that have been selected for a specific Northern Ireland
              action plan. The others are the chough and the curlew. The Irish
              hare is the only mammal that is seen as needing its own plan.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The species action plans were published in
              October. Although they included numerous recommendations, no
              action has been taken by the Department of the Environment. There
              is no doubt that field survey was delayed by foot-and-mouth
              disease — a convenient excuse but, nonetheless, valid in this
              case. The best information available is now at least five or six
              years out of date, as it is derived from data collected in a
              survey between 1994 and 1996. I understand that the Department is
              due to start the next survey of hare numbers in the spring of
              2002.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will quote three paragraphs from ‘Northern
              Ireland Species Action Plans’. Paragraph 1.2 says:</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;populations are thought to have undergone
              a substantial decline in the last 10-20 years. … Population
              levels may have fallen to critical levels in some areas.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Paragraph 1.3 says:</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The Irish hare is a quarry species … It
              is listed in Annex V (a) of the EU Directive 92/43/EEC (Habitats
              Directive), which determines that such species may be exploited
              provided that this is compatible with their maintenance at a
              favourable conservation status.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What is a favourable conservation status?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Paragraph 5.1.3 refers to the intention to</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;review and, if necessary, increase the
              level of protection given to the Irish hare in the Wildlife
              (Northern Ireland) Order 1985.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Action was expected on that from the Department
              of the Environment, but, unfortunately, that has not happened.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Environment and Heritage Service’s web
              site lists two papers concerned with the current status of Irish
              hares. One paper examines the distribution of hares in five areas
              of County Antrim and County Down and is incidental to a survey
              being conducted on foxes. The other paper is the PhD thesis and
              associated literature compiled by Dr Karina Dingerkus, under the
              supervision of Dr Ian Montgomery of Queen’s University,
              completed in 1997 and published in the academic journal ‘Game
              and Wildlife’ in September 1997. The thesis examined the
              distribution of hares in 150 areas of 1 sq km throughout Northern
              Ireland — rather greater than the areas considered by the more
              recent paper covering the winter and spring of 1994-95 and
              1995-96. Dr Dingerkus wrote to the Environment Committee in
              January 2001, and I have also had a conversation with her. In ‘Game
              and Wildlife’, the inadequacies of the Department of the
              Environment’s approach are highlighted:</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Again records do appear to be relatively
              similar to the present study&quot; —</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">a study conducted some years ago —</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;however, the present study engaged a
              higher level of effort in the field while both Arnold’s and Ni
              Lamhna’s early efforts were only based on incidental
              records.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In other words, the only in-depth study is
              being disowned and discarded by the Department, which is working
              on anecdotal evidence, and other anecdotal evidence appears to
              confirm the statements made by Dr Dingerkus and Dr Montgomery.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In her letter sent to the Committee in January,
              Dr Dingerkus said that the only thing that the Department had done
              since 1997 was to produce the biodiversity action plan. She said
              that of the 150 sq kms examined, 36% had no evidence of hares.
              Many farmers have spoken of a dramatic decrease in numbers, and
              that was confirmed by the recording of hares as locally extinct in
              over 11% of the areas surveyed. Dr Dingerkus also said that game
              bag records from a century ago showed much higher densities of
              hares and that estimates for Northern Ireland suggested that hare
              numbers could be as low as 8,250. In Dr Dingerkus’s opinion, the
              Irish hare could become extinct in 20 to 30 years. The possible
              extinction of a mammal that is, supposedly, on a protected list
              should be of concern to the Department. However, the matter does
              not seem to have attracted much attention so far. Dr Dingerkus
              also referred to important issues such as habitat management.
              Those issues can be — and are — addressed elsewhere. The final
              paragraph of the letter reads:</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;I would like to urge you and your
              colleagues to do what you can to protect this wonderful
              species.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Everyone in the Chamber should listen to that
              this morning.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee has asked numerous questions of
              the Department in the past year. Departmental staff have appeared
              before the Committee and written numerous responses, although it
              would be difficult to suggest that they replied to the questions
              asked or answered them properly in many cases. I will give the
              House a brief sample. On 2 January 2001, a question was asked
              regarding the returning of hares to the area from which they had
              been taken, which is a Department of the Environment requirement
              under a licence to net for coursing. It was admitted that two
              hares had been taken from Rathlin Island in September 2000. The
              Department subsequently requested that neither of them be released
              on Rathlin, because the two animals could not be identified
              individually and because releasing non-Rathlin hares might cause
              genetic contamination of the local stock. That is a wonderful
              example of how the licences are enforced. The Department makes a
              condition and then asks that it not be enforced, because there are
              further problems.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Paisley Jnr:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Member accept that, at the time, there
              were concerns about diseases coming onto Rathlin Island and that,
              for the safety of the island, it was sensible to diverge from the
              rule?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ford:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I accept that there were good reasons why the
              hares should not have been released back to Rathlin Island when
              their identities were unknown. However, the story suggests that
              the Department cannot enforce the conditions of its own licences.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On 5 September, the Environment Committee was
              told that the Minister had decided that the issue of permits to
              net hares could not be resisted on conservation grounds, because
              the current legislation was inadequate. If that is the case, I
              presume that the Minister will accept the stiffening of the
              legislation by our amendments. If he argues that the legislation
              is inadequate, but does not accept our amendments, there will be
              serious questions about what the Department is up to.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On 4 October, the Committee received
              information from the Department on the status of the second, more
              recent hare survey. The precise phrase used was that the data was
              &quot;collected opportunistically&quot; when a PhD student from
              Queen’s University was surveying the population of foxes. The
              word &quot;opportunistic&quot; may mean &quot;fortunate&quot;, but
              it also suggests that the data was not collected because of
              deliberate action by the Department. Nonetheless, the data seems
              to have been given the same importance as the detailed survey
              conducted some years before.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On 26 October, the Committee received further
              correspondence from the Department, including the following choice
              paragraph:</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Moreover, ecological evidence indicates
              that the main factors limiting the hare population are the
              availability and quality of habitat. This suggests that the loss
              of some hares would soon be compensated for by the natural
              expansion of the population to reoccupy the habitat vacated.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If there were a natural expansion, that would
              appear to be a logical statement. However, since everybody seems
              to accept that there is actually a decrease in the number of
              hares, the Department’s reference to natural expansion clouds
              the issue.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most recently, on 21 November, the Department
              responded to concerns about the damage that might be done to hares
              if they were coursed and then released. The Department had raised
              the concern that the hares’ fecundity might be impaired — in
              other words, they might be unable to breed. The Department now
              seems to be concentrating on the effects of stress on the
              reproduction of the snowshoe hare in North America. The simple
              fact is that the Department cannot say how many hares it expects
              to be affected.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the same letter, there is a reference to the
              Dingerkus and Montgomery study, which, it says, gave the
              Department cause for concern. The final paragraph of the letter
              says that</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;In the Department’s opinion, the
              precautionary principle does not apply here, as we have evidence
              of the probable hare population and evidence that this is not
              threatened by legal hare coursing.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I suggest that there is no valid evidence of
              the numbers and no evidence of the effects of coursing or, more
              particularly, of the attempts to snare hares which then escape,
              perhaps damaged and unable to breed. Typically, the Department has
              failed to follow through on its concerns. It is entirely
              appropriate that the Assembly should give the hare much higher
              conservation status than the Department has been willing to do. I
              will explain the detail of the amendments.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Amendment No 1 is a simple matter of extending
              the close season, taking account of the breeding season for hares.
              It seeks to ensure that if the Act cannot be amended in order to
              provide total protection for hares, maximum protection possible,
              consistent with the seasons, will be applied.</p>

              December.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ford:</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I look forward to a further amendment from my
              colleague at the Further Consideration Stage of the Bill.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Amendment No 5 crucially removes the specific
              exemption that allows coursing to take place during the close
              season. It is illogical to have a close season and then allow
              coursing to take place within that period.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Amendments Nos 6 and 7 are purely consequential
              to amendment No 5. Amendment No 8 is a key amendment that relates
              to the Department’s current powers to authorise snaring or
              netting for coursing. The amendment removes the Department’s
              power to authorise such activity. Amendment No 10 is an amendment
              to the schedule consequential to amendments Nos 5 and 7 being
              agreed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I trust that giving an explanation for the
              amendments has not detained the House too long. I draw the
              attention of the House to a superb cartoon by Ian Knox that
              appeared in ‘The Irish News’ in January 2001, which shows a

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Committee for the
              Environment (Rev Dr William McCrea):</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Before addressing the group of amendments, I
              will refer briefly to the work of the Environment Committee during
              the Committee Stage of the Bill.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee ordered its report on the Game
              Preservation (Amendment) Bill to be printed on 18 October 2001
              after consideration of the Bill at its four meetings during
              September and three in October. The Committee received evidence
              from the British Association for Shooting and Conservation (BASC)
              and the Countryside Alliance Northern Ireland. I particularly
              thank Ronan Gorman of BASC and Will Chambré of the Countryside
              Alliance Northern Ireland for their assistance to the Committee in
              the preparation of its report and for their significant
              contribution to the Minister’s amendment to clause 2 that will
              be considered later.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister and his officials for
              their willingness to listen to the views expressed during
              Committee Stage and for their efficiency in reflecting those views
              in the Minister’s proposed amendments. I stress to the House
              that — as recorded in the Committee’s report — the Committee
              did not propose to bring forward amendments to the clauses of the
              Bill, and it has not done so.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Amendments No 1, No 5, No 6, No 7, No 8 and No
              10 proposed by Mr Ford principally address the lawful taking and
              killing, or destroying, of hares for hunting and coursing under
              the Game Preservation Act (Northern Ireland) 1928.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Chairperson of the Committee for the
              Environment I want to put on record the following: the Committee
              has, for over 12 months, been questioning and opposing the
              Department of the Environment’s practice of issuing licences to
              capture live hares for hare coursing. The Committee has serious
              concerns about the acknowledged decrease in the hare population
              throughout Northern Ireland. However, these specific amendments to
              the Bill before the House, with the exception of the Minister’s
              amendments, were not considered by the Committee, so I cannot give
              the Committee’s views on them.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In conclusion, the Committee received clear
              information to the effect that the Irish hare is an endangered
              species. I have made my concern clear, as other Members of the
              Committee have done, at the lack of up-to-date data in the
              Department. Every protection should be given to this endangered
              species, and it should be made unlawful to trap or net hares for
              coursing.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Leslie:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to address Mr Ford’s amendments
              briefly. I share the concerns that he and Dr McCrea have about the
              low number of hares on the evidence of my own eyes. I see far
              fewer over the winter than I would have done 15 years ago.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Very few people would shoot a hare nowadays
              because the numbers are scarce. I know a considerable number of
              landowners who will not permit the shooting of hares. A
              considerable effort is being made within shooting to acknowledge
              the position of hares, and a case could be made for shortening the
              season, which currently runs from 12 August to 31 January. I will
              not propose any amendments during the next Stage on this. However,
              if the season were to be shortened, it should be by the
              December/January part, as this is closer to the pairing off and
              breeding season in March and April.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not agree with Mr Ford’s contention that
              trapping hares for coursing contributes significantly to their
              decline, as almost all go back into the wild. The practices of
              hare coursing here are exemplary; I regret to say that in England
              they do not muzzle dogs, and hares are killed during coursing.
              That is not the case here, although sometimes things go wrong for
              other reasons.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A healthy interest in coursing means a healthy
              interest in hares, and people engaged in the sport have more
              reason than anyone to ensure that the Irish hare increases in
              number. Likely changes in agricultural practices, such as a move
              away from intensive farming, would be the best possible tonic for
              the hare population. I am hopeful that over coming years we will
              be able, largely because of that, to reverse its decline. However,
              I oppose this group of amendments.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr A Doherty:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I enjoy watching wildlife programmes on
              television. It is impossible not to marvel at the amazing variety
              and beauty of mammals, birds, fish and insects in their natural
              habitats. It is also impossible not to be struck by the fact that
              almost every species survives by hunting, killing and eating other
              living creatures — nature red in tooth and claw.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of course, humans are different: we are humane.
              When someone carries out a particularly vicious or nasty act, we
              say that they are beastly, or that they are no better than
              animals. We have got it wrong. Animals must hunt and kill to
              survive; they have no choice.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They do not carry out these acts for fun or
              sport, except now and again. A cat will sometimes toy with, or
              torment, a mouse before killing it. I have seen a school of killer
              whales play, with apparent enjoyment, &quot;pass the parcel&quot;
              with an unfortunate seal — good hunting. The irony is that we
              recoil from such sights, not because those creatures are being
              beastly, but because their behaviour is almost human. The victim
              is no longer food; it is &quot;game&quot;.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It should be obvious by now that I find it
              difficult to feel enthusiasm for legislation that deals with
              hunting and killing, even when the title of the Bill includes the
              word &quot;preservation&quot;. The Bill has little to do with the
              preservation of partridges, snipe or hares so that they can live
              happily in the wild and be eaten by foxes. It deals with those
              creatures as &quot;game&quot;, and they are described as being</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;vitally important components in the rural
              economy&quot;.</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I received a letter from the British
              Association for Shooting and Conservation, which stated that</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Shooting provides a major incentive for
              the management of land — its conservation achievements are
              recognised by the Environment and Heritage Service through a joint
              statement of common interest with BASC&quot;.</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That must be a great comfort to the partridges
              as they are lined up to be shot by our local sporting heroes and
              by visitors from other lands.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am privileged to live in a truly beautiful
              rural area. At times, I have to stop my car a few hundred yards
              from my home to avoid running over a dozen or so newly released
              young pheasants, milling about forlornly in the middle of the
              road. As I shepherd them into a field, they cluster around me as
              if I were their long-lost father. If I were a sportsman, I could
              easily break a record by despatching 10 or 12 pheasants with a
              single shot, although they come so close that I might also damage
              my toes.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The enlightened code of good shooting practice
              seems to dictate that birds must not be hunted until they are
              sufficiently mature. It is reassuring that they are given a good
              sporting chance to fight back with their vicious, animal ferocity:
              hell hath no fury like a mature partridge.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has been said that man is a hunter who will
              hunt in any circumstances. If that is the case, it is preferable
              that he hunt animals rather than other men, and it is preferable
              that his hunting exploits be controlled by legislation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a meat eater, and a conscience-stricken
              member of the Committee for the Environment, I shall not oppose
              the Minister’s Game Preservation (Amendment) Bill and shall give
              due consideration to the other amendments, but I am not a happy
              bunny.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr M Murphy:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. My
              party supports the broad intention of the Bill. However, some
              serious issues with regard to hare coursing have not been
              considered. The Minister advised the Committee for the Environment
              that he would address the issue, and we look forward to a speedy
              response.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are many competing claims and concerns,
              including animal cruelty and the depletion of the hare population.
              The hare population is decreasing, but that is largely due to
              their loss of habitat, which is an important matter in itself.
              Agriculture takes its toll also — for example, combine
              harvesters destroy the habitat of the young hare.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since 1993, dogs involved in hare coursing have
              been muzzled, and veterinarians who are on hand during coursing
              have assured me that all precautions are taken to promote the
              safety of the hare.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issue of the rural economy is also
              important. As coursing is an important part of the greyhound
              industry, it has an economic aspect. Those involved in the
              industry have taken many precautions, such as muzzling dogs, to
              ensure that the sport is more humane. The netting of hares is
              carried out under licence and is supervised by the Department of
              the Environment’s Environment and Heritage Service.</p>
              <i>

              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not support Mr Ford’s amendments, which
              go beyond the intentions of the Bill and have not been subject to
              any public consultation. At present, many land managers who are
              interested in shooting carry out positive action for hare
              conservation. This practice might not continue if the season were
              to last for only six days. It should also be noted that Christmas
              Day is not one of the six days for hare coursing.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Bodies with interests in shooting game are the
              only ones who are carrying out positive action for hare
              conservation, such as habitat management and the control of
              predators that have a profound effect on young hares. The current
              level of hare shooting is sustainable. This amendment would mean
              the unjustifiable loss of opportunity, as it is widely accepted
              that it is changes in agricultural practices that have led
              directly to the decline in the hare population.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Leslie has raised concerns at Committee
              level. However, Mr Ford has signed off the report. He produced his
              amendment at the last minute. I support the Bill but not the
              amendment. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Shannon:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am concerned about the amendments that we are
              debating today. I do not deny that the Member has a right to have
              his say. However, the consultation process on party shooting took
              three years.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As one who has pursued hares as part of the
              country sport of rough shooting, I have some knowledge of the
              subject. I have not shot a hare on our land for at least ten
              years. We do not shoot hares any more, because there are not as
              many of them as there used to be. We used any hares that we took,
              and there was no waste.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These amendments affect the shooting
              fraternity, which is self-regulating. Its regulations have been
              effective. Those who have an interest in the hare will ensure that
              the population increases. There are approximately two or three
              hares on our land on the Ards Peninsula. They are completely
              protected, nobody chases them, and they are left alone. Their
              numbers have remained the same for the last few years, but we hope
              that they will increase.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not know how many hares there are in
              Northern Ireland, and a survey should be carried out across the
              Province to ascertain their numbers. As far as I am aware, the
              only two places in the Province where the hare population is large
              and increasing are Rathlin Island and the Belfast International
              Airport at Aldergrove. People who have flown into Aldergrove may
              have seen the hares on the grass by the runway, and visitors to
              Rathlin may have seen large numbers of hares.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Farming practices have changed; more pesticides
              are used, and the hedges have been removed. These things have
              changed the habitat, and they are contributing factors to the
              decrease in hare populations. That has to be taken into
              consideration when discussing the amendments.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has also been a large increase in the
              number of foxes, which has led to a decrease in the number of
              hares. That is one reason why hares are under threat. If the
              number of hares has decreased, and information indicates that that
              is so, it is time for action to be taken. We are aiming for
              maximum protection of the Irish hare. Landowners, farmers and
              those involved in leisure activities in the countryside are
              clearly protective of the hare. Protection is already in place
              through self-regulation, which shows the remarkable contribution
              from those involved in countryside activities.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of the Environment (Mr Foster):</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank all Members who participated in the
              debate for their undoubted interest and the intensity of their
              arguments. I also thank Mr Ford for his comments. He has certainly
              read up on the subject, although I refute his attempt to castigate
              the Department and his references to inadequacies within it. Those
              are entirely unjustifiable.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank David Ford for his clarification of
              amendment No 1, which, taken with other amendments in that Member’s
              name, would shorten the open season for the hare. The amendments
              would remove section 7(2) of the Game Preservation (Northern
              Ireland) Act 1928. It would reduce, by two months, the open season
              for pursuing or killing hares by hunting with dogs, or by
              coursing. The amendments would also replace the provisions of
              section 7D, subsection 4, of the 1928 Act, which would ban the
              organised coursing of Irish hares which have been trapped or
              netted in Northern Ireland throughout the remaining open season
              from 12 August to 31 January.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The amendment would not prevent imported live
              hares from being used in organised coursing during the open
              season. The remaining amendments are consequential to those two
              proposals. I am aware of the need to keep the hare population in
              Northern Ireland under review. I am also aware of the many
              concerns expressed by Members and by the Committee for the
              Environment. I pay tribute to the Committee for its help and
              co-operation in this matter.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As part of the wider biodiversity process, the
              Department has drawn up a species action plan for the Irish hare.
              The Environment and Heritage Service (EHS) is drawing up an
              implementation plan for a range of biodiversity actions. The EHS
              intends to publish the plan by March 2002. The plan will cover a
              wide variety of measures, some of which will contribute to the
              conservation of habitats used by the Irish hare, such as semi-
              natural grasslands and upland heath. Those will in turn benefit
              the hare and other species that share its habitats.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department will also undertake a repeat
              survey of hares to ascertain what further steps, if any, need to
              be taken to protect the species. However, a survey was also
              carried out between 1997 and 1999 in County Antrim and County
              Down, which was extrapolated to all Northern Ireland, that
              estimated that the hare population was 16,500. That figure is
              similar to the median hare population estimated by the Dingerkus
              study, which was undertaken between 1994 and 1996.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proportion of the hare population that is
              affected by hunting or organised coursing is very small and is of
              negligible importance to both the current size of the population
              here and to the normal fluctuations in populations of small
              mammals such as the hare. Mr Ford has already mentioned ecological
              evidence. Such evidence indicates that the main factors limiting
              the hare population are the availability, non-availability and
              quality of habitat. That suggests that the loss of some hares
              would soon be compensated by the natural expansion of the
              population to reoccupy the vacated habitat. The amendment would
              encourage the undesirable practice of bringing in live hares from
              outside Northern Ireland.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The two birds are completely different.
              Partridges are reared; their numbers can be replaced and augmented
              by rearing. Without rearing, there would be no partridges in
              Northern Ireland and without shooting there would be no rearing of
              partridges. That situation is created by, and for, the shooting
              fraternity. Snipe, about which I shall say more later, are
              completely different. A snipe is a wild bird, and different
              considerations apply to wild birds. Some of those considerations
              are almost contradictory to those that apply to reared birds. I
              expressed reservations about those matters at Second Stage.
              Unfortunately, I missed the key Committee meetings, but, I
              expressed my reservations to the Committee and advised it of my
              intention to table amendments.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As regards partridges, the thrust of the first
              two amendments is that, instead of moving the season from its
              current start of 1 October to 1 September — thereby extending
              the season by one month — <i>[Interruption]</i>.</p>

              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Leslie:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I suggest that, instead of extending the
              partridge season by one month, we should compromise on two weeks,
              starting the season in the middle of September. The reason is that
              it is difficult to be sure of producing fully mature partridges by
              1 September. I cite as evidence for that the fact that few shoots,
              even in the south of England, would start shooting partridges on 1
              September even though they are entitled to do so under the
              Regulations. There is no question but that mature partridges can
              be produced quickly. It would involve a bit of interfering with
              the breeding cycle, but modern genetics has no difficulty with
              that. It would involve stuffing a lot of antibiotics into the
              partridges.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is another reason why it is a bad idea.
              My hope is that we can re-introduce the grey partridge into
              Northern Ireland and introduce the red-legged, or French,
              partridge as a wild bird. However, birds stuffed full of
              antibiotics will not make it in the wild. They will just about
              last out the shooting season, and are unlikely to form wild
              breeding stock. That is another reason why we are not proceeding
              by the optimum means.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At Second Stage, and in subsequent discussions,
              I was concerned to hear that the main argument advanced was that
              there were important commercial considerations and that increasing
              the partridge season by a month would be of great commercial
              value. That is not a good argument for shooting. The preservation
              of wildlife, the enhancement of its habitat and caring for that
              wildlife — matters discussed earlier in the debate about hares
              — are the arguments that I would advance in favour of shooting.
              I am uncomfortable with the commercial argument. As I said, I
              acknowledge that, as agricultural practices change and the areas
              of cultivated land in Northern Ireland are likely to decline,
              people will seek other uses for that land. A reasonable use would
              be more widespread shooting, most of which would be commercial.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The people best placed to judge whether
              partridges are fit to shoot on 1 September would be those who rear
              them or the people in charge of the shoot. I entirely accept that.
              Unfortunately, that is where we bump into a problem with advancing
              the commercial argument for partridge shooting. Someone may have
              booked a group of people from abroad — Italy, for example, which
              is typically a place where they would come from — to come and
              shoot partridges in Northern Ireland during the first week of
              September. If it is discovered in early or mid-August that the
              partridges will not be ready, it is unlikely that people will be
              able to re-arrange their plans. Judgements about the state of the
              partridges will be made after the bookings have been made. If
              groups of foreign visitors come to Northern Ireland to shoot
              partridges during the first two weeks of September, those
              partridges will be shot whether they are ready or not. Therefore,
              despite the best intentions, there is the potential for shooting
              — perhaps inadvertently — to get itself a bad name. The
              commercial arguments are flawed.</p>

              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is safe to start the season on 1 October.
              However, people with long experience of rearing partridges without
              genetic modification have told me that they would be unsure about
              the strength of their birds by that date. If compromise is reached
              and the season begins in mid- September, shooting will take place
              in a proper and sporting manner.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Shooting has another value for partridges.
              Partridges live in family groups called covies. One of the
              benefits of shooting is that it breaks up those covies. Partridges
              then mix and breed with other covies in the wild. One reason why
              native grey partridges died out in Northern Ireland was that they
              remained in their own covies and interbred and, as a result,
              weakened their own stock. That was quite apart from their other
              problems, such as loss of habitat and predators. There are some
              grey partridges left in the Republic of Ireland. With the current
              enthusiasm for the reintroduction of the grey partridge, it may be
              possible to reinstate the breed. The enthusiasm of the shooting
              fraternity would be essential to that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those are the reasons why I believe that the
              House should extend the partridge season by, at most, a fortnight,
              and not by a month as is proposed in the Bill.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The snipe season starts on 1 September and ends
              on 31 January. That was set by a 1954 amendment to the Game
              Preservation Act (Northern Ireland) 1928, consolidating into the
              main legislation the current practice of shooting snipe. The House
              should consider whether it is appropriate to consolidate the
              season on those dates, rather than shorten it by a month. If the
              snipe season were to start on 1 October, it would be set on the
              same basis as the woodcock season. The woodcock is the other
              principal wild bird shot in Northern Ireland. Snipe numbers,
              having fallen to a worryingly low level a few years ago, seem to
              have revived recently. There is no argument that numbers are
              falling; they appear to be rising. However, I repeat my
              dissatisfaction with the commercial argument. Unfortunately, some
              commercial shooting of snipe is taking place. We must be cautious
              about that, because wild birds that are shot commercially cannot
              be replaced by breeding. It is likely that if the season for the
              commercial shooting of partridges is extended, visiting sportsmen
              will be tempted to have another couple of days’ sport by
              increasing the shooting of wild snipe. It would, therefore, be
              prudent to reduce the snipe season by a month and start it from 1
              October.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Currently, self-regulation within shooting
              preserves the snipe population. However, there is always the
              danger that commercial interests can occasionally intervene to
              overcome the best instincts of self-regulation. It would be
              sensible to amend that rule and to remove some of that temptation.
              The biggest self-regulator of the shooting of snipe in September
              is the snipe. There are few of them to be found in Northern
              Ireland at that time, unlike in Scotland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Amendment No 2 would confirm the snipe season
              as it is, and it would vary the proposal on the partridge season
              to the compromise position of having the season start in the
              middle of September. Amendment No 3 would also compromise on the
              partridge season at mid-September, but it would shorten the snipe
              season, starting it on the same day as the woodcock season, which
              is 1 October.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Amendment No 4 is a saver, in that it accepts
              that the partridge season should start on 1 September, but leaves
              out the words &quot;or snipe&quot;. That would put snipe into the
              &quot;any other game bird&quot; category, the result being that
              the snipe season would start on 1 October.</p>

              Shooting and Conservation (BASC), the voice of the shooting
              fraternity, which has a degree of professionalism that is the envy
              of many other bodies representing sporting interests and other
              outdoor recreational pursuits. BASC has approximately 6,000
              subscribing members and is recognised as an authoritative voice by
              statutory and voluntary agencies in Northern Ireland. The
              association, together with participants in the sport of shooting,
              contributes an estimated £15 million to the Northern Ireland
              economy annually.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The principal objective of the Game
              Preservation (Amendment) Bill is to extend the annual shooting
              season for partridge so that it commences on 1 September. That
              change will bring the shooting season for partridges into line
              with Scotland, England and Wales.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A public consultation exercise showed that a
              majority was in favour of commencing the shooting season for
              partridge on 1 September. The Committee for the Environment
              considered the matter in detail and supported the extension to the
              shooting season. I draw Members’ attention to paragraph 10 of
              the explanatory and financial memorandum, which shows the wide
              variety of opinion that supported the Bill.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The concern that partridges are immature by 1
              September is unfounded. It is close to suggesting that there is a
              level of irresponsibility in the management of shoots across the
              Province. BASC is widely accepted as the foremost authority on the
              management of shooting in Northern Ireland. It is the view of the
              organisation — I share the view — that with appropriate
              management partridges can be fully mature by 1 September. Many
              factors have a direct effect on the maturity of game birds that
              are reared and released. Dates of release, stocking densities,
              habitat type, weather conditions, diet and the prevalence of
              disease and its treatment, among other factors, will determine how
              partridges develop.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The shoot manager is the appropriate person to
              decide whether partridge are sufficiently mature to present a
              sporting opportunity. The code of good shooting practice, which is
              supported by all the major shooting organisations, makes specific
              provision for the rearing and release of game birds, including
              partridge. It is widely accepted that there is a high level of
              self-regulation in shooting sports, and there is no evidence of
              bad practice in game management.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The amendments are unnecessary and will defeat
              the principal purpose of the Bill, which is to bring shooting
              practices in Northern Ireland into line with the rest of the

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I oppose the amendments put forward by Mr
              Leslie for several reasons. The consultation process has taken
              upwards of three years to complete. It involved individuals and
              the shooting organisations — the BASC and the Countryside
              Alliance in Northern Ireland. It also involved game conservation
              interests, individual farmers and shoot owners. The consultation
              was wide and far- reaching.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Like many others, I believe that the proposal
              put forward by Mr Leslie to change the date from 1 to 15 September
              does not add up. Indeed, his arguments are suspect. Shooting
              sports are already self-regulating. I said that in the last
              debate. The contribution of countryside sports cannot be ignored.
              The people involved in countryside sports have been actively
              involved in conservation. Conservation is high on their agenda.
              They are the ones who have planted the trees, created the ponds
              and maintained the hedgerows; they have reared and released the
              birds. We must underline the contribution that they have made.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also want to consider tourism. There is
              potential for greater tourism, which can be realised and which
              will be to the benefit of many people. One example — not in my
              constituency but in the constituency of my Colleagues from North
              Antrim — is Rathlin Island. A very successful partridge shoot
              takes place there. The islanders have tried to bring people in
              specifically to take advantage of the opportunities for partridge
              shooting.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Strangford, we have various shoots —
              Portaferry, Greyabbey and Ballywalter to name but three. There are
              many others involving the release of partridge for shooting on the
              Ards Peninsula. Again, those have shown the potential to create
              employment — <i>[Interruption]</i>.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They give an economic boost to people who live
              in the area. There are benefits for the owners of bed and
              breakfast accommodation, hotels and restaurants — indeed, for
              many of the people who live in that area. Our agriculture industry
              and our countryside need that economic benefit, they need it
              quickly. The amendments put forward by Mr Leslie have not
              addressed those issues.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Pheasant shooting takes place on 1 October. In
              most cases, people do not shoot the pheasants until the end of
              October, primarily because the birds are not mature enough.
              However, there are occasions in early October when it would be
              suitable to go out and take advantage of mature pheasant shooting.
              The same thing applies to partridge shooting. Partridge mature
              more quickly than pheasant, mallard or any other bird. They are
              ready for thriving in the countryside, they are healthy enough to
              live in the wilds, and they are ready for pursuit at 1 September.
              It does not matter whether it is at 15 September, as suggested by
              Mr Leslie. It does not make any difference — the birds are
              mature on 1 September. The climate here suits them. Indeed, it
              ensures that those birds are — <i>[Interruption]</i>.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker, I thank you for your comments. We
              must take all the important issues into consideration. The climate
              here suits the early release of partridge. It is down to the
              gamekeepers, to the shoot organisers and to the syndicates —
              they know whether the partridge are sufficiently mature and ready
              to pursue as rough shooting.</p>

              the same legislation here as across the water.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The amendments put forward by Mr Leslie are
              unnecessary and unworkable and do not address the issue. I had the
              pleasure of being in Mr Leslie’s company at a shoot at
              Ballydugan just over a year ago. I suspect that his amendments are

              from the opposite side of the House. However, I found the work of
              the Committee interesting. Mr Leslie said that he had concerns and
              reserved the right to bring them to the attention of the Assembly.
              I remain unconvinced that his amendment would have any appreciable
              benefit in relation to the concerns that he addressed. Advancing
              the season by a fortnight would have a negligible effect.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am more concerned about endangered species
              — and I acknowledge that the Minister responded when these
              matters were raised. If there is the ability under statutory
              regulation to monitor and respond in order to provide the

              debate between those who oppose and those who support. No evidence
              has been produced to support the amendments before us today.
              Therefore I support the view taken by the Environment Committee.</p>

              the Lough Neagh area. If what I saw of the self- regulation of the
              shooting fraternity is anything to go by, then it is no regulation
              whatsoever. There are many instances of young birds, which are
              barely capable of flapping along the surface of Lough Neagh, being
              shot on 1 September. There does not seem to be any regard in the
              shooting fraternity for the age of the bird or its ability to
              escape. Assurances given by the partridge- shooting fraternity
              that they will ensure through self- regulation that young birds
              that cannot escape are not shot are frankly — <i>[Interruption]</i>.</p>

              state, including the Irish Republic. However, I am favour of
              actions being taken to ensure that young birds cannot be shot.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will be totally honest and frank. How anyone
              could find entertainment and amusement from going out on a
              Saturday morning to shoot a wild bird totally escapes me. That is
              my personal opinion. However, I understand that there are others,
              in the House and in the community, who have a totally different
              view, to which they are entitled, as long as they remain within
              the law. I could not shoot a wild bird for sport.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Various points were made earlier about the
              so-called need for this. Mr Shannon, for instance, is a tall,
              well-built gentleman. No one can tell me that he needs to shoot
              for food to maintain his welfare, or that of his three children. I
              suspect that they may well be able to maintain a sensible
              lifestyle without the need for game birds.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is being done entirely for enjoyment. I
              find that very difficult to accept, but there are others who have
              a different opinion. There are enormous pressures, however, on the
              managers of shooting estates to ensure that when parties arrive
              either from Northern Ireland or other parts of the United Kingdom,
              the birds are available to be shot. Those groups may be paying
              several thousand pounds. How can the manager tell them that they
              cannot shoot on a particular day because the birds are not mature
              enough? The economics are such that that is simply not possible.
              We have to establish in statute a date on which we can be fairly
              certain that the birds will be, by the natural way of things,
              ready to be shot and able to escape.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I disagree with Mr Leslie on the point about
              snipe. Snipe are currently under enormous pressure in Northern
              Ireland and throughout western Europe. The evidence from surveys
              in Britain has shown that the snipe population has fallen by 80%
              since 1970. In Northern Ireland, between 1987 and 1995, it has
              fallen by 22%. I took part in the survey in 1987 that established
              the baseline population figure.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The difficulty is that in winter, there is a
              large influx of Continental snipe into Northern Ireland, as well
              as jacksnipe. There are two species — jacksnipe, which is
              protected, and common snipe, which is not. Whilst the Continental
              population has remained fairly stable, the British — and by that
              I mean including Northern Ireland — population has declined
              quite dramatically. The difficulty is that the shooter cannot
              distinguish between British-bred snipe and Continental snipe. They
              are identical, so the Northern Ireland snipe population is shot
              along with the Continental immigrants. We should be restricting
              the shooting season for snipe to as short a period as possible
              because of the impact on the local snipe population. Therefore
              there is some merit in what Mr Leslie says. However, I was not at
              the Committee session to hear the counter- arguments, so I shall
              not be voting for the amendment.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I must nail the false view that shooters are
              the great supporters of conservation and that it is in their
              interest to maintain healthy stocks of wild birds for shooting. If
              only that were true. However, there has been a dramatic decline in
              many prey species in the past 30 years, and it has not been the
              shooting fraternity that has introduced conservation measures to
              protect them. Organisations such as the Royal Society for the
              Protection of Birds (RSPB), the National Trust, the Wildfowl &amp;
              Wetlands Trust (WWT) and similar organisations have acquired
              refuges to protect populations of endangered species.</p>

              Northern Ireland. I accept that other organisations, some of whom
              the Member has mentioned, play a significant part in conservation.

              an expert on shooting and I am not; I derive no enjoyment from
              killing wild animals.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, Mr Morrow’s point is not borne out
              by the facts. Mr Leslie said that the shooting fraternity had
              preserved the partridge and that it was its aim to preserve the
              partridge for shooting. If that were so, why did the partridge
              become extinct in Northern Ireland in 1978? Granted, it was
              reintroduced by shooting interests, but if they had been
              protecting that species in the wild for shooting, why did it
              disappear? Why has the Irish hare population collapsed if those
              individuals protect and conserve its habitat?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Wildlife in Northern Ireland is under enormous
              pressure as a result of the intensification of agriculture. Hedges
              are being uprooted, and wetlands are being drained.</p>

              it comes to debates in the House it moves to another place. If the

              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Wells:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The factors that I have mentioned are leading
              to the dramatic decline of wildlife in Northern Ireland. The
              shooting fraternity, whether it is conserving or otherwise, has
              little or no impact on that situation. Nobody can do anything
              about it. However, I shall bow to greater knowledge on the issue.
              I was not at the Committee session; I did not hear the debate.
              Therefore it would be unfair of me to make a judgement having
              heard only one side of the story. I shall abstain on the motion.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Foster:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I commend Members for showing such interest in
              the debate. There is a feeling of concern, not TLC — tender
              loving care — for the subject. Much sniping has also been going
              on, so much so that I feel like a lion among a den of Daniels.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Amendment No 2, which was tabled by Mr Leslie,
              proposes that the close season for snipe end on 31 August, as
              detailed in clause 1 of the Bill, and that the close season for
              partridge end on 14 September and not 31 August, as detailed in
              the same clause.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Amendment No 3, tabled by Mr Leslie, reiterates
              the proposal contained in the second part of amendment No 2
              pertaining to the close season for partridge, as contained in
              clause 1 of the Bill. Amendment No 4, tabled by Mr Leslie,
              proposes that snipe should be deleted from the provisions of
              clause 1 of the Bill.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.45 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proposals contained in amendments No 2 and
              No 3 pertaining to partridges would reduce the new September
              season to two weeks, considerably eroding the prime purpose of the
              Bill. It would also run counter to the overwhelming support
              received for the measure generally, and particularly from sporting
              interests.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The advice given to the Assembly at the Second
              Stage of the Bill, and consequently to the Committee for the
              Environment, is that normally the birds are fully mature in
              September and — and I must emphasise this — that no
              responsible manager would wish to bring the sport into disrepute
              by releasing birds that were not fully mature. Such action would
              not be considered good sporting practice. I am confident that game
              managers will act responsibly in this.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The British Association for Shooting and
              Conservation and the Countryside Alliance, Northern Ireland,
              supported this view in their evidence to the Committee for the
              Environment. The Committee indicated that in its report on the
              Bill and said that it was content with the proposal as contained
              in clause 1. The proposed extension will bring the legislation
              here into line with that in the rest of the United Kingdom, where
              the maturity of the birds has not been an issue.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to amendment No 4 tabled by Mr
              Leslie, a statutory rule specifying the close season for snipe
              from 1 February to 31 August has been in force since 1 September
              1954, which is, coincidentally, the same as the close season now
              being proposed for partridge in clause 1. As Mr Leslie has already
              said, the purpose of including snipe in clause 1 is to clarify the
              position within the context of the Game Preservation Act (Northern
              Ireland) 1928. Its inclusion in the Bill will mean no change in
              the law for shooting snipe.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is some reference to the numbers of
              snipe, and contrary to what Mr Wells has said, there is no
              evidence to suggest that the numbers of snipe are affected by
              shooting. The 1999-00 survey showed that there are more snipe in
              Northern Ireland since 1996, when the number was exceptionally
              high. I know Mr Leslie and others have considerable experience,
              and I fully recognise their concerns. However, for the reasons I
              have given I have decided not to accept these three amendments.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Leslie:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Members who have contributed. We
              have had a worthwhile discussion on this.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are two matters here. Most Members
              addressed the matter of partridges, which is the main issue in the
              Bill. Less was said on the subject of snipe, which, as I said
              earlier, are different, being wild birds. I can see that snipe
              numbers could be an issue for a long time. My observation is that
              numbers have increased over the past four or five years. I would
              not be able to dispute with Mr Wells how numbers compare with
              numbers in 1970 — I see that Mr Wells has left us. They are
              probably lower now than they were then, but they are higher now
              than they were five years ago. It is difficult to count snipe —
              almost as difficult as it is to shoot them.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Jim Wilson declared his membership of the
              British Association for Shooting and Conservation. I am a member
              of the Countryside Alliance, which does not have any bearing on
              this. I said in the Second Stage debate that I rear, shoot and eat
              partridges.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is wrong to make absolute declarations on
              the maturity of partridges. They are capable of being mature by 1
              September, and if you seek that, you can achieve it, but not
              always. I know people who rear partridges and gamekeepers who keep
              them and arrange for them to be shot. Those people do not believe
              that it is realistic to have them mature by 1 September — some
              think it is quite difficult to do even by 1 October. It depends on
              how natural or unnatural the methods are. It also depends on the
              region. The chances of getting the birds ready early are better in
              the southern area. People are wrong to declare that it is a matter
              of absolutes. If self-regulation of the industry is used, I trust
              that it will work properly.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has been amusing to watch the contortions
              that Mr Wells went through to avoid any idea that there might be a
              split in his party while at the same time supporting and enhancing
              all my arguments. It is a relief to Members on the Ulster Unionist
              Benches that all Members are free to argue their point of view,
              declare their intentions and vote accordingly despite the fact
              that they may not have the same view as their party Colleagues.</p>

              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I propose the amendment as a result of
              representations made to me by the British Association for Shooting
              and Conservation and the Countryside Alliance in Northern Ireland
              to control pest rabbits. The amendment will regularise current
              practice, which has existed for some time. During its
              consideration of the Bill, the Committee for the Environment was
              made aware of the amendment, and it is content with it. I am
              grateful for its support.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The amendment will relax the existing controls
              on where and when rabbits can be shot, allowing for pest rabbits
              to be shot on any land at any time. However, it is subject to the
              requirement that the person must hold a valid gun licence and be
              legally authorised to shoot rabbits on the land in question.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rabbits are defined as ground game for the
              purposes of the Ground Game Acts, the purpose of which is to allow
              farmers to control rabbits that damage their crops, without
              requiring a game licence. It will remain an offence to kill, take
              or destroy any game on a Sunday or at night or to take game or
              rabbits by cruel methods, as stipulated in article 12 of the
              Wildlife (Northern Ireland) Order 1985.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The amendment necessitates several
              consequential amendments to related legislation. It retains the
              Department of Agriculture and Rural Development’s existing
              rights to allow duly authorised departmental officials, including
              vets, to kill, take for veterinary testing or destroy any rabbit,
              under the Diseases of Animals (Northern Ireland) Order 1981, in
              the event of a risk of rabbits transmitting disease to livestock.
              It protects the existing rights of the Forest Service to prevent
              damage as a result of infestation in the vicinity of tree-planted
              land, after prior notice to the owner-occupier.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The provisions of amendment No 11 are
              consequential to amendment No 9 and necessitate the repeal of
              section 1(1)(a),(b), and (c), section 1(3) and section 10 of the
              Ground Game Act 1880. The amendment will also repeal in full the
              provisions of the Ground Game (Amendment) Act 1906, and I have
              detailed the reasons for that. Amendment No 12 takes account of
              the fact that the previous amendments require a change in the long
              title of the Bill.</p>

              to clause 2 and the associated amendments to the repeals schedule

              current practice and with the Wildlife (Northern Ireland) Order
              1985. It will also allow for effective pest control on land types
              that are not covered by current legislation. The proposed
              amendment was put forward as a result of representations made to
              the Committee by the British Association for Shooting and
              Conservation, with support from the Countryside Alliance in
              Northern Ireland. Representatives from those organisations agreed
              the terms of the Minister’s amendments on the protection of game
              and rabbits, the repeals schedule and the long title. The

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Following devolution of power to the Assembly,
              the salary of the Comptroller and Auditor General is determined in
              accordance with the provisions of the Northern Ireland Act 1998.
              These provisions provide that the salary payable to the
              Comptroller and Auditor General (NI) shall be determined by, or in
              pursuance of, a resolution of the Assembly and that the Assembly
              does not have power to reduce the salary payable to the
              Comptroller and Auditor General.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Following correspondence with the Minister of
              Finance and Personnel, the Audit Committee agreed that until an
              agreed procedure was put in place for determining the salary of
              the Comptroller and Auditor General for Northern Ireland with the
              appropriate level of scrutiny, the Audit Committee would carry out
              such functions in relation to its determination that it considered
              necessary. Over the past months, the Committee has examined the
              options for putting in place a formal procedure for doing so and
              will put forward proposals for approval by the Assembly in due
              course.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Under present arrangements, the annual pay
              award for the Comptroller and Auditor General is calculated using
              a formula linked to the judiciary group 5 spot rate and the salary
              payable to permanent secretaries of the Northern Ireland Civil
              Service. That reflects an agreement between the Department of
              Finance and Personnel and the Public Accounts Commission at
              Westminster prior to devolution. That agreement stipulated that
              the salary of the Comptroller and Auditor General for Northern
              Ireland should be progressed along a scale, over a five-year
              period, that would align it with the judiciary group 5 by the time
              he reached 60. However, to prevent the C &amp; AG’s salary from
              overtaking immediately that of a permanent secretary, a mechanism
              was incorporated into the formula to ensure that the Comptroller
              and Auditor General’s salary remained within 5% of that of a
              permanent secretary. The Audit Committee agreed that that
              arrangement should remain in place until proper procedures were in
              place, whereupon the formula could be reviewed.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Public appointments procedures are regulated
              and monitored by the independent Commissioner for Public
              Appointments for Northern Ireland. All public appointments which
              fall under her remit are governed by the overriding principle of
              selection based on merit.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Candidates recommended to Ministers for
              consideration have gone through a rigorous selection process and
              independent scrutiny to ensure compliance with the Commissioner’s
              guidelines. To ensure fairness and equity, all Departments —
              including my own — apply the Commissioner’s procedures to all
              public appointments, including those outside the Commissioner’s
              remit, although adherence to those principles is a matter for the
              appointing Minister.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The central appointments unit in the Office of
              the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister publishes an
              annual report that gives details of all appointments. It also
              analyses them with regard to gender, age, disability, ethnic and
              community background and political activity.</p>
              <b>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the First Minister accept that there is a
              general perception that the public appointments system as
              practiced under direct rule had many imbalances in regard of
              gender, geographical representation and political representation?
              It is vital for the new Administration to be seen to tackle that
              head-on in order to ensure that the highest standard of equality
              proofing is vigorously applied to all public appointments. Can he
              assure us that that will take place? Is it the policy of the
              Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister?</p>
              <b>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I understand the Member’s point and agree
              with a number of his criticisms of appointments made under direct
              rule. We too felt that, on many occasions, direct rule
              appointments were lacking in some respect. However, one should
              take account of the fact that completely new procedures with
              regard to public appointments have been introduced in the last few
              years, in particular the creation of the post of Commissioner for
              Public Appointments and the procedures and guidelines that she has
              established.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those procedures are monitored by the central
              appointments unit, and I recommend that the Member obtains copies
              of its reports. The last report was produced in March 2001, and
              the Member will see the analysis that was conducted.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The situation may not be perfect from his point
              of view, but one should always bear in mind that when appointments
              are made on merit, they can only be made on merit based on those
              who apply. All of us want to see a greater range of applicants,
              because that might cure some lingering problems.</p>

              Appointments to the Parades Commission are made by the Secretary

              of his party who support his arguments within the party have been
              appointed — for example, Mr Kerr and Mr Laird.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">More recently, the Northern Ireland Human

              duties of their ministerial offices. Although they do not attend
              meetings of the Executive in person, DUP Ministers have complied
              with the requirements of the ministerial code in seeking the
              agreement of the Executive on their proposals for the Programme

              correspondence-course relationship in that they afford their views
              on various issues to the Executive in writing and, of course, they
              bring forward departmental proposals to the Executive for
              consideration. The Executive have also been able to address a
              number of issues that affect the areas of these Departments’,
              consistent with their commitments in the Programme for Government.
              That has been particularly so in the area of infrastructure, for

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive, in taking decisions on financial

              concerning the roads programme. We have been able to reflect
              priority and need in those areas. However, by absenting themselves
              from the Executive, Ministers are obviously missing out on the key
              strategic discussions that inform final Executive thinking on some
              of these issues. The Executive are not punishing or penalising any
              Department that is not represented at Executive meetings, but, of
              course, Ministers would be able to make a fuller contribution and
              would be able to make a more rounded presentation of their

              contributed significantly to the resolution, through contact with
              local elected and community representatives, church leaders and

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also congratulate the First Minister and the
              Deputy First Minister on their political initiative; it led to the
              breakdown of the gridlock that characterised the situation at Holy
              Cross Primary School. I pay tribute to the Police Service of
              Northern Ireland for its work to normalise the situation in
              Ardoyne.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What plans do the First Minister and the Deputy
              First Minister have to develop cross-community dialogue and to
              create a cross-community forum? Are there plans to develop
              community policing, which would create stability and security in
              that neighbourhood?</p>
              <b>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with the Member’s comments, and I
              endorse the congratulations that he paid to the police on their
              handling of the issue during the last three months. The police
              have dealt with an extremely difficult situation, and they have
              shown their willingness to respond to the change in climate and to
              the developments of the weekend.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The police intend to adopt a community approach
              in the neighbourhood and have a unit dedicated to that. Precisely
              when and how it is deployed is an operational matter, but I
              believe the police intend to deploy it as soon as possible. I
              welcome the dialogue that took place. A forum is a natural means
              of enabling that to proceed, and the parties to the dialogue will
              control the extent to which it develops. Judging from comments
              made to the Deputy First Minister and me last week, there is a
              willingness to develop this in such a way that the problem does
              not recur.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member is correct. At the first ministerial

              that the environment would be one of the initial areas for
              discussion. Within that there is the matter of radioactive waste
              from Sellafield. The possible impact of climate change and waste
              management is also included.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Initial work on the areas is being taken

              Environment Ministers. I would be very surprised if, at those
              meetings, that issue did not arise and if the point that the
              Member raised did not arise. It is hoped that those matters will

              efficiency, effectiveness and accountability of public
              administration and the delivery of services in Northern Ireland.
              They have set a target of spring 2002 for the launch of a
              comprehensive and strategic review of public administration. Much
              work and discussion has taken place already, and it is hoped that
              conclusions on outstanding issues will be reached in the coming
              weeks.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is essential that there be a significant

              consultation. How best that can be achieved, however, needs to be

              independent advice or consultation will take place in respect of
              the review? The Deputy First Minister also referred to
              consultation with the Assembly and Committees: will there be a
              wider consultation on that, and what methodology will be applied
              in carrying out such consultation?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister:</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Member’s acknowledgement that
              the Executive are undertaking work in this area. It will be a
              major exercise as it represents a unique opportunity to review the
              systems and structures of public administration here. It is
              important that the Executive get it right. They have agreed that
              it is essential that the review has a strong independent element
              that will draw on relevant expertise and experiences learnt in
              other regions and countries. However, the Executive also recognise
              that they cannot shirk their responsibility and that it will also
              be important for the Assembly to be fully engaged in the process.
              Therefore there is a balance to be struck in how the review is
              taken forward.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given the potentially far-reaching implications
              of the review, it is also essential that as many people as
              possible engage in the process and make their views known. It is
              important that those who use and provide public services will have
              an opportunity to voice their opinions and make suggestions.
              Therefore the Executive recognise the need for significant
              consultation, and we are currently considering how best that can
              be achieved.</p>

              aside in the draft Budget for the review if it is to start early
              next year; and why there has not been terms of reference
              established for the review? Those are crucial issues. When the 11
              Departments were created by the pro-agreement parties the promise
              was made that the review would take place, and Northern Ireland is
              now costing £80 million a year more to administer in April 2001
              than it did in April 1998.</p>

              First, as I have previously told the Member in my capacity as
              Minister of Finance and Personnel, the Executive have decided that
              the resources for the review of public administration will be met
              by in-year monitoring. Therefore we have already factored in that
              that is one of the issues that the Executive will be seeking to
              address through in-year monitoring. With regard to the structural
              issues and how the review is to be conducted, the final proposals
              will determine what the exact resource implications will be. Some
              of them are still under consideration in the Executive and will
              then be the subject of further consultation in the Assembly.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An exercise like this must be well thought
              through. Reflex initiatives will not work. We must think through
              all the implications, and the Executive have been discussing
              these. Those of us who attend the Executive have taken part in
              discussions; and those who do not have not taken part in
              discussions. The non-attenders have done nothing to move it
              forward.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We shall meet the commitment of having this
              launched in spring of next year, and we shall then test the
              quality of people’s contribution to and participation in the

              requirements of the ministerial code in seeking the agreement of

              any difficulty, and we were assisted in so doing by the active
              participation of the Department for Regional Development and the
              Department for Social Development; that active participation is

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important that the celebration of one
              culture does not diminish another. We have celebrated the ‘Up in
              Arms’ exhibition, which covered the 1798 rebellion, and we have
              also marked the Act of Union, which, whether one approves of it or
              not, was a defining moment in modern Irish history, the
              consequences of which are still with us.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Next year is the Queen’s golden jubilee, and
              my Department is responsible for co-ordinating Northern Ireland’s
              jubilee programme as part of a Commonwealth- wide event. It will
              be a regional, national and international event. Next year,
              because of a desire expressed by Members, we will mark the annual
              Holocaust Memorial Day on 27 January 2002.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many celebrations and remembrances are
              recognised. It is unfortunate that Mr McElduff sees such events in
              such a narrow way. Marking, or celebrating, one culture does not
              diminish another. The golden jubilee celebration is a legitimate
              expression of the wishes of the people in Northern Ireland.</p>

              if they were unable to celebrate their events. However, we cannot
              celebrate everything; we must prioritise. It is also important
              that events are not dealt with divisively. It is unfortunate,
              returning to the main question, that Mr McElduff chooses to see
              the event in divisive terms, rather than as part of a shared
              cultural heritage. It is something that we all share. We can all

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The celebration next year of the Queen’s

              modern Irish history, and we are still living with the
              consequences of it. Such an event merits being marked.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must be careful about marking the birthdays
              of individuals, because we must then assess whom we consider to be
              of particular importance. The Member, for example, mentioned
              Carson and others. Many of those things spring readily to mind,
              and their importance is self-evident. I do not see this as being
              an annual event or something that requires the creation of
              criteria. Certain things are self-evident, and the Act of Union is
              one of them. The golden jubilee is being celebrated throughout the
              kingdom, and, as the Member is aware, Northern Ireland is part of
              the kingdom. The occasion is being celebrated throughout the

              God knows where&quot; — who was executed in Downpatrick Gaol,
              which is now the Down County Museum. Is the Minister aware that
              the Hearts of Down — a group of museum curators and historians
              — is organising a series of events to commemorate that, and will

              postponed. Another meeting is planned to take place in December
              2001. I understand that the recognition of darts will be on the
              agenda. Darts has not, so far, been recognised UK-wide as a sport
              on the grounds that insufficient physical activity is involved.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Minister agree that the issue is —
              to use a sporting analogy — constantly kicked into touch? I
              first asked the question about the recognition of darts as a sport
              in December 2000. I was advised that the matter would be
              considered in spring 2001. That did not happen. I posed the
              question again in May 2001, only to be told that it would be
              considered in June 2001. It is now almost the end of November
              2001, and I am told to expect a reply sometime next month.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The previous question referred to
              anniversaries, centenaries and bicentenaries. I trust that I shall
              not be posing my question next year on its second anniversary.
              Many people feel discriminated against because they do not have
              access to suitable funding for a worthwhile sport.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGimpsey:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Close is right to say that I gave him
              timetables. Responsibility for activities that are considered
              sports in Northern Ireland lies with the Sports Council for
              Northern Ireland. Recognition of sports lies with home countries’
              sports councils, which have a recognition panel that meets once a
              year. It was anticipated that the panel would meet earlier in the
              year, but it has not met to date. I am told that it will meet in
              December, as I said. It is not in my power to determine when the
              recognition panel meets, but I anticipate that, because the rules
              dictate that the panel must meet once a year, it will do so before
              the end of the year.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If darts is recognised as a sport — this is
              the reason behind the question and the lobbying — it can apply
              for National Lottery sports funding. However, simply being
              recognised as a sport does not guarantee funding. It simply allows
              access to that fund. I refer the House to the definition of sports
              used by the Sports Council and throughout the home countries:</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;all forms of physical activity, whether
              through casual or organised participation, aimed at expressing or

              levels.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Darts has not, so far, been recognised as a
              sport on the grounds that insufficient physical effort is
              involved. It may be that the recognition panel has decided to
              change its opinion, but, as things stand, the likelihood of
              success should not be rated too highly.</p>

              reasons the planetarium is only open on a limited basis and that
              the star theatre remains closed. However, limited opening has
              proved to be a great success, as has the outreach service to
              schools and other groups.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The four options suggested by the review were
              to maintain the status quo on the basis of limited opening;
              demolition and rebuilding; an expanded outreach service; and
              closure. It will surprise no one that my preference at this stage
              would be for the construction of a new planetarium. However,
              funding issues must be taken into account before a final decision
              is reached.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am mindful that the planetarium has an
              important educational role and that it is not just a matter of
              pounds and pence. Its historical site beside the observatory is
              another important asset in the cultural estate. I assure the

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important to recognise that in order to

              the physical barriers; there are social and community barriers as
              well. We must consider the broad sweep of accessibility.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In November 2000, the Department of Culture,
              Arts and Leisure initiated the ADAPT Northern Ireland (Access for
              Disabled People to Arts Premises Today) pilot programme to carry
              out an audit of 40 venues. The audit was completed, and £100,000
              has been allocated to allow the pilot programme to continue. In
              addition, I announced funding of £100,000 for the Arts Council,
              specifically for widening access. That money allowed for wider
              access for new generation audiences, early-years provision and the
              development of partnership with district councils. Therefore, the
              Department is moving forward on more than one initiative in order
              to achieve progress in its policy of widening access.</p>

              projects are funded. The Arts Council — through directly voted
              funds and lottery funds — makes an important contribution, not
              only to the big venues such as the Grand Opera House and the new
              Millennium Theatre in Derry but also to smaller venues up and down

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important to stress that we are
              considering the Lagan navigation in two parts. I was referring to
              the lower Lagan navigation, not least because most of the land
              involved is owned by my Department and other public bodies. Much
              of the upper Lagan navigation — the Lough Neagh end — has been
              sold off since its abandonment in the 1950s. Therefore, it is
              easier and more cost-effective to begin with the section of the
              canal that is still in public ownership.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It would be difficult to argue the case for
              public funding for the entire investment. We must consider various
              ways of obtaining the funding and different approaches to the
              project. For example, there are 13 locks on the lower Lagan
              navigation canal alone. As a member of Lisburn Borough Council, Mr
              Poots will know how much it costs to refurbish one lock, let alone
              the whole canal. That will involve considerable investment. I will
              not give a figure for it because the figure that I was given
              originally has long since been superseded.</p>

              anticipating a building budget deficit of between £100,000 and
              £300,000. However, I understand that it is hopeful that the

              deficit. There is also the possibility of an operating budget
              deficit in this financial year. The Derry Theatre Trust is working

              farmers, including the service to farmers through colleges, the
              advisory services and the veterinary services. While this is not
              money that goes directly into farmers’ pockets, without those
              services those farming communities would be at a great

              to bring about the successful prosecution of fraudsters? Will the
              Minister make a statement to the House on that travesty at the

              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Rodgers:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member is somewhat confused. The fraud that
              he refers to comes to a total of £17,000. There is an annual
              fraud bill of £58 million in another Department that is the
              responsibility of a Minister with whom the Member is very
              familiar. I am surprised that he is not making a bigger issue of
              that. There is quite a difference between £17,000 and £58
              million.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After a review of fraud, the Department of
              Agriculture and Rural Development brought forward a strategy that
              was put before the Committee last Friday. It deals with areas
              where the Department must tighten up. With regard to the specific
              issue that the Member refers to — the south Armagh cull — the
              Department has always prosecuted farmers who are found to be in
              default or are attempting to defraud the system. Last year there
              were five successful prosecutions. There was also a successful
              prosecution in August 2001. However, the legislation on which that
              prosecution was based was challenged, and an appeal was launched.
              The Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), who was in possession
              of the facts about the south Armagh cull that I had made available
              to the House and to the public in July 2001, had arranged dates
              for seven cases to be heard. The view was that the prosecutions
              could go ahead.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the day of the appeal to the August case,
              however, the DPP decided that it should not go ahead because there
              was a point of law on which the legislation was weak. He
              subsequently decided not to go ahead with the cases in south
              Armagh. Therefore, until recently the Department had been able to
              prosecute on the basis of that law. It has moved to address the
              situation. The law is being changed to ensure that that does not
              happen again.</p>

              concerns and priorities for the development of the common
              agricultural policy (CAP), and the related issues of EU
              enlargement and World Trade Organisation negotiations. We have
              agreed to continue to review developments on those matters. I have
              regular discussions with my ministerial counterparts in Great
              Britain on a broad range of agriculture issues, including the
              future of the CAP. They are aware of my views.</p>

              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Rodgers:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Margaret Beckett’s position on CAP reform
              reflects the stance that was adopted by successive UK Agriculture
              Ministers and Governments. I recognise the pressures on CAP and
              appreciate that further reform is inevitable, but I have grave
              concerns about the agriculture industry’s ability to embrace
              radical change at present.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is crucial that we avoid adding to the
              difficulties and the genuine fears that exist in rural
              communities. Any reform of the CAP should take place at a
              sustainable pace, and we must be prepared to help the industry
              through the significant difficulties that change will bring. There
              will be change as a result of the World Trade Organisation
              negotiations and the need to reform the CAP, but the industry and
              our farming community must be supported so that they can remain
              viable.</p>

              Speaker, you will be aware of the difficulties that will result
              from the CAP reforms and the enlargement of the European Union.
              Everyone in the House is aware that agriculture has suffered 10
              years of reversal and that it has since been further blighted with
              the foot-and- mouth disease.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Minister agree that the new dimension
              adds urgency to the arguments in favour of an early retirement
              scheme and a loan scheme for farmers? Those would create a
              legislative framework around which the agriculture industry could
              be restructured to meet the new threats that will result from the
              accession of eastern European states to the European Union.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Rodgers:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I accept the Member’s point about the early
              retirement scheme; I know that there is a demand for it in many
              areas. I received the vision report on the subject some time ago,
              and I am consulting all interested parties on that. I am examining
              the possibility of an early retirement scheme, but I have not yet
              reached a conclusion. A desk study was carried out, but a
              definitive conclusion was not possible because there was an
              absence of proper research. I have therefore initiated research to
              be carried out by University College Dublin and Queen’s
              University into the impact of early retirement schemes in other
              parts of the EU. The vision group favours the introduction of a
              new entrants scheme, but it is not in favour of an early
              retirement scheme.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am aware of the need for restructuring, but I
              cannot come to a conclusion on the matter until I have seen the
              results of the research into its impact on the industry and its
              cost-effectiveness. An early retirement scheme might eat up the
              entire budget, but it would accommodate just a small number of
              farmers, leaving the vast majority without resources. I am
              open-minded, and I am examining every angle.</p>

              opinion is. It is a case of having to face the reality that change

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is most important for us to face those

              am concerned about a headlong rush or a quick move to remove
              subsidies. Change will impact on the level of subsidies, but I
              want it to be at a pace that will allow us to ensure that our

              January 2002. Beef produced in Northern Ireland will be labelled
              as UK beef, but there is no reason why, for marketing or other
              reasons, processors or those with commercial concerns cannot put a
              label of their own choosing on it. However, it will have to bear
              the UK stamp because that is the member state from which the beef

              foot-and-mouth disease spread through that category of farm
              animals during the recent crisis? Will the Minister indicate if
              the problem of scrapie in sheep is being tackled, particularly on
              a North/South, all-Ireland basis?</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Scrapie has been present for over 200 years,
              and it has been a notifiable disease in Northern Ireland since
              1992. The control measures taken by my Department include a legal
              obligation on flock owners to notify the Department of suspected
              cases of scrapie. Those animals are slaughtered, and the farmers
              are compensated for their loss. The carcasses are tested by the
              veterinary science division and then destroyed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Feeding ruminants meat-and-bone meal has been
              banned since 1989, and controls in this area were significantly
              strengthened in 1996. Specified risk material controls were
              introduced in 1990 for cattle, and in 1996 for sheep. In 1993 the
              Department initiated a national scrapie monitoring scheme
              involving a sampling target of 330 sheep per annum at abattoirs.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A programme of active surveillance in
              accordance with EC Regulation 999/2001 involving sample testing of
              sheep over 18 months old will start in January 2002. The
              authorities in the Republic take similar control measures. The
              nature of the disease and the sheep population in Ireland means
              that it makes sense to adopt a unified approach. Under the
              auspices of the North/South Ministerial Council, Joe Walsh and I
              have committed ourselves, in principle, to an all-Ireland approach
              to achieve the eradication of scrapie on an island-of-Ireland
              basis. We are consulting on proposals for a voluntary scheme
              involving genotyping, which is a method of breeding resistance to
              scrapie into the sheep population, as well as other more focused
              eradication measures. The proposals for a Northern Ireland scrapie
              plan are designed to take advantage of the low incidence of
              scrapie here, to reduce and, over time, to eliminate scrapie from
              the Northern Ireland flock.</p>

              Invest Northern Ireland (INI) has a role in the promotion of
              energy plants using biofuels. My Department promotes the use of
              biofuels and biolubricants where it makes business sense to do so.
              For example, Forest Service actively encourages the use of
              biodegradable oils in its vehicles and machines in support of
              certification of its forests under the United Kingdom woodland
              assurance standard. Other forestry machinery will be adjusted to
              use biodegradable products where practicable and where operations
              can realistically bear the additional costs. Similarly, forestry
              contractors will be encouraged to follow the example set by Forest
              Service.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Glenarm salmon frequently turns up on the menu
              here, and I was in a restaurant on Saturday night where it was
              also on the menu. I wondered how it had suddenly become so
              popular.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members have raised concerns about the genetic
              integrity of the wild fish, and the Department of Agriculture and
              Rural Development will keep a close eye on that area. However, the
              Department has already conducted some work in that area. It
              monitored the genetic composition of the salmon stock in the
              river, following an escape in 1990. That indicated that some
              change in the genetic composition of the wild population had taken
              place, and that was probably attributable to interbreeding between
              wild fish and escaped farmed fish in the lower part of the river.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no evidence that such a change is
              detrimental to the wild population, but precautionary scientific
              advice is to remove as many of the escaped farmed fish from the
              river as possible. Accordingly, no fish of farm origin would be
              selected as brood stock as part of any fishery enhancement
              activity, and the Department’s technical staff will repeat the
              electro-fishing operation to remove any remaining escapees before
              the spawning period.</p>

              established by resolution on 10 September 2001, and agrees that it

              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Following the resolution of the Assembly on 10
              September, the Ad Hoc Committee established to consider the
              proposal for a draft Criminal Injuries Compensation (Northern
              Ireland) Order 2001 and its associated scheme met on 17 September,
              and I was elected as Chairperson. As Chairperson, it is my
              responsibility to present a report to the Assembly for its
              endorsement.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall give a brief overview of the background
              of the draft proposals and the work that the Committee undertook.
              In October 1997, the then Secretary of State for Northern Ireland,
              the Rt Hon Dr Marjorie Mowlam MP, established the Northern Ireland’s
              Victims Commission to consider possible ways to recognise the pain
              and suffering felt by victims of violence associated with the
              troubles. That commission, chaired by Sir Kenneth Bloomfield,
              reported in April 1998, and one of its recommendations was for the
              Government to establish an objective, independent and wide-ranging
              review of the fitness for purpose of the compensation system as it
              operated in Northern Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On 12 August 1998, the then Minister for
              Victims, Adam Ingram, announced the Government’s intention to
              establish such a review as part of the Victims Liaison Unit’s
              package of measures. That review was established, and, in July
              1999, a report was issued for consultation, prior to the final
              recommendations being submitted to the Government.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will list some of its recommendations for a
              fairer, more equitable, open and transparent system. Compensation
              should continue to be decided by the Compensation Agency, with a
              right of appeal to the courts; there should be a simpler method of
              deciding how much compensation is paid for less serious injuries;
              victims who suffer more serious injuries should continue to have
              their claims assessed as at present; where a person has died as a
              result of violent crime, an enhanced bereavement support payment
              should be payable up to a maximum for any one family of £50,000;
              compensation for psychiatric illness should be paid in a wider
              range of cases; there should be more flexibility in the time limit
              for making an application; and cases should be capable of being
              reopened in particular circumstances.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Government’s response to those proposals
              was contained in the draft Criminal Injuries Compensation
              (Northern Ireland) Order 2001 and the draft Northern Ireland
              Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme 2002. The Government did not
              accept all the review’s recommendations.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Over the past few weeks, the Ad Hoc Committee
              has heard evidence from various interested bodies — the
              Compensation Agency, the Law Society of Northern Ireland, the
              Northern Ireland Office and Victim Support Northern Ireland.
              During those meetings, many issues were raised, and the Committee
              considered each in detail.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proposals are being taken forward by the
              Northern Ireland Office, and the Committee welcomed the
              opportunity to comment on them in their draft form. The key
              features of the proposed new arrangements are the introduction of
              a tariff of injuries, setting out the value of specific injuries;
              the hearing of appeals by an independent appeals panel; and the
              removal of paid legal assistance from the scheme, to be replaced
              by support and help from Victim Support Northern Ireland. There
              should also be wider eligibility criteria and other changes to
              eradicate anomalies; the removal of specific terrorist exclusion
              provisions; and provisions for past victims of child sex abuse,
              who cannot claim because of the current statutory time limits, to
              make a fresh claim.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee had reservations about the
              proposed legislation. The assumption that a tariff system is in
              the best interests of victims of crime is erroneous. All the
              evidence suggests that it is a cost-saving exercise that will
              reduce the compensation paid to victims of crime, while removing
              paid legal assistance. The Committee felt that the removal of the
              right of appeal to the courts as part of the due process of law is
              fundamentally flawed and may be subject to challenge under the
              Human Rights Act 1998.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee recognised the role played by
              Victim Support Northern Ireland over many years in supporting and
              counselling victims. However, the proposal to use Victim Support
              Northern Ireland in a quasi-legal support role is inappropriate,
              given the reservations outlined in its submission.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee noted the core recommendations
              set out in the Law Society of Northern Ireland’s supplementary
              memorandum of evidence. It called for the establishment of a
              working party with a general remit to examine the compensation
              process. The key objective would be to bring about systematic
              improvement by addressing the problems of delay and ensuring
              transparency, communication and closer liaison among agencies in
              the system. The Committee encouraged the Northern Ireland Office
              to engage with the Law Society and give due consideration to its
              proposals.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In light of the Committee’s reservations
              about the proposed new arrangements, the Committee recommended
              that the proposed legislation should not be introduced to
              Parliament in its current form. Despite a tight timescale, the
              Committee considered all the proposals, and, although some of them
              would be welcome, the Assembly should send a strong message to the
              Northern Ireland Office that the proposals should not be
              implemented as they stand in the draft Order and scheme. I
              recommend that all Members lend their support to our report and
              its recommendations.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr K Robinson:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Committee Clerk and his staff and
              those who gave evidence to the Committee or made written
              submissions that helped us in our consideration of the proposals.
              We were charged by the Assembly to produce a report by 27
              November, and we have fulfilled that duty, albeit with just a day
              to spare. We held six Committee meetings, took oral evidence from
              four bodies and received submissions from another six. The record
              of that evidence is in annexes three and four of the report.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Ad Hoc Committee took its scrutiny role
              seriously. Given the central importance of victims in our society,
              we were guided by a shared desire to recognise their trauma and
              continuing suffering. As far as possible, we also wished to ensure
              that society understood why victims deserved to have their
              suffering considered sensitively and practically. In that context,
              I welcome the proposal referred to in paragraph 66 on page 17 of
              the report, which seeks to introduce a &quot;bereavement support
              payment&quot;. Victim Support Northern Ireland and many other
              bodies also welcome that proposal, which not only acknowledges the
              grief and sorrow caused by the death of the victim but ensures
              that there will be no further misinterpretation of the purpose of
              the payment. The proposed extension of the cohabitation
              definition, as noted in paragraph 67 on page 17 of the report,
              together with the two-year residential time frame, are also viewed
              as positive indications of a desire to reduce the trauma for
              victims and their families.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For those claiming compensation for
              psychological injuries, the proposal is to widen the eligibility
              criteria, and that is also viewed as a positive step towards
              recognising the suffering of many in our society. I welcome the
              removal of the stipulation requiring a person &quot;to be present
              at the scene of the crime&quot;. Anyone who reads the case
              submitted by Victim Support Northern Ireland on page 108,
              paragraph 3i, will concur. That case concerns a lady who was
              confronted by a harrowing scene at the end of her lane, following
              a heinous crime perpetrated by terrorists. As any good Samaritan
              would, she responded to the need of that fellow human being, who
              died in her arms. She was subsequently denied compensation for the
              trauma that she had experienced, as she was deemed not to have
              been present at the scene of the horrific crime.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the inclusion of the proposal to
              define a disabling mental illness, rather than the previous
              reference to serious and disabling mental disorder and to have
              that confirmed by psychiatric diagnosis. That is a step forward in
              recognising the different forms of trauma experienced by victims.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So far, I have welcomed the proposals in the
              draft Order, but I must now express some serious concerns. The
              proposals purport to address the needs of the victim regarding
              time scales, transparency and reduction of trauma. One could be
              forgiven, however, for drawing the conclusion that the tariff
              system is a device for reducing compensatory payments. The wisdom
              of removing the assessment of compensation from the judiciary and
              placing it in the hands of the executive arm of Government is to
              be questioned. On page 19 paragraph 3c of the report it states
              that the Law Society of Northern Ireland proposes the
              establishment of a working party that would include
              representatives of the professions, agencies and victims in order
              to prevent such a contingency. I welcome that proposal. The
              working party would consider the present system, identify measures
              to reduce delays, improve inter-agency communication and seek to
              increase transparency.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee considered that the proposals in
              the draft Order exacerbated the claimant’s distress by
              constraining his or her ability to have needs individually
              assessed, even more than the present arrangements. The example
              submitted by the Association of Personal Injury Lawyers — the
              details are on page 69 — concerning the individual impact that
              the loss of an eye would have on a pilot as opposed to an elderly
              person highlights the need for each case to be assessed
              individually.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.15 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am in serious conflict with the proposal to
              withdraw paid legal assistance from claimants. We recommend that,
              in the interests of fairness, paid legal assistance should
              continue. The tariff system will seriously erode the ability of a
              claimant to receive adequate or equitable settlement. The
              stipulations concerning multiple injuries, as commented upon in
              paragraphs 78 and 79 on page 19 of the report, illustrate the
              point that the tariff system’s inflexibility will cause
              claimants to lose out. We also noted that the scale of tariffs is
              significantly lower than that currently available under the 1996
              Northern Ireland &quot;Green Book&quot; formula.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Victims will be penalised by any proposals that
              are designed to deduct payments from private healthcare insurance
              towards medical expenses or healthcare arrangements. That
              situation would be further exacerbated by the proposed removal of
              compensation for the loss of earnings for the first 28 weeks
              following an injury and the removal of compensation for special
              expenses, such as the adaptation of accommodation, unless earnings
              capacity had been lost. Both proposals appear punitive and are not
              in keeping with the Northern Ireland Victims Commission’s remit
              to recognise the pain and suffering felt by victims of violence.
              After all, that was what led to the 1998 review of criminal
              injuries compensation, 64 recommendations of which laid the basis
              for many of the current proposals.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I subscribe fully to recommendations 6, 7, 8
              and 9 and to the conclusion in recommendation 10 that the proposed
              legislation should not be introduced to Parliament in its present
              form.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, the role envisaged for Victim Support
              Northern Ireland is grossly unfair to that highly respected body.
              How can it be expected to assemble on a Province- wide basis the
              number of highly skilled personnel needed to deal with thousands
              of extremely complicated cases? That defies all logic, as the
              Committee of the Centre highlighted in its submission, reproduced
              on page 79 of the report.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The withdrawal of legal aid will save an
              estimated £7 million, yet additional funding of only £400,000
              will be provided for Victim Support. Surely, there is cause for
              concern that, if the level of support to claimants that is
              envisaged in paragraph 50 on page 14 is introduced, applicants
              will not receive the representation that is currently provided by
              geographically well dispersed, long-standing legal firms with
              expertise in the field. That fact cannot be ignored.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Victim Support should be given an enhanced,
              proactive role that reflects its specific expertise in providing
              support and counselling for the victims of crime. I support the
              recommendation made by the Chairperson of the Ad Hoc Committee
              that the proposed legislation should not be introduced to
              Parliament in its present form.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr A Maginness:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have all become sensitised to the need to
              recognise the position of victims. One of the outstanding success
              stories is that, since the agreement, we have built a consensus
              that recognises the special needs and place of victims. I wish
              that that recognition were reflected in the draft legislation. It
              seems that the Government have not learnt the lesson that victims
              in Northern Ireland deserve special attention, sensitivity and
              care. Not only are the proposals presented to the Assembly
              inadequate, they are antipathetic to the interests of victims. The
              Ad Hoc Committee’s report reflects the concern that we, as
              legislators, have for victims of violent crime in Northern
              Ireland. This is probably the worst piece of draft legislation
              that the British Government have presented to the Assembly for
              consideration.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Ad Hoc Committee’s robust critique of the
              Government’s proposals has done a great service to the cause of
              victims. It has highlighted the gross deficiencies in the proposed
              legislation. The draft Order purports to reflect the Bloomfield
              report; it does not do that. The proposed legislation departs
              materially from the Bloomfield report, which did not recommend
              that all injuries should be governed by a tariff scheme. The
              Bloomfield report proposed that minor injuries should be
              considered by a tariff scheme.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Along with other members of the Committee, I
              have misgivings about adjudging even minor injuries on a tariff
              basis. However, serious injuries should surely not be adjudged on
              a tariff basis. Ken Bloomfield made it clear that he excluded
              serious injuries from any tariff scheme. He also said that he
              would retain the right of appeal to the county court for victims
              of violent crime. That is an important provision, because the
              right of appeal to the courts is a safeguard for everyone,
              particularly for the victims of violent crime.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If there is no right of appeal to a court, a
              victim’s position with the statutory agency —the Compensation
              Agency — is seriously weakened. As Ken Robinson suggested, that
              hands over adjudication of compensation for victims to the
              executive. In the Western World at least, the separation of powers
              is regarded as a fundamental part of constitutional politics. In
              other words, the executive is separate from the judiciary. It is
              important that that separation is maintained, because it is a
              safeguard for everyone. The proposed legislation fuses the
              executive and the judiciary. There is no effective appeal to a
              judicial body. That is fundamentally wrong.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Ad Hoc Committee considered the tariff
              scheme carefully and unanimously opposed it. The Committee
              believes that a tariff system is inadequate for safeguarding the
              interests of victims, as there is no individual assessment of the
              pain and suffering that someone has endured. As Bloomfield said:</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;there is no objectively ‘right’ sum
              of money that can compensate an individual for the pain and
              suffering he or she has endured as a result of an injury&quot;.</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Furthermore, the Judicial Studies Board, in its
              ‘Guidelines for the Assessment of Damages in Personal Injuries’,
              3rd edition, 1996, states:</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;there is no right or exact figure for all
              cases involving the same injury, because no two victims suffer in
              exactly the same way&quot;.</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proposed tariff system implies that
              everyone who breaks a leg endures the same pain and suffering.
              That is wrong, and that proposition should not be adopted into our
              law. A tariff system cannot properly compensate the victim of
              violent crime; it cannot compensate a person at all. The absence
              of individual consideration of pain and suffering goes to the
              heart of the proposals. We should not embrace the tariff system.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The tariff system is an invention of the civil
              servant mind. It attempts to bar code pain and suffering, and that
              cannot be done. Suffering is an individual experience, and it
              requires individual assessment. If one were to canvass opinion
              among victims who have suffered grievously, one would hear exactly
              that. Many victims have had misgivings about our judicial system
              and about their treatment by lawyers and others. Nonetheless,
              given the choice, they would opt for the court rather than for an
              anonymous system that would not, in my view and in the view of the
              Committee, compensate the individual.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proposals remove the right of appeal to the
              courts. Instead, a board will consider the cases of victims who
              have been dealt with by the Compensation Agency. The board will
              act as a court of appeal. We know from experience what such boards
              are like. We know the difficulties encountered by people who
              appeal decisions on disability living allowance. We know that
              honest citizens who appeal to such boards go through severe
              trauma. We must not be fooled: the boards are not judicial bodies,
              and they will not bring the same judgement and discretion to the
              cases of victims as the courts do.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The amounts given in the proposed scheme do not
              reflect the current level of awards in Northern Ireland; they are
              grossly undervalued. They are supposed to reflect pain and
              suffering, but they do not. The evidence from the Law Society
              shows that victims’ pain and suffering are being greatly
              undervalued.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The green book — the guide to personal
              injuries that lawyers and judges use — shows that quite plainly.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.30 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, it gets worse. In cases of multiple
              major injuries, it is proposed that people should be compensated
              in full only for their worst injury. The compensation for the
              second most serious injury, even if it should be £50,000, can be
              reduced to 30% of that amount. The compensation for the third most
              serious injury is reduced to 15% of the possible amount payable.
              Therefore, a person is awarded 145% out of a possible 300%.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People’s compensation is being deliberately
              undervalued according to this scheme, and the Government make no
              bones about it. That is the formula. Worse still, no compensation
              whatsoever is payable for the fourth and subsequent injuries. How
              can that be regarded as equitable or just? I ask anyone who is
              reasonable and objective to say that the scheme is fair and
              equitable. It clearly is not.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The scheme also compensates for minor injuries.
              In order to qualify for minor injury compensation, the claimant
              must jump over three hurdles. He or she must have three separate
              injuries; a black eye is not enough, a claimant must have other
              injuries as well. There must also be significant residual effects
              that last for more than six weeks, and the injured party must have
              made two visits to a medical person. There are three different
              hurdles to jump over, and that is unjust. The test is wrong and
              unfair.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On examining the system in more detail, it
              becomes obvious that people will not be compensated for pecuniary
              losses such as loss of earnings. Claimants must be out of work for
              28 weeks before they can receive one penny of compensation for
              loss of earnings. That is clearly unjust — a child could tell
              you that that is unjust.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How does that square up with the Government’s
              view that it is a new and wonderful system that will help victims?
              How could it possibly help a victim to lose half a year’s
              earnings through no fault of their own and not receive
              compensation? How could that possibly be just, right or fair? And
              yet, the Government have the cheek to present these proposals to
              us and dress them up by saying that they are trying to produce a
              new system that is fair to victims and will help them. How can
              that possibly be, in present circumstances?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although we received assurance to the contrary,
              this fact must be highlighted: the proposals suggest that private
              insurance and private pension awards, as a result of injuries,
              should be deducted from any pecuniary loss. People would not —
              despite the fact that they paid into their pension fund or
              insurance fund — be able to enjoy that money. Instead, it would
              be deducted from any pecuniary loss. Surely that is wrong and
              unfair. We received a letter from the NIO in which it explains
              somehow that that does not form the substance of its proposal. If
              that is the case, let us hold the NIO to that commitment. It is
              important to highlight that today, in case the Government should
              back-pedal.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Government have turned off the tap of legal
              assistance to victims of violent crime by refusing to pay
              reasonable legal or medical costs. How can that be just? How does
              that advance the interests or status of victims? Victims who need
              legal assistance in this complex area of law will not receive it.
              Surely that is wrong, given that at present we are trying to help
              victims of violent crime.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Government say plainly that they aim to
              save £7 million. Is that not a cruel assertion? That £7 million
              is important to victims of crime who require legal advice. It is
              wrong that the Government should refuse to continue to provide
              legal assistance. As Ken Robinson said, the Government are putting
              back only £400,000 to Victim Support Northern Ireland. Its staff
              have done a tremendous job in giving practical care and
              counselling to the victims of crime here. That is their role;
              their job is not to act as surrogate lawyers. Victims seeking
              compensation through this complicated process will be deprived of
              practical legal assistance. If people seek legal advice, they will
              have to pay for it themselves. That is wrong.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Government then go even further to
              disadvantage victims by proposing that the limitation period for
              claims be reduced from three years to two. How can they justify
              that? They have included what they would call a &quot;safety
              net&quot; whereby, in the interests of justice, that limitation
              period can be altered. However, those boards will act as
              tribunals, and it will be difficult to argue for an extension of
              the time period. It is already difficult to gain an extension in
              the ordinary courts, which apply a three-year time limit, but it
              will be even more difficult to argue to a tribunal for an
              extension to the two-year limitation period.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several parts of the proposed legislation would
              further disadvantage victims. However, there are some good
              aspects. For example, applicants for criminal injury compensation
              who have a criminal conviction will be given more flexibility.
              Madam Deputy Speaker, do you wish me to bring my remarks to a
              close?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Madam Deputy Speaker:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A number of Members still wish to speak, so I
              invite you to draw your remarks to a conclusion.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr A Maginness:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will finish by saying that those who are
              excluded from compensation because of previous convictions,
              particularly for scheduled offences, will be treated with greater
              discretion. One only has to look at the Creighton case, which has
              been foremost in our minds in considering this. If somebody has
              fully rehabilitated himself, it is surely fair and just that he be
              compensated.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My final point on this is that the Government
              have said that they sought certainty and simplicity for victims
              and sought to be transparent in dealing with them. Quite clearly,
              these proposals, in my view and in the view of the Committee, will
              provide greater uncertainty and frustration for victims of violent
              crime. This system will be much more complicated than the present
              one, and the House should send a clear message to the Government
              that it unanimously adopts this report to stop this bad
              legislation in its tracks.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr O’Hagan:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I
              assure Members that my speech will not be as long as that of the
              last Member. First, I want to record my appreciation and thanks to
              the Committee and research staff for all the work and help that
              they give to the Committee.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are probably a number of points in this
              that could be welcomed. I agreed with Mr Ken Robinson when he
              talked about bereavement support payment and the less restrictive
              method of determining psychological injuries. However, overall I
              believe that NIO cynically used the Kenneth Bloomfield review on
              victims, which reported in July 1999, as an opportunity for a
              cost- cutting exercise on the criminal injuries system.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The introduction of the tariff system for
              injuries received cross-party and unanimous opposition in the
              Committee. It is unfair and inflexible, as it does not take into
              consideration an individual’s particular circumstances. In most
              cases it would have the effect of reducing the amount of
              compensation to a fixed level. There is a sliding downward scale
              of compensation for multiple injuries, and the whole system is not
              index-linked but subject to a review in three years. The tariff
              system is already in place in Britain. It has been a source of
              controversy there, and there is general unhappiness with it.
              Indeed, the appeals panel has overturned in the region of 70% of
              the original decisions, which shows just how flawed the original
              process was. We should not take the view that because a system is
              in place in Britain, we must slavishly follow it here.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">NIO then went on to argue that the introduction
              of a tariff-based scheme will so simplify the process that it will
              not require the services of a legal professional. Instead, Victim
              Support can do the job previously done by solicitors. I am sure
              that everyone here will agree that Victim Support does an
              excellent job helping victims of crime and the trauma that
              entails. However, I do not believe that it has the resources, the
              capacity, or the required legal background to fulfil the role that
              solicitors do. Victim Support has eight offices throughout the
              North of Ireland, with three full-time staff in each, and in the
              region of 200 volunteers whose hours vary from a few per week
              upwards. The intention is to recruit nine extra advice workers and
              about 100 extra volunteers. None of the people who work for Victim
              Support has legal qualifications, so compare that with the number
              of solicitors throughout the North of Ireland.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.45 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are over 600 practising solicitors in the
              North of Ireland, who are easily accessible and have offices in
              all towns. If someone is a victim of crime, he or she can go to a
              solicitor for help and advice.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In tandem with these proposals, the NIO intends
              to make paid legal assistance unavailable to victims of crime. The
              Ad Hoc Committee objects strongly to that. The NIO is not saying
              that a solicitor cannot be consulted. However, it is removing any
              financial help to do so. Victims must, therefore, pay for legal
              advice, which discriminates against those who are less well off
              and those who are statistically more likely to be the victims of
              crime. It seems that the Government want to pay only lip service
              to equality obligations.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Human Rights Commission and other
              organisations that gave evidence to the Committee raised concerns
              that that may be in breach of international human rights norms for
              the right to legal representation. It appears to be a cynical
              cost-cutting exercise by the British Government and the NIO. It is
              estimated that money will be saved in the long term because of
              reduced compensation costs. It is also estimated that in the
              removal of paid assistance the Government will save £7 million,
              while the cost of enlisting Victim Support would be only £0·4
              million.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There was some improvement in the draft
              legislation on ex-prisoners, particularly those who were
              imprisoned for political reasons, through the removal of the
              explicit and discriminatory block to compensation for those
              convicted under the provisions of emergency law. However,
              considering that the majority of ex-political prisoners were
              sentenced to more than two and a half years’ imprisonment, the
              proposed scheme will make no tangible difference to their
              situation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Secretary of State may also make a decision
              on the basis of other evidence that is available to him or her,
              which raises the prospect of intelligence reports that cannot be
              challenged. Paragraph 38 of the draft legislation, which deals
              with compensation in fatal cases, shows that while the explicit
              disqualification has been removed, implicit disqualification will
              remain. That is contrary to the search for a new, inclusive
              society, particularly when those who were caught up in the
              conflict, and their families, are still being discriminated
              against and punished.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Under the current legislation, and also under
              the proposed legislation, no distinction is made between people
              convicted of ordinary crime and people with political convictions.
              That is wrong. The majority of people who were in jail for
              political reasons would not have seen the inside of a prison but
              for the abnormal political conditions in the North of Ireland. The
              Good Friday Agreement recognises that the conflict was political
              and that it required a political solution. The British Government
              and the NIO should follow that through to its logical conclusion
              and distinguish between political and non-political convictions.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There should be compensation for loss of
              earnings. Awards should not be subject to reductions that take
              social security, healthcare and insurance benefits into account.
              There are problems in the current system with delay, transparency,
              communication and liaison. The legal profession recognises that.
              The Law Society of Northern Ireland has recommended that a working
              party, representing the judiciary, the legal profession, agencies
              and professionals working within the current system, and
              representatives of victims, should be set up to examine ways of
              improving the current system. That is a sensible approach.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to draw attention to wrongful action by
              the NIO in its treatment of the Ad Hoc Committee. When NIO
              representatives were invited to give evidence, the NIO initially
              tried to set the parameters of the debate. It attempted to rap the
              Committee over the knuckles when Committee members raised
              legitimate concerns, as is their right. That behaviour is
              unacceptable.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recommendation 10 of the Committee’s report

              should not use the new political dispensation to ride roughshod
              over the rights of people who are the victims of crime.</p>

              comments of my learned Friend, the Member for North Belfast, Mr
              Maginness. He is correct that the fundamental principle is whether
              a tariff system should be used at all.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The use of a tariff system is fundamentally
              inequitable, because it treats individuals as a number each time
              and implies that every person’s injury can be treated in the
              same way. That is absurd, and the Government should look at the
              comments of the House again. This is not an acceptable piece of
              legislation in its current form.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a caveat to that. I disagree with the
              Committee to some extent with regard to recommendation 5 in which
              the Committee suggests that the Secretary of State should not
              regard a person’s criminal record when determining a reward when
              that person’s actions, which may be indicative of that record,
              cannot be shown to be responsible for the act of criminal violence
              that resulted in the injuries for which compensation is sought.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I disagree. A person’s past behaviour — in
              particular criminal convictions for serious offences — should be
              taken into consideration. If a person’s behaviour in the past is
              indicative of a particular lifestyle which results in serious
              criminal injury, I am not comfortable with the concept that
              taxpayers should have to compensate him for having placed himself
              in that position.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, I can see the problem with that.
              Having to demonstrate that a person is responsible for the act of
              criminal violence that resulted in the injuries is almost
              impossible unless it is somebody with a record of grievous bodily
              harm who starts a fight, gets injured and tries to claim
              compensation. Clearly that person is responsible.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, a serial burglar’s house may be
              burgled. He goes downstairs to confront the intruder and is
              injured, but the test should not apply, because he did not ask to
              be burgled. However, I do have a difficulty with saying that
              taxpayers should be forced to compensate somebody whose activities
              in the past were clearly antisocial and who does not deserve
              compensation, so I have some difference with the Committee.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What would the Member say if a person were
              involved in some petty crime in his youth then lived a normal
              life, but after 20 years something happened, and he submitted a
              claim for compensation? Would that person, in the Member’s
              opinion, have disqualified himself twenty years ago?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dalton:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No, I would not suggest to the House that any
              conviction of any sort should automatically disbar a person from
              receiving some form of compensation. Obviously it is something
              that must be taken into account; the individual circumstances of
              each person must be taken into account.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, it is right that the Secretary of
              State should retain a degree of discretion. Where a person’s
              behaviour and criminal convictions demonstrate a particular type
              of lifestyle — where that person is clearly involved in criminal
              activity on a constant and ongoing basis — they should not be
              eligible for criminal compensation. If a drug-dealing gangster
              such as Johnny Adair gets beaten over the head, there is no way
              that honest, decent taxpayers should have to foot the bill for
              compensation for someone like that. That is the position that I
              would take. It should not necessarily be applied to a person who,
              for instance, commits a minor offence as a youth. We can all
              perform indiscretions in our youth, and I do not see that that
              should have such a serious and deleterious effect on a person’s
              entire life.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would, however, make some distinction in
              relation to very serious offences, even those committed at an
              early age. I have a huge amount of sympathy for Mr Creighton’s
              position, but I have some difficulty with the idea of somebody who
              was convicted of so serious an offence as throwing a petrol bomb
              at age 18 receiving compensation. When one looks at the
              devastation, mayhem and death that has been caused by petrol bombs
              in our society, one should realise that the consequences of
              throwing that petrol bomb — for the thrower, as well as those on
              the receiving end — could be life-altering. For that person, it
              is life-altering in the sense that they place themselves outside a
              particular category of our society. Where someone performs an act
              that is so damaging to society in general — an act that can
              cause death — that person should not receive compensation at a
              later stage. However, I broadly support the recommendations of the
              Committee.</p>

              The comments that I made earlier on tariffs were correct. You
              cannot treat injuries of a similar nature caused to different
              people in the same way. It is completely unreasonable to accept
              that the loss of an eye for one person is the same as the loss of
              an eye for another. If I were to have my legs injured, it probably
              would not be that deleterious to my lifestyle, but if Joe Brolly
              were to have his legs broken, it would probably be severely
              deleterious to his lifestyle — and probably also to his team’s
              performance. Obviously, you must take into account the individual’s
              circumstances and their lifestyle. That cannot be done under a
              tariff system, so for that reason I agree with the general thrust
              of the report.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I
              commend the work done by the Committee staff, the Committee
              members and those who attended all the meetings. Considerable
              effort was needed to complete the work by the date that was given.
              I commend that and welcome the report, its findings and its
              proposals to Government.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most of the points have already been covered.
              The purpose of the Bloomfield Report was to deal with criminal
              injuries in a normal situation — or &quot;normality&quot;, as it
              is often called — and not the kind of situation that we have had
              here over the last long number of years. Therefore, I take issue
              with the point that you cannot make distinctions between
              particular injuries.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.00 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The purpose of injuries compensation is to
              allow a person, injured through any situation, to get his or her
              life back on track again. The abnormal situation that we have
              lived through here must be taken into account. It is different to
              what would generally be covered by such a scheme. The Committee
              recommended a fairer, more equitable, open and transparent system.
              However, that is not what the Government are offering us. The
              introduction of the tariff system, and the independent appeals
              panel, has been mentioned, and the role of the panel and the
              people who are likely to have recourse to it have been outlined.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The removal of paid legal assistance is of
              particular concern; it is to be replaced by help from Victim
              Support. Support from a local solicitor was always something that
              people could depend on, whether they were facing a tribunal, an
              independent panel or anything else. The solicitor is usually on
              the side of the applicant or the person defending himself. That
              does not always happen in tribunals. Those dealing with appeals or
              tribunals in relation to disability living allowance, or other
              such allowances, become desensitised to the interests of the
              individual. That could happen in criminal injuries appeals. The
              whole system would therefore work against the individual and the
              individual’s ability to defend himself. People who have gone
              through trauma are not in a strong position to defend themselves.
              You would need to bring a couple of barristers with you to most
              tribunals just to survive and get through them or to get any
              compensation. I am not sure that that is the way to go.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are positive aspects, and they have been
              mentioned. The Committee seemed to be almost totally opposed to
              the recommendations by the Government from the start. The
              Government are looking for a back-door method of cost saving and
              cost cutting, and they are using the Bloomfield report as a way of
              doing that. My Colleague Dara O’Hagan mentioned that we should
              not have to rigidly adhere to what they do across the water. That
              system was not right for us. I see no reason why we cannot have a
              system of our own, or why we cannot improve on the system that is
              already there and that is of benefit to individuals. We should
              take a proper look at that, rather than have a straightforward
              cost-saving exercise, which seems to be the sole intent of the
              Government.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The individual is losing out in cases involving
              trauma and physical or psychological injury. Cases should be dealt
              with on an individual basis, and, as has been mentioned, they
              should not be given bar codes. For example, a rape attack could
              impact on a person’s future career and whether she could
              continue with that career. The consequential loss of earnings over
              the next few years, or damage to career prospects, is not
              compensated for. The person could lose a huge amount of money
              under the proposed system. We have been told that there is no
              upper limit, but I do not believe that, and solicitors do not
              believe it either. People will lose out badly.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have agreed that paid legal assistance
              should continue to be available to people who wish to make
              application for compensation. The large number of people applying
              was mentioned. Often it is those who are most in need who are
              least able to pay for assistance. They probably are the majority
              of those applying. The Secretary of State, despite having some
              arbitrary powers, has not dealt with very many cases. That can
              hardly be considered an extra benefit.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is also the question of deductions from
              the compensation to those who receive benefits or who have
              received a payment for health or other insurance. That poses the
              question of whether those on benefits enjoy equality with those
              who are in full-time employment.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with recommendation 10 that the
              proposed legislation should not be introduced at this time. That
              is the key message for the Government. They must reconsider the
              situation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It must be recognised that Victim Support
              Northern Ireland’s original role was an important one. However,
              I am not sure that it can fulfil this role. In practice, it may be
              very difficult. That is for Victim Support Northern Ireland to
              sort out for itself.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issue of prisoners is very important to us.
              Submissions that we received show that in a fair and just
              compensation system singling out people with convictions is
              unfair, unjust and a denial of basic human rights. For years,
              ex-prisoners have suffered discrimination and have had claims
              denied solely because they were ex-prisoners. Whether or not the
              victim of a criminal injury has a previous conviction should not
              be taken into account when his or her claim is being assessed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Various types of crimes have been mentioned. I
              know of one person whose house was burned but who received no
              compensation because that person had a conviction for a traffic
              offence. Members may check the statistics if they so wish, but
              this is not simply about political prisoners: it affects people at
              all levels. Many people who have previous convictions have gone on
              to lead constructive lives. Should they be victims of criminal
              injury in future they will also be denied compensation. That is
              wrong. We should have a system that is different and that does not
              simply follow what has gone before. Go raibh maith agat.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several useful points were made about the
              anomalies in the Criminal Injuries (Compensation) (Northern
              Ireland) Order 1988. Indeed, various victims’ organisations made
              those same points in Sir Kenneth Bloomfield’s first report, ‘We
              Will Remember Them’. That was taken up when the compensation
              payments were reviewed. Some of those points concerned the use of
              language. The bereavement payment was always seen as offensive to
              victims and was misunderstood as a consequence. Therefore it was
              crucial that the word &quot;support&quot; was introduced. The
              extension of the bereavement support payment to those who are
              considered to be partners is extremely important.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There was unanimous support in the Committee
              for updating our legislation. There are anomalies in the Criminal
              Injuries (Compensation) (Northern Ireland) Order 1988, and the
              victims themselves are best able to point them out. One anomaly
              that is constantly highlighted is the treatment of those who
              suffer trauma and psychological injury as a result of witnessing a
              traumatic incident or who are present at the scene of a crime.
              They may not have been compensated but may endure a great deal of
              pain and mental illness as a consequence of what they have seen.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Over the years, survivors in Northern Ireland
              have made that point. Many have said that they should have been
              compensated for what they had observed and endured because it took
              an enormous toll on their ability to continue with work and on
              their ability to remain as they had been before.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Any new legislation is a concern, and, as other
              Members have said, there is no need to abolish something that only
              needed to be amended. The current legislation should be amended in
              a way that takes cognisance of the fact that those who are present
              at the scene of a crime should be eligible for compensation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In a country such as Northern Ireland, where
              mental illness has been treated as so insignificant in the past,
              it is even more important that the terms &quot;mental
              illness&quot; and &quot;psychological injury&quot; are to be
              extended and moved beyond the simple descriptions of
              &quot;disorders&quot;. Therefore psychological symptoms such as
              anxiety, tension, insomnia, irritability, loss of confidence,
              agoraphobia and preoccupation with thoughts of guilt and self-
              harm will be included under the terms of compensation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Anyone who has spoken to a survivor of a
              terrible incident will have observed the guilt that that victim
              suffers because he or she has survived while others have died or
              been terribly injured. Therefore it is important that feelings of
              guilt that lead to mental illness, depression and loss of
              confidence are acknowledged as a cause of psychological injury and
              that such injury be included under the terms of compensation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The third anomaly to be addressed — and which
              should have been addressed before now — is time limitations,
              particularly in child sex abuse cases. That is also a welcome
              change. The legislation should have been amended, and it is good
              that that point was picked up. Members must remember that the
              terms of reference are concerned not only with victims of the
              troubles, but also with victims in other areas. In many cases
              child sex abuse victims want to lock away the memory of what they
              endured, and it is only in their adolescence or as they approach
              the years beyond 18 that the memory of those events returns to
              them. Because of the time limitations in place, those victims were
              prohibited from claiming. Therefore it is good that that statutory
              limitation has been lifted.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, it is possible to amend the
              legislation to take on board all of those changes. As other
              Members have said, the Assembly should not be abolishing access to
              legal aid, the appeals to the courts and compensation based on
              individual cases.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An example from current English case law will
              illustrate exactly what would happen here if the Assembly were to
              introduce the new scheme. Tariffs will be introduced under the
              schemes that are currently operating in England. The Northern
              Ireland criminal injuries compensation scheme 2002, which was
              presented to the Committee, lays out exactly how much a victim
              would receive for a finger injury, a broken arm, rape, sex
              assault, or any other injury.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Caroline Fairfax was raped at knifepoint by a
              serial rapist called Stefan Molliere. In the attack she was
              punched and badly beaten. Under the criminal injury compensation
              scheme of tariffs, she was awarded £7,500. She believed that that
              was an insult to all rape victims. She said that the attack almost
              ruined her life; it caused her to give up work; she had to move
              house; and, similar to many victims, she required counselling. The
              price put on a rape at knifepoint — by which she was also
              severely injured — was £7,500. There are many other similar
              cases in England where the tariff system is operating.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I urge Members not to let such a system be
              introduced to Northern Ireland. This afternoon I tried to compare
              what tariffs different injuries would equate to.</p>
              <i>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Under the proposed system the loss of a finger
              in an attack would cost the Northern Ireland Office up to
              £18,000. However, victims of severe sexual abuse lasting over
              three years — as there is a stipulation about how long the abuse
              may have lasted — with all the associated distress and mental
              illness would receive exactly the same amount. How can anyone
              decide that the loss of a single finger is the equivalent to
              sexual abuse that took place over three years? It is important to
              point out that each case should be decided on its individual
              merit. Therefore there is a reason for good legal advice.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Herein lies the criticism of the current system
              and why it needed to be changed. The current system is not
              transparent, and it is not sufficiently accountable. Therefore
              victims made an enormous number of complaints about that system.
              It could be made much more transparent and could be amended so
              that those victims understand what their rights may be.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Victims should also be entitled to appeal to
              the courts, so the loss of legal assistance is a concern.
              Undoubtedly, and other Members have mentioned this, there is the
              right to receive support from Victim Support Northern Ireland.
              However, that organisation made the point that one should look at
              what Kenneth Bloomfield referred to as less serious injuries and
              those that are more serious. Victim Support Northern Ireland is on
              record in Committee as saying that it would be in a position to
              look at the less serious injuries and assist people in that
              category. There is more legal complexity when one is addressing
              multiple injuries and more serious injuries.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Considering these serious points of view
              regarding compensation for criminal injury, the Committee was
              unanimous that this particular piece of legislation should not go
              forward. Members have addressed other issues that would lead to
              inequity. The withdrawal of benefits and the paying back of some
              benefits are two such issues. Currently, that is not that the
              case. However, if it were, it would be seen as a step backwards
              and not as an improvement.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These are the major points, and ultimately I
              would argue that discretion and flexibility should always be seen
              positively, not negatively. It is not too difficult to take cases
              individually. As we make the transformation from conflict into, we
              hope, a more peaceful society it would be nothing short of a
              disgrace if the Assembly were to support the current proposals.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr R Hutchinson:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have had a relatively easy job today in that
              all of the Members who spoke were in support of the
              recommendations that the Committee has made. Therefore there are
              no questions that I need to answer, except perhaps the one that my
              Colleague from South Antrim, Mr Dalton, raised in his address to
              the Assembly. It is only fair to point out that the Committee’s
              recommendation that he spoke about only extends to cases where the
              actions of the victim in no way contribute to his or her injuries.
              It was the Committee’s view that if the perpetrator of a crime
              were injured then it is right that he or she should not be
              compensated for those injuries.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank everyone who took part in the debate
              for their contributions. I thank the members of the Ad Hoc
              Committee for their input during the weeks that we met. There has
              been a fair amount of unity in what we have said, what we have
              done and the work we have produced. I want to thank the Assembly
              Research and Library Services for its assistance, and I owe a debt
              of gratitude to the Committee Clerks who assisted us in our
              meetings over the past weeks.</p>
