    <p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="1"></a>Ministerial Statement</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">British-Irish Council: &nbsp;Energy Ministers&rsquo; Meeting</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I have received notice from the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment that she  wishes to make a statement.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment (Mrs Foster)</strong>: With your permission, Mr Speaker, I wish to make a  statement in compliance with section 52 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998  regarding a meeting of the British-Irish Council energy Ministers. The  statement has been agreed with junior Minister Gerry Kelly, and I make it on  behalf of us both.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The meeting was held on Monday 22 March 2010 between 9.00  am and 12.00 noon at Church House, Westminster, London. The Executive  were represented by junior Minister Gerry Kelly and me, attending by video conference  from Netherleigh House. The UK  Government were represented by Lord Hunt of Kings Heath, Minister of State at  the Department of Energy and Climate Change, who chaired the meeting. The Irish  Government were represented by Eamon Ryan TD, Minister for Communications,  Energy, and Natural Resources. A full list of delegates is appended to the  written copy of this statement, which was circulated to Members in advance of  the sitting.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The British-Irish Council was established under the Good  Friday Agreement as a forum for its members to work together on matters of  mutual interest within their respective competencies. The energy sectoral group  was established at the British-Irish Council summit meeting on 20 February 2009  and includes an electricity grid infrastructure subgroup led by the UK  Government, through the Department of Energy and Climate Change, and a marine  renewables subgroup led by the Scottish Government. The sectoral group&rsquo;s task  was to consider and report back to the British-Irish Council ministerial summit  on relevant energy matters of mutual interest that affect British-Irish Council  members.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At the meeting on 22 March 2010, progress was noted on a  number of specific areas of work that could be taken forward over the coming  months in the grid infrastructure and marine energy subgroups. It was agreed  that energy is vital to all our jurisdictions and that there are many areas of  mutual interest that offer opportunities for collaboration to help meet  challenging European Union energy targets. Ministers agreed that the subgroups  should report progress on both work streams to the next BIC summit, which is  planned for June 2010 in Guernsey.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Ministers considered the discussion paper that was prepared  by the electricity grid infrastructure subgroup and was presented by Lord Hunt.  Discussion centred on identifying key areas for consideration and information  exchange and the subgroup&rsquo;s future work programme. Andy Hiorns of National Grid  and Andrew Cooke of EirGrid also gave presentations to Ministers on grid  infrastructure developments in the UK  and Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Ministers agreed that the British-Irish Council grid  subgroup would focus its work on the following areas: exchanging information  and experience of research and development and other studies to promote greater  understanding and co-operation in electricity grid infrastructure; sharing  experience of and approaches to the regulation and planning consenting of  electricity grid infrastructure to promote best practice and effective decision  making within and, where relevant, between BIC members; and working together to  exert greater influence on the direction of emerging EU policy on grid  infrastructure and to leverage maximum EU funding, where applicable to relevant  members, from EU sources for grid infrastructure develop&shy;ments and projects of  mutual interest. In endorsing those areas for future discussion, Ministers  recognised the existing co-operation between British-Irish Council members.  They agreed that the British-Irish Council has an important role to play in  furthering understanding and sharing experience to assist in meeting the  challenges from climate change and maintaining security of energy supply.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Jim Mather, Minister for Enterprise, Energy and Tourism in the  Scottish Government, gave a presentation on the work that is being undertaken  by the marine renewables energy subgroup. That ministerial group has discussed  marine planning and policy, research activity, initiatives in the marine energy  areas and the scope for and benefits of greater exploitation of marine energy  resources across British-Irish Council member Administrations. Ministers  welcomed the group&rsquo;s progress and future work plan, which includes dialogue  with the European Commission on its funding and policy initiatives. Ministers  also noted that marine energy will be the theme of the next British-Irish  Council ministerial summit, where the subgroup&rsquo;s recommendations will be  discussed. A presentation will be delivered at that plenary session on the  marine renewable opportunities within the Channel Islands.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Junior Minister Kelly and I endorsed both papers as being a  sensible way to proceed to help Northern    Ireland to meet its challenging renewable  energy targets for 2020. Ministers recognised that careful attention would be  required to address environmental and public concerns on the development and  location of future energy infrastructure. There are many economic and  environmental benefits for the people of these islands in the use of new  sustainable generating technologies. It was recognised by Ministers that Northern Ireland  has already demonstrated such benefits. For example, Lord Hunt agreed that the  development of the SeaGen tidal wave project at Strangford Lough is a  particular exemplar of the way in which a range of energy and environmental  policy objectives can be addressed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The two papers reflect the useful discussions between  officials over the past year and will send a strong message to the European  Union on our co-operation and determination to deliver a robust and sustainable  energy infrastructure across the British Isles.  Minister Kelly and I welcome the proposals, as they will enhance opportunities  for economic growth and green job creation, strengthen security of supply and  help reduce fuel poverty by increasing the diversity of energy sources. They  will also support Northern    Ireland in engaging and influencing the  regional energy agenda, especially in relation to the wider European Union  drive on security of supply, climate change and economic recovery.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We commend the work of the British-Irish Council to date in  developing its energy work stream to the Northern Ireland Assembly.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Campbell</strong>:  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement. The issue of renewable energy regularly  concentrates minds, and rightly so. The Minister referred to the targets for  the next 10 years. Will she indicate to the House the need to take account of  widespread consultations, particularly around the north coast, when considering  the development of offshore wind farms, which have raised a lot of objection in  the past?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment</strong>: During the summit, a good deal of time  was spent talking about the need to gain the public&rsquo;s acceptance of proposals  and, indeed, to ensure better understanding of the need to have renewable  energy sources and grid infrastructure, as Members can imagine.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We had a long discussion about how we need to engage with  the public to explain what is going on with renewables and grid infrastructure.  We looked to other member Administrations to learn from their experiences. Scotland has  been involved in quite a bit of planning for an interconnector that has been  put in place there and was recently approved by the relevant Minister. We can  learn a lot of lessons from the experience there. Some of those lessons are  good, and we will learn from them. However, we also want to learn about what  went wrong. It is a hugely important area, and it is important to bring the  public with us when we are talking about energy infrastructure and renewables.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for her  statement. My question is about wind generation for electricity. To date, the  single electricity market in Ireland  has been quite successful, and hopefully it will be in the future. There are  also longer-term plans for a European single electricity market. I agree with  the public&rsquo;s concerns about where the particular infrastructure for that would  be put, which needs to be planned. There is the potential for us to become  exporters, because, obviously, wind cannot be stored.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member should come to her question.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  Sorry. Was any thought given to that at the meeting?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: Grid infrastructure, which is a huge issue for us, was the  principal issue that was discussed. Marine energy was discussed only latterly.  We wanted to talk about the grid infrastructure not just on the island of  Ireland but for the rest of the UK, what was happening there and what was  happening at a European regional level. The Republic&rsquo;s Minister for  Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Eamon Ryan, talked a lot about  why it was so important to have the new interconnector between Wales and the Republic of Ireland.  As the Member knows, we have the Moyle interconnector with Scotland. That  is incredibly important for us, because, although we take energy from Scotland at  times, there are also times when we export. It is important that we have that  interconnectedness to enable us to export.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member is right: there are times when we have a lot of  wind. I do not know whether the Member has had the chance to visit SONI, but  down there one can see the amount of wind power that is coming in at any one  time. It fluctuates greatly. There is a need for us to have the infrastructure  to deal with that issue. As the Member knows, an all-Ireland grid study was  carried out, and it looked at how much capacity we could cope with. It said  that we could take 42% of our renewables onto that grid infrastructure.  Therefore, we need to look at our grid. It is going to involve huge capital  expenditure moving forward, and we need to plan it in such a way that consumers  are not hit with disproportionate costs when it comes to the point of expanding  our grid. The Member will also know that we very much want to move ahead with  our second interconnector, and the ice storms that we had in March point to the  reason for that.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>: The  Minister is aware of the electricity grid weakness in the west of the Province  and the high cost of reinforcing it. Was that issue raised at the meeting?  Furthermore, in the context of adding wind generators, was the Minister able to  identify any EU funding that could be accessed to assist with the reinforcement  of the grid in the west?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: The west was not specifically mentioned at the meeting. We were  looking at grid infrastructure more from a strategic point of view. We will  certainly be looking to all sources of funding to strengthen the grid. Indeed,  I understand that the new interconnector between the Republic  of Ireland and Wales benefits  from the European Union in that about one fifth of the cost comes from European  funding. Therefore, we will be looking at that. As the most peripheral part of Europe, we have a strong case for capital expenditure if  we want to raise the standard of our grid and meet the European Union targets.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s commitment to sustainable energy and, in particular,  to tackling climate change. I hope that she is successful in advocating that  position more widely in her party.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to ask about tidal and other forms of sea current  generation. Can the Minister report on any further proposals to take new  projects beyond the one that has, to date, been relatively successful in  Strangford Lough?</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">10.45 am</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: In respect of the SeaGen project in Strangford Lough, it is  very gratifying to hear something within one&rsquo;s own jurisdiction being referred  to at a British-Irish Council meeting as an exemplar, so we should be rightly  proud of what has happened with the marine current turbine in Strangford Lough.  The Member may be aware that we are finalising our draft offshore renewable  strategy. Subsequently, when we have identified places that are suitable for  offshore renewables, we hope to put out a call for projects.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is a hugely exciting time for energy. I listened to the  other member Administrations represented at the meeting, and it is clear that  they are pushing ahead. We need to push ahead as well, because we cannot be  left behind, especially given that we have such a marvellous resource off the  coast of Northern Ireland.  I very much want to see us moving ahead, but we can only do so in partnership,  because we only have jurisdiction of tidal waters up to 12 miles out, beyond  which one enters territory in which one has to deal with the Crown Estate.  Nevertheless, we will move ahead because there are huge opportunities, not just  in the renewable energy field. Invest Northern Ireland is looking at how we can  capitalise on what is going on in renewables, so that we might get more  manufacturing jobs and benefit from the design end of things. Yes, we are  certainly forging ahead in that area.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Neeson</strong>:  The Minister will be pleased to learn that the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment met at  Castlereagh House last week, and the time that we spent in the control room was  interesting.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We recognise the impact that the EU will have on energy  policy. What plans do both jurisdictions have to discuss energy issues with the  European Commissioner for Energy?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: The Member is right to identify the European Union as an area  on which we need to concentrate. I was not aware that members of the Committee  had been to Castlereagh House, but I am glad that they were there, because it  is a magnificent facility. It is quite scary to see all the lights and so  forth. Nevertheless, it is a good facility &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Neeson</strong>:  At least they were on.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: That is right. I am not sure that I would have liked being  there on the Tuesday before Easter, when things might have been a little more  frantic.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Towards the end of the meeting, we discussed the need to  work collaboratively in order to make a case to the European Union on issues  such as grid infrastructure and renewables. Obviously, some jurisdictions that  were at the British-Irish Council meeting do not benefit from European Union  membership, particularly the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, but they want  to work with us on European Union matters in order to benefit from being part  of the British-Irish Council. The meeting was excellent, and I am looking forward  to going to the next summit in Guernsey.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  thank the Minister for her statement. On the issue of energy co-operation, will  the Minister update Members on the latest position on the North/South  interconnector? It appears that some Members opposite do not have a great deal  of enthusiasm for it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: As one would expect, at the meeting, both the Irish Government  and ourselves mentioned having the second interconnector in place. I am not  going to talk about the route or planning consent. Suffice it to say that we  recognised the need to engage with the public so that they understand why we  need to have it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The ice storm of the Tuesday before Easter illustrated why  we need the second interconnector. I am not sure whether Members realise that,  at various stages throughout that evening, SONI lost three of the four 275 kV  lines from Ballylumford, all four lines from Kilroot and the two lines into  Coolkeeragh. In addition, the two cables comprising the Moyle interconnector  were also lost at times and had to be put on again very quickly. Most of those  faults were caused by the system tripping as a result of ice accretion, a term  that I had never heard of before 30 March 2010. Most faults were repaired  quickly, but a number reoccurred as ice build-up continued on the line.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The capacity of the North/South 275 kilovolt interconnector  may have been inadequate to handle power flows from the Republic if the  compounded impacts of those faults had continued. If that had happened, the  system would have started to shed load. Blocks of customers would have been  taken offline in order to avoid total shutdown. Therefore, parts of Northern Ireland  could have been left in darkness. There is real strategic need for that second  interconnector. I hope that every Member recognises that need. If so, we can  discuss all the other issues.</p>
    <p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="2"></a>Executive Committee Business</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Unsolicited Services (Trade and Business Directories)  Bill: Second Stage</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment (Mrs Foster)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That the Second Stage of the Unsolicited Services (Trade and  Business Directories) Bill [NIA12/09] be agreed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It may be helpful to the Assembly if I begin by outlining  the background to the Bill. Before I do that, I thank the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and  Investment for its helpful scrutiny and advice during the development of the  Bill and the policy that lies behind it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill re-enacts, with amendments, the provisions of the  Unsolicited Goods and Services (Northern    Ireland) Order 1976 in respect of charges  for entries into business or trade directories. One reason for the 1976 Order  was to regulate the circumstances in which businesses could be charged for  publication of entries about them in directories. Before the 1976 Order became  law, unwary businesses could be tricked by various sharp practices into paying  for directory entries that they had not requested and did not want.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill is a technical measure that consolidates the law  in that area and removes provisions that my Department believes are burdensome  and unnecessary for businesses. It also removes anomalies. It is intended that  the Bill will enable businesses to improve efficiency by relaxing and  simplifying arrangements for repeats and renewals of directory entries and by  putting in place arrangements for sending order forms electronically and  requirements that cover the form and content of invoices and other documents.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill has been drafted to ensure that the law in Northern Ireland  continues to provide existing safeguards for business against certain  deceptions that are practised in relation to the publication of real or  pretended directory products. The Bill will also bring Northern Ireland  into line with the law in GB and ensure that there is compliance with article  9(1) of the European Commission e-commerce directive.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The equivalent in Great Britain of the 1976 Order is  the Unsolicited Goods and Services Act 1971. The Bill will amend the 1976 Order  to similar effect to amendments that were made to the 1971 Act by two Statutory  Instruments that were passed in 2005. To ensure that there is compliance with  article 9 of the e-commerce directive, an amendment to the law is required to  create an electronic equivalent of a business order form. That could have been  achieved by the Department making regulations under section 2(2) of the  European Communities Act 1972 to amend the 1976 Order in a similar way to the  Unsolicited Goods and Services Act 1971 (Electronic Commerce) (Amendment)  Regulations 2005. However, the authorities in Great Britain considered that the  1971 Act should be amended at the same time in order to relax the existing  requirements under which clients renew or extend existing contracts for entries  in a directory and to simplify requirements as to the form and content of  certain documents that relate to contracts for directory entries. That was  achieved by the Regulatory Reform (Unsolicited Goods and Services Act 1971)  (Directory Entries and Demands for Payment) Order 2005. That Order was made under  the Regulatory Reform Act 2001, which does not apply to Northern Ireland  legislation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My Department wishes to ensure that Northern Ireland businesses have the same  benefits and protections in this area of law as those in the rest of the United Kingdom.  Accordingly, I decided to introduce a Bill to the Assembly. The Great Britain  Statutory Instruments were constrained by limited powers to make them  consistent with the Regulatory Reform Act 2001 and the European Communities Act  1972. An Assembly Bill is not similarly constrained. Therefore, the Bill will  restate the law, with amendments that are similar to those that were made by  the recent Great Britain Statutory Instruments, in a consolidated and more  readily understood form. If Members have followed that, they have done very  well.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill before the House, although different in structure,  will have exactly the same legal effect as the Act that applies to Great Britain,  as amended. The Department considers that anyone who complies with the law in  GB will comply with the law in Northern    Ireland, as set out in the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My Department carried out extensive consultation on the  Bill. During the process of policy development, the Department agreed with the  Committee for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment that the Department should contact certain organisations  to offer additional briefing during consultation. That was done, and we took  steps to specifically offer additional briefing to the Northern Ireland Chamber  of Commerce and the Northern Ireland  branches of the Institute   of Directors, the  Federation of Small Businesses and the Confederation of British Industry. None  of those organisations had any concerns with the proposals, and they have  welcomed the Bill. The Federation of Small Businesses in Northern Ireland has welcomed the simplification  of the law, the elimination of burdensome and unnecessary procedures and the  bringing of Northern Ireland  law into line with that in Great    Britain.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will summarise the content of the Bill. The Bill has nine  clauses and one schedule, which make minor and consequential amendments.  Clauses 1 to 6 are equivalent to section 3 of the 1971 Act that applies to Great Britain,  as amended by recent Statutory Instruments, but restated in a separate form.  That approach removes the need for unnecessary cross-referencing, and the text  has been consolidated and simplified.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 1 imposes a general prohibition on charges, unless  the requirements of clauses 2, 3, 4 and 5 are met. Clause 2 sets out the  requirements relating to a signed order form for a trade or business directory  entry note of agreement. Clause 3 deals with the requirements for signed notes  of agreement. Clause 4 applies requirements to certain cases of electronic  communication. Clause 5 permits charges in certain cases of renewed or extended  contracts. Clause 6 makes it an offence for anyone to demand payment unless the  requirements of clauses 2, 3, 4 or 5 are met. Clause 7 states that my  Department will have the power to amend the schedule to the Bill by Order,  subject to negative resolution. An Order under that clause may also make any  necessary transitional provisions and amendments to provisions that are  referred to in the schedule. The schedule sets out certain matters that are  included in documents that are referred to in clauses 3, 4 and 5. Clause 8  makes consequential amendments and repeals certain provisions of the 1976  Order.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In summary, I believe that the Bill will ensure compliance  with the European Union e-commerce directive and will facilitate electronic  commerce by introducing equivalence between paper-based and electronic methods  for contracting an entry in a directory. The Bill also updates the law to  reflect modern commercial realities of the directory-publishing industry, while  ensuring that legislation continues to provide protection for businesses  against a number of scams.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment (Mr A Maginness)</strong>: I welcome the Unsolicited Services  (Trade and Business Directories) Bill and the opportunity to contribute to the  debate. The Department has kept the Committee fully informed throughout the  process of developing the Bill to this stage, and I thank the Minister for  that. The Committee is grateful to the Minister and her officials for the  comprehensive and timely briefings that it has received.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Dallat] in the Chair)<span style="font-style:normal; "> </span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill&rsquo;s purpose is to update legislation controlling the  circumstances in which businesses can be charged for the publication of entries  about them in business directories. It relaxes and simplifies arrangements for  repeat and renewal directory entries, arrangements for sending order forms  electronically and requirements covering the form and the content of invoices and  other documents. The Committee recognises that the changes are technical, minor  and non-controversial, and that is reflected in the responses to the  Department&rsquo;s consultation.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.00 am</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The most noticeable response was that of the Federation of  Small Businesses, which welcomed the simplification of the law and the  elimination of what it saw as burdensome and unnecessary procedures. It went on  to say that the Bill may provide an opportunity to raise awareness of the  practices against which the Bill will provide protection, and I certainly hope  that that will be the case.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment supports the  principles of the Bill. It will consider its proposals further during the  evidence gathering process.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>: I  also welcome the Second Stage of the Unsolicited Services (Trade and Business  Directories) Bill, although it is a great pity that it does not have a shorter  title. As mentioned, the Bill is a relatively straightforward piece of  legislation that will bring Northern    Ireland into line with GB and ensure  compliance with the European Community&rsquo;s e-commerce directive.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The provisions of the Bill control the circumstances in which  businesses may be charged for the publication of entries about them in  directories, helping to ensure that that process is transparent and that  businesses know what they are getting up front. It will also improve efficiency  by relaxing and simplifying arrangements for repeats and renewals of directory  entries, and it will help to simplify arrangements for sending order forms  electronically and the requirements covering the form and content of invoices.  Therefore, the Bill will be a welcome assistance to businesses in Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, it is somewhat disappointing that the Bill was not  introduced earlier. It reflects corresponding legislation in Great Britain  that was introduced in 2005 and it will fulfil our European obligations. It is  no secret that we have had significant problems in fulfilling our European  obligations in other areas. Therefore, I would have thought that the Minister  would have considered a simpler procedure to be a higher priority.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Last month, it was brought to the attention of the  Committee for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment that businesses and individuals were being targeted with  fraudulent invoices, a practice that the Bill will go some way to restrict by  helping businesses to identify potentially fraudulent entries in trade  directories. Therefore, it is disappointing that it has taken Northern Ireland five years to catch up with the  rest of the United Kingdom,  and I ask the Minister to inform the House if her Department is not meeting any  other European directive. However, I am happy to support the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: I am very pleased to note the broad support for the proposals  contained in the Bill. Members appreciate that the Bill is a technical measure,  but it is important that we update the law in Northern Ireland to reflect the  commercial realities of the trade and commercial directory publishing industry  in the twenty-first century.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I note Mr Cree&rsquo;s comments, but the Bill only relates to  trade directories and not other directories that he may be referring to. I also  note the comments that he made in the ETI Committee and the comments that my  officials made in response to a press release in February 2010 about Yell,  which had encountered difficulties as invoices purporting to be from the  company were found to be fraudulent. Yell has worked closely with the Trading  Standards Service in the Department after indicating that there were  difficulties. The service continues to work closely with industry and provides  examples of fraudulent invoices on its website to alert businesses to that  potential problem.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In relation to Mr Cree&rsquo;s comments as to why the Bill was  not introduced sooner, I explained in my opening remarks that the process could  not be done by regulation and had to done through a full Bill, because of the  way in which matters were dealt with in GB. That meant that time had to be  found to bring forward the Bill, and, although I understand his comments, there  are no trade publishers in Northern    Ireland and anyone who was affected here  would have been covered by GB law. However, I wanted to bring the matter to the  Floor of the House as soon as possible to deal with the anomaly and gap that  existed, to ensure that if anyone set up a trade publication business in Northern Ireland  we could deal with the issue directly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I said, I am grateful to the Members who have  contributed, not only in the House but at the Committee. I look forward to the  next stage of the Bill&rsquo;s progress through the Assembly, and we look forward to  engaging with the Committee. As the Chairperson recognised, we have consulted  more than is normal for a Bill. I make no apology for that; it is good that we  engage with the industry to show it that we are listening to its concerns, that  we wish to simplify issues for it and that we are dealing with better  regulation issues. That and other issues are of key importance to the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That the Second Stage of the Unsolicited Services  (Trade and Business Directories) Bill [NIA 12/09] be agreed.</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading"><a name="3"></a>Welfare Reform Bill: Second Stage</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development (Ms Ritchie)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That the Second Stage of the Welfare Reform Bill [NIA  13/09] be agreed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Welfare Reform Bill makes provision for Northern Ireland similar to that made for Britain by the  Welfare Reform Act 2009, which received Royal Assent on 12 November 2009. The  Bill will further reform the welfare and benefits systems to improve support  and incentives for people to move from benefits into work and set the scene for  the eventual abolition of income support.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The next stage of reform is about creating a system that  recognises that barriers to work are different for each individual, a system  that is flexible enough to respond with personalised support and a system in  which most people move towards an eventual return to work and are expected to  take up the support that is available to them. We know that that approach works  and that combining rights with responsibilities, having regular contact with  our customers and getting them to think about a return to work can change not  only mindsets and outcomes but lives.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The key provisions in the Bill draw heavily from the report  entitled &lsquo;Realising Potential: A Vision for Personalised Conditionality and  Support&rsquo; by Professor Paul Gregg, which was published alongside the White Paper  &lsquo;Raising expectations and increasing support: reforming welfare for the future&rsquo;  in December 2008. Professor Gregg recommended a system of personalised  conditionality matched by personalised support with virtually everyone who is  of working age and on benefits being expected to take active steps towards  work.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">He identified three broad groups. First are those who are  work-ready. The second group is those for whom an immediate return to work is  not appropriate but for whom working could become a genuine possibility with  time, encouragement and support. That second group is referred to as the  &ldquo;progression to work&rdquo; group. The third group comprises people for whom there  should be no requirements.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The work-ready group comprises people who are on  jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance. Most people who claim jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance leave  benefits in less than two years. Even in the current economic climate, most  leave within six months. However, some people do linger, and we need to build  on the substantial support that we are making available earlier in the  jobseekers&rsquo; regime to minimise the risk that jobseekers will repeatedly cycle  through the system.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is for that reason that the Bill makes provision for a  &ldquo;work for your benefit&rdquo; programme. That programme will be designed to move  jobseekers closer to the labour market, help them to find sustained work in the  open labour market and provide them with the experiences and training that they  need to end the cycle of benefit dependency. Although the Bill makes provision  for the programme, I emphasise that it will be piloted initially in four areas  in Britain.  The introduction of the programme to Northern Ireland and the form that  the programme will take here will be considered following a full evaluation of  those pilots.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The progression to work group will include people in a  work-related activity group who receive employment and support allowance,  partners of certain benefit claimants and lone parents with young children. We  want to ensure that preparation for work becomes a natural progression rather  than a sudden step. The Bill makes provision for a requirement to undertake  work-related activity and for people to be mandated to a specific work-related  activity that is prescribed in an action plan. As with the work for your  benefit scheme, work-related activity will be piloted initially in Britain.  Although the Bill includes provisions for that, its introduction in Northern Ireland  will be considered following a full evaluation of those pilots.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill also contains powers to ensure that people on  employment and support allowance in the work-related activity group undertake  activity that is most appropriate to addressing their individual barriers to  work. Those reforms will deliver better, more flexible and more appropriate  support to people across the spectrum of out-of-work benefits by providing a  personalised model of support and conditionality that is not dependent on the  benefit that a person claims, but on the circumstances in which he or she  claims it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Work-related activity will also be initially piloted in Britain, and its introduction in Northern Ireland  will be considered after a full evaluation of those pilots. There are those  who, rightly, should not be required to look for work or to undertake activity  in order to move closer to the labour market. I am referring to people with  caring responsibilities, those who have a serious illness or disability, and  the parents of very young children. However, many will want to make that  journey, and we must support them in doing so. We must make support better,  more flexible and more suitable for people when they need it. That is what Part  1 of the Bill addresses.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We also want to simplify the benefits system so that it is  easier for people to engage with it. The Bill signals the intention to abolish  income support when resources allow and when it is clear how that change will  fit with other changes that are under way. The aim is to move towards a dual  benefits system for people of working age that is based on the employment and  support allowance, which is specifically for people with a health condition or  disability; and jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, which is for a range of other groups.  People moving from income support to jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance will retain the same  level of conditionality as at present. We also propose to amend the law so that  couples in which one partner is capable of work will make a claim for  jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance. That will ensure that the partner who is closest to the  labour market can access as much support as possible in order to move back into  work. We will not move carers from income support until we have a clear plan  that sets out how we will reform the benefits system over the longer term.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The remaining adult dependency increases in the benefits  system will be abolished, and the contribution conditions for employment and  support allowance and jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance will be more closely aligned.  Powers are being established to improve the delivery of community care grants  and to allow us to provide items, such as white goods, at a much lower cost.  The Bill also contains provisions to extend the circumstances in which payments  on account of benefit can be made. That will allow for advance payments of  benefits to be made to those who are facing hardship while they are waiting for  their first full benefit payment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We will not tolerate violence against benefits office  staff, and we will sanction those who engage in such behaviour. We will also  sanction those who fail to attend their mandatory interviews at jobs and  benefits offices without good reason. Benefit fraud is at a low level, but we  are not complacent, and we will increase the sanctions for those who are found  to have committed it. Later, I will speak about the meeting that I had last  year with Jim Knight, the relevant Minister in Britain, about the issue of  operational flexibility.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Part 2 of the Bill includes provisions for further changes  to child maintenance legislation and builds on those made in the Child  Maintenance and Other Payments Act 2008. That Part of the Bill will assist with  the administration of maintenance payments, extend the offences relating to  information to include a failure to report other changes and circumstances, and  increase the timescale for bringing a prosecution action for providing false  information. Part 3 of the Bill is more general and deals with matters of a  technical nature, such as consequential amendments, repeals and transitional  arrangements.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill represents a way forward. It is designed so that  we can work with people to lift them and their children out of poverty. I am  conscious that some people feel that that should be done when children are aged  seven rather than five. We want to be flexible enough that the requirements  that are placed on people are aligned to their circumstances. People must come  first. The Bill is also designed to ensure that the expectations that we have  of any claimant are realistic and achievable.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We do not want to create a welfare state that punishes  people; we want to create a welfare state that supports people by ensuring that  the safety net is never abolished. However, we must not forget that social  security can be achieved only through co-operation between the Department and  the individual. We are working to provide the help that people need to deal  with the challenges of the recession today, which are particularly pernicious.  However, we are also determined to take this opportunity to help people to  overcome the obstacles that they may face in the future. In other words, we  want to help people to find work, which I acknowledge is difficult in the  current financial circumstances.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.15 am</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill is a key stage in the continuing reform of the  welfare system. I hope that it will allow us to deliver comprehensive reforms  to ensure that the welfare state is supported and expects people to support  themselves. The Bill is not about punishing people for being on benefits. It is  about ensuring that the welfare system provides them with the opportunities  that they need to improve their skills, prepare for work and, where appropriate,  move off benefits and into employment. However, there may be circumstances  where that is not appropriate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Let no one say that a recession is the wrong time to  address welfare reform. It is precisely the current socio-economic climate that  makes reform more urgent, not less.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On 23 July 2009, I met the Minister from the Department for  Work and Pensions in London.  I told him, as I now tell the House, that there are aspects of the Welfare  Reform Bill about which I have some disquiet. I told the Minister that I wanted  to have operational flexibility in Northern Ireland. He agreed to that  and also to look at certain aspects of the Bill. That is why, contrary to the  convention in this House with reference to social security legislation, I  instructed that the Bill be subject to full scrutiny by the Committee for  Social Development.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That is important. Normally, social security legislation  goes through the House according to accelerated passage. In this instance, I  disagreed with that, and, within the Committee, there was a variation of views.  I did it because I wanted to hear the Committee&rsquo;s views on the legislation. If  there are better suggestions about the Bill&rsquo;s operational flexibility which do  not endanger parity or the money that we receive through annually managed  expenditure, I am very happy to hear them. That is what the Committee process  is about, and I want Members to be very aware of that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As the original legislation was made at Westminster, it is important that we  participate there fully in the Committee Stage and in the House of Commons  itself, where it is debated at Second Reading &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is not a laughing matter. It is a serious, practical,  political point that I hope all Members will take note of. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: In conclusion, the Bill is designed to help us further  along the road to a more personalised benefits system and ensures that parents  take full responsibility for their children&rsquo;s upbringing. I am conscious that people  feel that sometimes bonding has not been completed by age five, and that it may  take a little longer, perhaps until age seven. Every child and every household  is different. I fully appreciate and understand that, although I am not in  those particular circumstances myself.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is a necessary Bill. However, I am very anxious to hear  the Committee&rsquo;s views on operational flexibility. I am particularly conscious  that the money for these measures and for benefits in general does not come  from the Northern Ireland  block grant, but from annually managed expenditure that brings a significant  amount of money into the Northern    Ireland economy on a year-on-year basis.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill is a parity measure and an important step in the  ongoing process of welfare reform. Notwithstanding my own reservations, the  Bill encourages people to work while supporting those who cannot.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Social Development (Mr Hamilton)</strong>: The Committee for  Social Development devoted substantial energy and time to considering the  principles underpinning the Welfare Reform Bill. The Committee reviewed the  Green Paper of the equivalent Westminster Bill and responded to that  consultation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee also responded to the Department for Social  Development&rsquo;s equality impact assessment consultation on the Northern Ireland  version of the Welfare Reform Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Before I refer to the key components of the Bill, I will  make some remarks that set out the Committee&rsquo;s general view. I stress that my  comments will be an attempt to give the broad range of views that were  expressed by the Committee during its deliberations.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The majority of Committee members support the principle of  maintaining parity with the rest of the United Kingdom in respect of social  security, child maintenance and pensions matters. Most members generally feel  that Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  position within the UK  welfare state is beneficial for those claiming benefits and other claimants.  Thus, the majority of members welcome the Bill in so far as it maintains access  to existing welfare provision within Northern Ireland and introduces  necessary and beneficial reforms.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Given what I just said about the maintenance of parity, I  must record the Committee&rsquo;s well-expressed dismay at the Department&rsquo;s delay to  the introduction of the Welfare Reform Bill. That has led to an administrative  disparity between Northern Ireland  and the rest of the United    Kingdom in respect of certain social  security matters. It is understood that to avoid any possible detriment to  claimants in Northern Ireland,  Royal Assent for the Bill must be secured before October 2010. To facilitate  that, the Committee has agreed that following referral of the Bill, the  Committee Stage will be undertaken as expeditiously as possible.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I strongly believe that scrutiny at the Committee Stage and  amendment, where necessary, at the Bill&rsquo;s subsequent stages are of critical  importance to the legislative process. With that in mind, the Committee will  endeavour to complete its work thoroughly and in a timely manner so as to ensure  an appropriate level of review, while minimising the consequences of the  Department&rsquo;s pre-introduction delay.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will now make a few remarks on the various clauses of the  Bill. As the Minister indicated, the Welfare Reform Bill continues the process  of change to social security provision. Many aspects of the Bill are intended  to be helpful, such as encouraging the long-term unemployed or those with  caring responsibilities to regain the skills and habits associated with  employment. The Committee recognises that paid work is a good thing. As I have  said in the House before, regular, safe and appropriately rewarded employment  brings economic, social and even health benefits to those in employment and,  crucially, to their families.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee agrees that no one should be left behind by  the welfare state and it welcomes the principle of inclusion for all sections  of our community in the benefits of regular and rewarded employment. Although  the majority of Committee members do not dispute that principle, some members  may have difficulties with the outworkings of the measures proposed in the  Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill proposes a work for your benefit scheme, as the  Minister outlined. The principle of providing encouragement and intensive  support for the longer-term unemployed to help them overcome barriers to  employment is welcome. However, the proposed practice of compelling the  unemployed to undertake work for no additional remuneration may prove more  controversial.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Committee members understand the Department&rsquo;s assurance  that such a scheme would only be introduced to Northern Ireland following the  evaluation of pilot schemes in Great Britain and a decision in Westminster to  proceed with a national roll-out of the scheme. Nonetheless, members of the  Committee are understandably concerned that the Bill requires the Assembly to  sign up to a scheme that could be viewed as being unfair to claimants and could  also undermine the existing employment market. Committee members will want to  explore, as far as time permits, the manner in which that provision can be  fairly implemented while maintaining parity with the rest of the UK in social  security provision.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill also proposes the complete phased migration of  income support claimants to employment and support allowance (ESA) and  jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance (JSA). The House has taken a great interest in the  implementation of ESA, and members of the Social Development Committee recently  visited the ESA processing centre in James House. The record of ESA claimant  processing, although greatly improved in recent times, was extremely poor when  the new benefit was launched. Although the full migration of income support claimants  to ESA and JSA will be phased in, members are keen that there is no repetition  of the lengthy processing times, confusion and unnecessary concerns for  claimants that characterised the initial transfers to ESA.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Welfare Reform Bill contains provisions that will  require certain lone parents to undertake work-related activity and to produce  employment action plans as a condition of the continued receipt of benefits.  The Committee notes that the Bill also contains provisions that require the  well-being of claimants&rsquo; children to be considered in the development of  employment action plans.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Since the Committee first considered the proposals for the  Bill in October 2008 and at every juncture thereafter, members have  consistently highlighted concerns about claimants who have children. Members  contend that the proposed measures may be workable in Great Britain where so-called wrap-around  childcare is available; however, in Northern Ireland, there is  considerably less provision for childcare and, as yet, no overarching strategy  to address the situation. As a consequence, some Committee members have  signalled that the additional measures for lone parents may require amendment  or, possibly, further Assembly procedures to ensure that their implementation  does not disadvantage lone parents in Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill introduces benefit sanctions for fraudsters,  claimants who have been convicted or cautioned for violence against benefits  staff and for claimants who fail to attend certain mandatory interviews. Everyone  will agree that benefit fraud must be countered, and everyone will also agree  that all sensible measures should be taken to protect benefits staff from  violence or from the threat of violence. The proposed sanctions in that area  are understandable and have, generally, been welcomed by the Committee.  However, the sanctions for failing to attend mandatory interviews are a cause  of concern for some members of the Committee. It is anticipated that some time  will be needed to review the proposed outworking of those sanctions and their  impact, particularly on the children of claimants.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Welfare Reform Bill includes measures that, although  unwelcome, most members accept as inevitable, including the abolition of adult  dependency increases for certain allowances and the requirement for new  claimants of contributory ESA and JSA to have more National Insurance  contributions. Most members accept that changes to those provisions would be  expensive and, therefore, outside the legislative competence of the Assembly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Some aspects of the Bill are very welcome. For example, in  the view of most Committee members, the extension of certain disability living  allowance (DLA) payments to the visually impaired, the introduction of payments  on account for benefits claimants and the introduction of exemptions from  job-seeking conditions for the victims of domestic violence reflect the  advantages of parity with the rest of the United Kingdom on social security  matters.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Subject to the approval of the House, the Committee for  Social Development will review the Bill with its usual rigour and energy.  Certain aspects of the Bill that relate, for example, to the contracting out of  services provided by the Department for Employment and Learning will be  referred to that Department&rsquo;s Committee for scrutiny. Subject to the  co-operation of the Department for Social Development, the Committee intends to  conclude its scrutiny as quickly as possible. I assure the House that the  Committee will ensure, as far as possible, that there will be no detriment for  benefits claimants in Northern    Ireland as a consequence of the Department&rsquo;s  delay in introducing the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Before I conclude, I want to make some remarks as a  Democratic Unionist Assembly Member. My party has consistently supported  helping people who can work to return to work; everyone in the House subscribes  to that idea. We are all aware of the very high levels of economic inactivity  in Northern Ireland  and of the fact that many people included in those statistics want to work, are  capable of working and simply need support and encouragement to do so.  Furthermore, we are mindful that although the Minister&rsquo;s Department and other  Departments can make many interventions, the best way for an individual or a  family to get out of poverty is through a good, well-paid job. That is the best  antidote to poverty. We all subscribe to the idea of encouraging people who can  work and who want to work to get back into the labour market. That is why I am  very pleased with the reforms in the Bill and with the support that is  proposed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The support is not only about interviews; it is, in many  respects, a hand-holding exercise, because some people who have been out of  work for a very long period have forgotten what it is like to apply for a job.  They do not know about that process at all. We need to help people not only to  build the skills that they might use in work, but the skills that they need to  apply for a job or for several jobs.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">So, it is as much about building CVs and  interviewing skills as about training and simply having support. I welcome that  focus of the Bill. We will see how that operates as the Committee rescrutinises  the Bill.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.30 am</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to talk about the breach of parity. Some Members  perhaps do not agree with parity, and the Minister, in her successful bid for  her party&rsquo;s leadership, talked about moving away from having Northern Ireland encompassed within the UK social  security umbrella. However, I have always believed in maintaining parity with  the rest of the United    Kingdom, because it provides a safety net  for our citizens. We have all worked with the system day in and day out in our  constituency work, and some Members have done so professionally in the advice  sector. No one would say for a second that the system is perfect. As the  Minister herself said, however, it is at times such as this, in the middle of  very difficult economic circumstances, when the benefits that our welfare state  provides for our citizens are seen, and that comfort blanket is there for  people so that they do not fall through the cracks, or, if they do, they can  still be caught with other protections. We should all subscribe to that.  Therefore, my party and I take very seriously any breach of parity, whether for  one day or one month &mdash; indeed, any break of any magnitude &mdash; because of the fear  that has been instilled in us down the years and certainly over the past three  years. I cannot recall how many times, during my membership of the House, I  have heard the Minister or officials tell us of the catastrophic consequences  that a breach of parity could cause. We were told that the roof would fall in  if there was a breach of parity, yet here, because of the delay caused by the  Department, there has been a breach of parity.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I accept the Minister&rsquo;s explanation that the breach may well  be only technical. &ldquo;Technical&rdquo; is one of those euphemistic words that covers a  multitude of sins. It appears that a lot of these initiatives and measures kick  in somewhat down the line, and we have until October to get the legislation in  place. However, I ask the Minister to explain more clearly the consequences of  the breach in parity. No Chairperson or member of a Committee would not welcome  the opportunity to scrutinise at length and in detail every piece of  legislation. However, as the Minister herself acknowledged, every other piece  of social security legislation presented to the House in the past three years  has gone through by accelerated passage and, therefore, has not been amended by  Members.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although I accept and welcome the Minister&rsquo;s points about  operational flexibility, that is the very narrow remit with which we are  dealing: it is operational matters, nothing to do with the detail of the  legislation and certainly nothing to do with payment levels or new or  non-payments. The House and Committee are dealing with a matter of very limited  territory. I have to ask, therefore: why the delay; why the breach in parity;  and what are the consequences of the breach?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Even though there has been a breach in parity and even  though that old fox that we must have parity at all times has been shot, I  still hear the Minister talk about the need to maintain parity. Although my  party and I certainly agree with keeping parity, we are concerned that there  has been a breach, albeit of a technical nature. Nonetheless, there has been a  breach, and I ask the Minister to outline better for the House what the  consequences of that may be and, if there was any delay, what the consequences  would be after October.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">With those remarks as a DUP Member over and subject to the  reservations that I have set out as Committee Chairperson and personally, the  majority of the Social Development Committee generally welcomes the principles  of the Bill. I look forward to the Bill&rsquo;s various stages and the opportunity to  scrutinise it in detail and at length but in a timely manner.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I apologise for missing the beginning  of the Minister&rsquo;s contribution: I was at a Committee meeting.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It must be realised that the Welfare Reform Bill heralds  one of the major changes in benefits since the inception of the welfare state  and needs to be scrutinised in detail because of the implications that it will  have for those who are reliant on the benefits system. By saying that people  must come first, the Minister expressed a noble sentiment about the Welfare  Reform Bill. We shall wait and see the eventual outcome of the Bill as it  starts to affect people, because work-for-benefits schemes have been mooted in  the past, particularly in models based on welfare-to-work programmes in America.  However, in the past, such schemes were initially felt to be too prescriptive  on claimants and people in the benefits system.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I apologise for repeating some of the issues that have  already been covered by the Committee Chairperson and the Minister, but I will  start with the issue of lone parents with young children having to be available  for work. The lack of a childcare strategy has already been mentioned. The  introduction of such a strategy and the proper provision of childcare should  not be done in isolation; it should be an interdepartmental initiative.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am impressed by the Minister&rsquo;s knowledge of child  psychology and the age at which children cease to bond with their parents.  Seven seems to be the cut-off point. In future, the Bill may reduce that  cut-off age to one. What will happen then to the bonding process in children  between the ages of one and seven? I am sure that the Minister will give us  some idea of that in her summation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill also makes provision to reform the social fund. It  will provide that, at the discretion of an appropriate officer, a payment may  instead be made to a third party to provide goods or services. That idea was  tried in the 1980s before the social fund was introduced as a replacement for  single payments. In my work area at that time, it sometimes led to a monopoly  developing with certain providers, and, in some cases, the stigmatisation of  social security claimants. Shops actually put up signs stating &ldquo;DHSS claimants  accepted&rdquo;. However, people were reluctant to use those shops because, by doing  so, they immediately felt stigmatised in the sense that they were receiving  what they might have considered handouts. Some providers of goods specifically  touted for social security claimants. In fact, when the social fund was  introduced, some retailers in my area went out of business because the social  fund was not on a par with the old single payments system.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill provides for benefits sanctions for jobseeker&rsquo;s  allowance claimants who, without good cause, fail to attend mandatory  appointments in connection with their claim. The Committee heard evidence from  the National Autistic Society, and I think that adults with autism and people  with mental health problems must be handled sensitively. The Minister for  Employment and Learning&rsquo;s expressed interest in providing proper training via,  for instance, Disability Action, is to be commended. There will also be  sanctions against claimants who act violently or threateningly to staff. That  can be very traumatic for staff, but the backgrounds of the perpetrators, who  may well have mental health problems, needs to be established.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill mentions lifetime opportunities. Policies are  designed, apparently, to improve employment outcomes for disadvantaged groups,  such as lone parents and disabled people. It also mentions increased  employment, improving individuals&rsquo; welfare and fostering social inclusion. Work  remains the best and most sustainable route out of poverty; it is also good for  people&rsquo;s health and well-being. Apart from sounding patronising and  aspirational, the Bill provides no evidence that the work mentioned should be  suitable, financially beneficial or provide stimulus and satisfaction for the  person involved.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Welfare Reform Bill mentions removing benefit  complexity, which can be only good. The employment and support allowance (ESA)  centre that I visited with the Committee was very impressive. The process of  taking claims was very good; getting payments out seemed to be the main  problem.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The ultimate aim is to have one universal benefit. That  will surely lead to more centralisation, the diminution of front line services  and, inevitably, job losses in the Social Security Agency. I am sure that the  Minister will address those matters in her summation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Removing income support may well mean that people will have  to satisfy more stringent requirements for benefit. If people are to be  encouraged back to work, there is an urgent need for a complete overhaul of the  tax credit system. For a large number of people, that has proven a complete  shambles, with large overpayments being made and challenged, and tax credit  offices being virtually uncontactable.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Welfare Reform Bill is something of a curate&rsquo;s egg: it  is good in parts. In its present form, it will be difficult and complex to  administer. There are many areas in which parity may simply not be applicable,  even though it will be enforced. I am reluctant to say that I have seen it all  before, but provisions in the Bill have been considered and tried in the past  and were found seriously wanting. As someone once said, it is like d&eacute;j&agrave; vu all  over again.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Armstrong</strong>:  I welcome the Bill, which is an opportunity to tackle welfare reform and  unemployment in Northern    Ireland. However, I am concerned that the  reforms do not go far enough. We can be more imaginative in how we effectively  address welfare reform. Perhaps the Minister will assure the House that the  traditional approach with regard to parity has been taken in respect of the  Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill includes a number of clauses to be considered in  the months ahead. It is part of the ongoing process of welfare reform and  modernisation of the benefits system in Northern Ireland. The Bill consists  of three Parts: Social Security; Child Maintenance; and Miscellaneous and  Supplementary. The first Part relates to social security and addresses the  abolition of income support, supporting parents with young children into  employment, community care grants and benefit fraud. The second Part addresses  child maintenance and provides for amendments to the current statutory  provisions that relate to information offences. The final Part addresses  repeals and revocations of other legislation and the like.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is likely that the Bill will lift more families out of  poverty and potentially assist more people into work in Northern Ireland.  The Bill proposes to reform the welfare and benefits system to improve support  and initiatives for people to move from benefits into work. In recent months,  we have seen redundancies in many businesses and manufacturing industries  throughout Northern Ireland.  They are happening in ones, twos, tens, and we have even seen hundreds of jobs  going in individual companies across Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Unemployment and redundancy are about much more than  statistics. Each of us knows people, constituents, friends and family members  who have lost their job and the income for their whole family. Some are  struggling to get their first job. Young people are trying to enter the labour  market for the first time. Mothers and fathers are struggling to feed and  clothe their children, as well as make their rent or mortgage payments.  Unemployment is rising faster than at any time in the past 18 years. Youth  employment has been particularly badly hit.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Tackling unemployment and the dependency on the benefits  system remains central to ensuring that people meet their potential in the  workforce and to engendering the positive contribution of individuals to our  society. We all know that work is key to physical and mental well-being. It  also has a generational impact on the well-being of our children. I look  forward to discussion of the Bill in Committee.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  I welcome the Bill. Many points have been raised by various members of the  Committee. I am sure that the Minister will address those. I want to know about  the flexibility that the Bill allows for. The Minister said that she has  considered that matter with the relevant GB Minister and that we will be  allowed a bit of flexibility. There is a big difference between Northern Ireland and Britain; look at the habits here  and the habits there. We need flexibility. I hope that that happens for the  Bill, and I hope that the Minister will be allowed to use her flexibility. I  welcome the Bill, I thank the Minister for bringing it to the House, and I look  forward to its coming to the Committee.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.45 am</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: I  support the principles of the Bill, but I have concerns that many of the  sanctions seem to be very draconian. At the beginning of the debate, the  Chairperson comprehensively set out the reservations of Committee members. As  the Minister said, we need to look at evaluations of the various pilots in England to see whether those sanctions and steps  and measures are workable for Northern    Ireland. It is not that people do not want  to work, but many people here have limited or no qualifications to gain  employment. Sometimes they are offered jobs that do not pay them enough, and  they are much better off on benefits, so they stay on benefits. Therefore, it  is important to give people practical help and support to try to upskill them  to make them employable. It is not just the responsibility of the Department  for Social Development. There must be joint working with the Department of  Education and the Department for Employment and Learning to help people to get  the necessary qualifications so that they can work.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As other Members have said, work provides people with  self-esteem and better mental health. There is a lot of apprehension in the  community about the various steps in the Bill, and lone parents in particular  are concerned. Mickey Brady was right to point out to the Minister that the  Bill aims to bring lone parents back to work when their children are one year  old. I have two children and a stepson, and I know that I would not have wanted  to be forced to leave a one-year-old baby in the house while I went out to  work, particularly when many neighbourhoods in Northern Ireland do not have  affordable and accessible childcare. We have seen a decline in the number of  childminders, which is forcing people to leave their little ones at home with a  childminder who may not be appropriate. That is a great concern for me and for  the community and society.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Some sanctions, such as child maintenance, sound quite  incredible to me. With my background in community work and social work, I have  always had a strong view that non-resident parents should pay maintenance so  that their children will not be deprived. However, following successful  piloting in Great Britain, the Bill will allow the administrative  disqualification of non-resident parents from holding or obtaining a driving  licence. That will make people lose their job, and that will not help anybody,  least of all the child. We will need to look carefully at the outcomes of the various  pilots in England. The Bill will also create an offence relating to failure to  disclose a change of circumstances by a non-resident parent. I agree with that,  but it seems very negative to take away a person&rsquo;s driving licence.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I ask the Minister to be careful. I welcome her decision to  breach parity, although I share the Committee Chairperson&rsquo;s concerns. I welcome  also the period that the Committee has for more detailed scrutiny of the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>: I  generally welcome the reforms laid out in the Welfare Reform Bill, but I have  some issues, which I will outline towards the end of my speech.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the &ldquo;work for your benefit&rdquo; scheme. It is not  about people being forced to earn their benefits, but about providing them with  the experience that will help them to get a job. Many people who are on  jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and other work-related benefits have been on them for  some time, and the longer they have been out of work, the greater an obstacle  it becomes for them when filling in a job application form. The scheme will,  therefore, be beneficial to those on unemployment-related benefits in that it  will help them to gain practical work experience, and I look forward to the  results of the pilot scheme on the mainland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The extension of certain DLA payments to the visually  impaired has to be welcomed, as many people have been disenfranchised under the  current system. I welcome also the change in how the payment of community care  grants will be made. They will go directly to the suppliers of goods and services.  That will ease the burden on those in need and, hopefully, make the delivery of  services smoother. I welcome the introduction of payments on account for  benefit claimants, as well as the introduction of sanctions against benefit  fraudsters, including those who have been convicted or cautioned for violence  against benefit staff and claimants who fail to attend mandatory interviews. We  must stamp out fraud where we can.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the introduction of exemptions from job-seeking  conditions for victims of domestic violence. That is an acceptance of the  genuine reasons why some people may not be able to get into a job. I welcome  also the consideration of a child&rsquo;s well-being when looking at parents&rsquo;  benefits.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I do, however, have some concerns and queries about a  number of issues in the Bill relating to the migration of income support  claimants to jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and employment and support allowance. I am  concerned about the impact that that may have on lone parents, many of whom  receive income support while raising and caring for their family. Lone parents  have the right to spend time with their children in the absence of the second  parent, so what does the Minister propose to do to protect them?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am also concerned about the requirement for certain lone  parents and partners of benefit recipients to undertake action planning and  work-related activity as a condition for the continued receipt of benefits.  Lone parents should have the support of the state, when they feel it is  necessary, in raising their children. I would like clarification of the  requirements for certain employment and support allowance claimants to  undertake work-related activities. Who does that relate to? Furthermore, what  social security matters within the Department for Employment and Learning does  the Minister intend to contract out? From my experience, I know that  contracting out causes problems, including delays and poor communication. Those  receiving benefits, therefore, experience undue stress and hassle when seeking  those benefits. I would also like to query the introduction of work focus  interviews for claimants who are aged between 60 and 65. Why is that group  receiving special attention?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Overall, reform in our social security system is needed,  but at its centre are the claimants who, for whatever reason, are receiving  state support. The system was created to support people, not to cause a  hindrance or distress. It is, therefore, important that we get these things  right, because, after one set of reforms comes through, we will need to change  them, according to the experience of those who are in receipt of benefits. I  will continue to monitor the Bill, and some changes may well have to be made at  a later stage.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle, Minister agus a chairde. A lot has  been said about welfare reform already, and I know that the Bill will go to the  Committee for scrutiny. I will raise several points about what I believe the  impact of the changes will be on our communities in the coming period.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Since the Bill&rsquo;s introduction, Sinn F&eacute;in has raised many  concerns about the impact that it will have on those who, because of ill health  or lack of employment, find themselves claiming benefits. In the past, my  colleague Mickey Brady said that he fears that we are heading towards a  universal benefit, which will make it more difficult for people to access  benefits. Benefits should not be about stopping people claiming their  entitlements but about ensuring that those who need help can avail themselves  of it without their motives for making a claim being questioned. It is amazing  that, every time there is a change to the benefit system, we are informed that  such changes are aimed at making it easier for people to make claims, when in  fact the opposite is often the case. Many people believe that such changes are  more about forcing people to come off certain benefits than about ensuring that  they can access the benefit system.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Close to 110, 000 people across the North are in receipt of  incapacity benefit. Many people in the voluntary and community sector believe  that the decisions to change the name of that benefit to employment and support  allowance and to introduce work-related interviews will lead to a serious  reduction in the number of claimants. In fact, it has been said that targets  already exist to halve the number of people who claim incapacity benefit. That  would result in a reduction of some 50,000 claimants. What is laughable about  those changes is the push to get people back to work when what is not explained  is where the jobs are to be found.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have argued about conducting job-related interviews and  how people with mental health problems, those who suffer from autism or those  with other serious problems are being treated. There is a particular concern  about people with learning or educational difficulties. It is all right to say  that staff have been trained to deal with all eventualities, but, from the  feedback that we are getting from departmental staff and the many support  organisations that represent those who suffer from various difficulties, that  does not seem to be the case. There can be serious consequences not only for  claimants but for staff who are forced into the position of having to deal with  someone who has serious problems. Such members of staff may be unable to  recognise that the claimant is having difficulties. I appeal to those groups  and individuals to take part in the Committee Stage of the legislative process.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Several weeks ago, the Committee for Social Development  visited the headquarters of the processing of claims for employment and support  allowance. I have to say that we were impressed by the commitment of the staff  and management at that processing centre. However, problems still remain. In  the past week, from my office, I phoned a number that was provided to elected  representatives, but it took up to 25 minutes to get through. However, when I  eventually did get through, the staff dealt with the query effectively.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My colleague Mickey Brady covered other issues, including  effective training for staff and how the changes will impact on lone parents,  especially given the lack of effective childcare provision.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We also have serious concerns about the use of sanctions,  such as the removal of benefits for the most trivial reasons. Many people have  been left without payments for many weeks with no other means of survival.  Changes to the social fund will make it more difficult for people to access  benefits and, in particular, interest-free loans, which many people rely on to  clothe their family at various times of the year. The change will have serious  consequences and will force people into the waiting arms of unscrupulous  moneylenders who charge huge interest rates. Therefore, the changes will impact  on people&rsquo;s ability to survive and provide.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although we are tied to parity, I would be in no rush to  implement some elements of the legislation. We have the ability to administer  the benefit system so that it helps rather than hinders people. We should  remember that circumstances are not the same here as in England. We live in a  low-pay society in which many essentials are more expensive. As I said, where  are the jobs to ensure that people go from benefits to employment? Let us not  fool ourselves: the implementation of certain provisions in the Welfare Reform  Bill could have detrimental consequences for many of our citizens.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Alex Easton spoke about sanctions. I understand and  appreciate what the Minister said about anyone who issues any type of threat  against staff or resorts to violence being subject to sanctions. However, many  people who, for whatever reason, forgot to turn up for an interview have had  their benefits suspended for anything from one week to eight weeks. During that  period, they have to rely on family or friends to survive.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">If people are forced down that road, the system  must be wrong. We continually talk about the impact that crime has on our  society, yet we are forcing people into positions in which they are being  sanctioned. They may have nobody to turn to when it comes to feeding and  clothing themselves or when it comes to socialising. That needs to be taken  into consideration when we are looking at how sanctions are being administered  across the board.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">12.00 noon</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank the Chairperson of the Committee for Social  Development, Simon Hamilton, and all the Members who spoke. I listened to  Members&rsquo; points carefully, and I trust that I will be able to address any  concerns that they might have. If I do not fully answer the issues that they  have raised, I will write to them after a full examination of the Hansard  report.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Hamilton asked about the consequences of the delay to  date for individuals in Northern Ireland. That brings us back to the technical issue,  and principle, of parity. I assure the Member that the delay to date has no  consequences for individuals in Northern Ireland. The main impact is that adult  dependency increases here will not be abolished from April 2010.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Chairperson also mentioned the work for your benefit  programme, which is designed to provide the long-term unemployed with work  experience and training to enable them to be in a better position to find work.  We should always exhort and encourage people, and I would like all officials to  be in that frame of mind so that they can be particularly sympathetic to all  claimants&rsquo; needs while encouraging them to find work. I take on board the fact  that that is difficult during an economic recession. Nevertheless, every effort  should be made to help people.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The exact form of the work for your benefit programme will  become clear after the pilot schemes in Britain have been evaluated. Members  should remember that I said, during the Second Reading of the Bill, that I had  certain reservations and concerns. In July 2009, I put those reservations to  Minister of State at the Department for Work and Pensions Jim Knight.  Consequently, I was allowed to bring about operational flexibility, which makes  Northern Ireland that bit different and reflects its special circumstances.  Other issues in relation to the work for your benefit programme will be  considered in conjunction with the Department for Employment and Learning.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Hamilton also mentioned income support, which will be  abolished only when arrangements have been made to transfer claimants to other  suitable benefits. There is no timescale for that. Carers will not be moved  until suitable arrangements for them have been put in place.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Chairperson and Mr Brady mentioned lone parents. I am  very well aware that childcare is an issue in Northern Ireland, particularly in  rural communities, where the same access to childcare is not available.  Childcare is a matter for other Ministers around the Executive table, so I hope  that Members will encourage their colleagues to do everything possible to  ensure that adequate provision is put in place, particularly with respect to  early-years partnerships. That is why, given the difficulties with that matter,  I got the approval of the Minister of State at the Department for Work and  Pensions to introduce extra flexibility.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I will come back to Mr Brady in a minute.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It will be at least two years before the changes set out in  the Bill are introduced here. Therefore, there should be time to look at all of  this and make a start on dealing with the childcare issue. In any event, no  lone parent will be sanctioned &mdash; I do not like sanctions &mdash; if suitable and  affordable childcare is not readily available. In fact, I also gave that  assurance with respect to other social security legislation. I am particularly  concerned about the level of childcare, but it is within the remit of other  Ministers.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: I  thank the Minister for giving way. During my previous employment, about seven  years ago, academics carried out a survey of social services in the Mournes  area, which is part of the Minister&rsquo;s constituency, showing that the area had  the worst childcare provision in western Europe, with some five registered childminders.  That must be addressed urgently. I said in my speech that it is an  interdepartmental issue.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I hear what Mr Brady says. It would be useful if the  appropriate Minister brought forward the policy that the early-years  partnership has sought for a considerable time in that area. That would address  the issue. I am aware of childcare provision in south Down; in fact, preschool  and nursery provision is offered by groups throughout the constituency.  Therefore, I want to correct that point. There is a need for the early-years  partnership policy, which was promised some three years ago, to be published.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: No. I will not take any more interventions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Brady mentioned the social fund. Detailed arrangements  are still under consideration. The objective will always be to get the best  value for the money that is spent and to provide the best possible service to  claimants. The central issues are service, assistance and help. I want to put  that on record.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Simon Hamilton and Mickey Brady mentioned sanctions, which  I raised with the Minister of State because of my concern about the matter. I  was assured that sanctions will be used only as a last resort.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Brady raised the issue of working tax credits in the  context of the Bill. I am rather surprised that he does not know that that is a  taxation matter and is, therefore, for the Inland Revenue and the Chancellor of  the Exchequer. It does not belong in the Bill. I return to the fundamental  political point that one must be in Westminster, where fundamental decisions  about social security and taxation are taken.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>:  Change party then.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: No. That is a simple fact. Members who choose to ignore  it should take a lesson on the matter.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Brady also said that universal benefit leads to  centralisation and referred to the reduction of staff in Social Security Agency  branches. I suppose that the Welfare Reform Bill is part of a move towards  simplifying the benefits system. We are moving towards a benefit for people who  can work and another for those who are prevented from working by illness or  disability. I am anxious that we provide every assistance, empathy and sympathy  to those who encounter difficult circumstances. I have told officials  emphatically that they must be, and I believe that they are, sympathetic to  people&rsquo;s circumstances.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I assure Members that there is no intention to reduce the  number of staff in Social Security Agency offices as a result of the Bill.  However, we are in a difficult financial climate. I am conscious, as, I am  sure, is Mr Brady, that staff work under particularly difficult circumstances  because of higher live load: a higher number of people are claiming. Members  are aware of that because people who are in difficult circumstances come into  our constituency offices: people encountering poverty who have never been in  that situation before. I have told my officials that they must be particularly  helpful, sympathetic and empathetic to those people&rsquo;s needs.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Billy Armstrong and Anna Lo raised the issue of driving  licences. That proposal was dropped. In fact, in July 2009, I told Mr Knight,  who is the appropriate Minister in Britain, that I would not go ahead with it  and that I wanted flexibility to ensure that it was dropped, which it was.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Lack of qualifications is a matter for the Minister for  Employment and Learning. I will ensure that any issues that relate to  employment and skills, which are his responsibility, are referred to him. I  will ask him to respond to Members appropriately.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McCann raised the issue of whether the staff would be  trained to deal sympathetically with customers at all times. The answer is yes.  I would like to think that all our staff deal with people sympathetically,  because that is the very least that we expect when we deal with people. We want  to deal with people on a human, sympathetic basis. I have instructed staff that  they must take on board the needs of those who may be meeting difficult  financial circumstances for the first time, and others who have ongoing  financial difficulties. We must be particularly sympathetic, because we meet  such people regularly in our constituency offices, on the streets and, perhaps,  in our own families.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are those who say that benefit claimants have  responsibilities, as well as rights. However, it has always been my contention  that many who have problems with their benefits are in dire straits. We have to  take that into account and be particularly sympathetic, and I have instructed  staff to do so. People do not decide to apply for benefits lightly; they do so  because they are in financial distress.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Alex Easton raised the issue about the power to direct  claimants to undertake specific work-related activity. I assure the Member that  personal advisers will always encourage, persuade and support people to take up  work-related activity, which is considered necessary, before considering  requiring someone to undertake a particular activity. If someone consistently  fails to engage effectively with the personalised support arrangements, two  situations are envisaged whereby an adviser may be able to require someone to  undertake a specific activity. For example, where there is a significant barrier  to work that the claimant has been encouraged to address, but has failed to do  so, discretion will be used as to whether the claimant is directed into the  specific work-related activity straight away or allowed the period between  work-focused interviews to comply voluntarily with the suggestion before a  formal direction is given. Additionally, action may be required when a claimant  may have failed to meet his or her general work-related activity requirement  without due cause.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I would like to think that we can be as sympathetic as  possible. I am conscious of the fact that we are in difficult financial  circumstances, that we are in an economic recession, and that the number of  jobs available in certain areas is not what is used to be. However, I would like  to think that all of us in the Chamber will provide every opportunity for  everybody, through our words and through our actions, and that we will use  every opportunity to ensure that people are dealt with sympathetically and that  every form of skill and training will be available to those who want it and who  want to be encouraged.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I am nearly finished, so I want to continue and to  conclude. I hope that I have addressed all the points that have been raised. I  will read Hansard carefully and if any Member has raised an issue that I have  failed to address or that needs to be dealt with in more detail, I will write  to that Member. Suffice to say that I, too, have reservations, which I raised  with the appropriate Minister in GB last year. I look forward to the work of  the Committee. I have given it the opportunity to scrutinise the Bill line by  line, and I want Committee members to come back to me with the particular  issues that they have raised. I want to ensure that every possible aspect will  be dealt with. I urge Members across the Chamber to ensure that their  ministerial colleagues who have responsibility for childcare fulfil their  obligations in every possible way, rather than take out little daggers at DSD.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That the Second Stage of the Welfare Reform Bill  [13/09] be agreed.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod" style="page-break-before:always;">12.15 pm</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading"><a name="4"></a>Revised Programme of Expenditure 2010-11</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to two hours for  this debate. The Minister will have up to 10 minutes to propose the motion and  20 minutes to make a winding up speech. All other Members who wish to speak  will have five minutes.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel (Mr S Wilson)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly approves the revised programme of  expenditure proposals for 2010-11 as set out in the Budget laid before the  Assembly on 13 April 2010.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Last Tuesday, I presented the Executive&rsquo;s revised Budget  proposals for the financial year 2010-11, following the period of consultation  on the draft proposals from the review of the 2010-11 spending plans. Today, on  behalf of the Executive, I am seeking the Assembly&rsquo;s approval for those plans.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The supporting document that I published last week provides  details of the consultation process and the Executive&rsquo;s response to it. As only  a limited amount of time has been set aside for the debate, I will not go over  all the issues or the individual allocations to Departments. However, I want to  emphasise a few key points on the Executive&rsquo;s revised plans for Members to  consider in advance of the vote on the motion.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The 2010-11 Budget allocations for Northern Ireland  Departments were first determined as part of the Budget process in 2007. The  plans were based on the phased introduction of water charges for domestic  consumers, a freeze in the domestic regional rates and a delivery of  significant capital receipts by Departments. However, since those plans were  agreed by the Executive and approved by the Assembly in January 2008, the  economic landscape has changed substantially. Some will suggest that those  changes could have been predicted, but it is worth noting how unreliable some  of the economic forecasts made at that time have turned out to be. For example,  in 2007 Treasury projections were for the UK economy to grow by 2&middot;7% in  2009-2010, yet, in reality, it shrunk by 3&middot;7%. In addition, UK unemployment was  projected to remain at under the one million mark in 2010, yet the actual  figure is some 700,000 higher.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Since the Executive proposals were approved in 2008, a  number of spending pressures have emerged, including the Civil Service equal  pay claim, which amounted to &pound;160 million, and the Northern Ireland share of  the &pound;5 billion additional public expenditure savings expected of UK Departments  this year, which amounts to &pound;122&middot;8 million. In addition, the improved spending  performance of local Departments since the restoration of devolution has meant  that it was prudent for the Executive to revise their planning estimates of the  starting level of overcommitment. However, the most significant cost pressure  facing the Executive in 2010-11 relates to the deferral of the introduction of  domestic water charges, which will cost &pound;200 million.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As a consequence of those and other changes, the Executive  were faced with a net spending pressure of &pound;217&middot;1 million in current  expenditure and &pound;149&middot;9 million in capital investment spending. In response, the  Executive&rsquo;s draft proposals, which I launched for consultation on 12 January  2010, involve a reprioritisation of existing Budget allocations to Departments  to deliver additional savings this year. In recognition of the potential impact  on front line services, the Executive agreed a targeted approach with the  lowest rate of current expenditure savings to be made by the Health Department,  due to the importance of health and social care services.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, a lower than average rate of savings is  required from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (DETI) and the  Department for Employment and Learning (DEL). That reflects the priority  afforded in the Programme for Government to growing the economy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although I have sought to protect priority services at  Executive level, it is also important that individual Departments deliver  savings in a manner that has the least possible impact on the services that  they provide. One of the best ways to ensure that that happens is for the plans  to be subject to public scrutiny, which is why I asked ministerial colleagues  to publish their Departments&rsquo; detailed plans on websites to facilitate  consideration by the Assembly and the wider public.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The main form of consultation on the Executive&rsquo;s proposals  has been through the Assembly, although adverts were also placed in local  newspapers, inviting comments from the wider public. I am pleased at the level  of interest that the Assembly has expressed in the Executive&rsquo;s proposals, which  was shown in the take-note debate of 9 February 2010. The motion was tabled by  the Committee for Finance and Personnel, which played a key role in the  consultation process in co-ordinating the views of all of the Assembly&rsquo;s  Statutory Committees.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I had the pleasure of meeting the Committee on 11 February,  and I was most grateful for the receipt of the report from the Committee at the  start of March. The report raised a number of pertinent and relevant points on  the Executive&rsquo;s proposals. In particular, I am glad that the Committee has  recognised the scale of spending pressures facing the Executive and that it has  agreed in principle with the approach that had been taken in response. However,  the Committee expressed concern at the level of engagement by some Departments  on their detailed plans. That point was prominent in the take-note debate and  in Question Time since then.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I recognise fully the temptation for some Departments and  Ministers to adopt the safety-first principle in seeking to avoid criticism by  not presenting the full picture to the Assembly and to the wider public.  However, that is a short-sighted way of working. Policies can be improved only  if departmental proposals are transparent.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In addition to the Assembly&rsquo;s important contribution, 18  responses were received from public interest groups, including business  organisations, health and social care bodies, children&rsquo;s groups and  organisations representing the interests of women. Although a broad range of  issues were raised in the responses, including calls for the levels of savings  that are expected in some public services to be reduced, almost no reference  was made to the critical issue of how that would be funded.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The one aspect of the Executive&rsquo;s proposals that has been  most welcomed by the Assembly is the &pound;26 million of funding for the invest to save  fund. Departments have submitted 60 proposals for support from that fund at a  cost of just under &pound;90 million. The proposals were first subjected to an  assessment in the areas of value for money, deliverability and additionality,  and the remaining projects were then ranked in order of the level of projected  savings versus the upfront cost in 2010-11.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That resulted in the invest to save allocation, which is  set out in detail in the revised 2010-11 spending plans document. It includes  &pound;6&middot;5 million for redundancy costs associated with transition to a more  streamlined administrative structure in education and &pound;4&middot;8 million for a land  measurement improvement project in the Department of Agriculture and Rural  Development (DARD) to reduce the risk of CAP disallowance payments, which have  the potential to reach &pound;15 million each year. It includes &pound;3&middot;7 million for the  digital dictation project in the Department of Health, Social Services and  Public Safety (DHSSPS) to reduce the need for administrative support, &pound;1&middot;4 million  to fund additional redundancies as part of the restructuring of libraries and  &pound;1&middot;4 million to fund the refurbishment of Enterprise trains to increase fuel  efficiency.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Apart from invest to save allocations, there has not been a  significant change to the overall financial position since January. Most of the  revisions to the draft spending plans are due to technical changes and  transfers between Departments. That includes a residual amount of funding of  just over &pound;100 million for the deferral of water charges that previously had  been held centrally.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The other significant change is in respect of the &pound;12&middot;1  million of additional funding made available to the Executive as a result of  the Chancellor of the Exchequer&rsquo;s announcement during the UK Budget last month.  That additional funding is being held centrally, and it will provide enhanced  scope for the Executive to address pressures as part of the 2010-11 in-year  monitoring process.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Having agreed with the draft proposals on the level of  savings from each Department, the Executive sought to confirm whether that was  the correct approach through two separate exercises.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Bring your remarks to a close, please.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I will try to pick up on some of those points at the  end of the debate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, although the focus over the past several  months has been on the amount of additional savings that will be required of  Departments, the reality is that such issues are of little direct importance to  the people of Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Time.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: Their main concern is the delivery of services. That  requires us to look at not just the amount of money but how it is being spent.  That will be one of the jobs of the Committees in the coming year.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Finance and Personnel (Ms J McCann)</strong>: Go raibh maith  agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his opening remarks.  When launching the original proposals in January, the Minister asked the  Committee for Finance and Personnel to produce a co-ordinated report on the  revised 2010-11 spending plans on behalf of all the scrutiny Committees. The  Committee was asked to publish its report speedily, either before the end of  February or as soon as possible thereafter, in order to provide the Executive  with sufficient time to consider the Assembly&rsquo;s views in coming to an agreed  final set of spending plans for 2010-11 by the middle of March.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although there has been some slippage in that regard, I  welcome the fact that the revised proposals are now before the Assembly for  debate. In order to inform its work, the Committee sought the other Committees&rsquo;  views on the proposals for their respective Departments. It also led a  take-note debate on 9 February that gave all Members an opportunity to debate  the proposals and shape the Committee&rsquo;s report, which was subsequently agreed  on 3 March and issued to the Department of Finance and Personnel (DFP).</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee recognised the limited options available for  addressing the public expenditure pressures for 2010-11, and it endorsed in  principle the proposed targeted approach to savings. That said, during evidence  sessions with DFP officials and the Minister, the Committee sought to determine  the precise methodology that gave rise to the specific percentage savings for  individual Departments. Members noted a dearth of supporting information to  explain the rationale behind the targeted percentage savings for each  Department, and the Committee concluded that all available information should  have been included in the review consultation document.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A particular criticism which was evident from the responses  received from the Committees, and which was repeatedly raised during the  take-note debate, regarded the lack of detailed information available on the  plans for the majority of Departments. Seven out of 11 Committees expressed  varying levels of dissatisfaction with the shortcomings in the information that  their Departments provided. The Committee considered that the lack of detailed  information prevented substantive input from the Assembly and the wider public,  and it is strongly critical of those Departments that failed to engage properly  with their Committees.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Since it published its report on the Executive&rsquo;s draft  Budget 2008-2011 in December 2007, the Committee has repeatedly called for the  establishment of a formal Budget process. The Committee considers that that  would enable the Committees to plan the necessary scrutiny of future Executive  Budgets and expenditure, and that it would focus Departments&rsquo; attention on the  need to meet their Committees&rsquo; requirements. It might also prevent a repeat of  the difficulties encountered by the Committees during this mini-budget process.  In that respect, the Committee looks forward to receiving a briefing from DFP  officials on 12 May on the outcome of DFP&rsquo;s review of the Executive&rsquo;s Budget  process 2008-2011, which was originally due for completion by the end of 2008.  That should inform the establishment of an effective process for determining  future Budgets. It will also enable the Committee to move forward with the  second phase of stage 1 of its inquiry into Budget scrutiny, which it aims to  complete before the summer recess.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">12.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee also intends to press ahead with stage 2 of  its inquiry, which will review the resources available for assisting Statutory  Committees and Assembly Members in undertaking budgetary and financial scrutiny  and will seek to identify any recommendations necessary to enhance the capacity  of the Assembly in that regard. The Committee intends to complete stage 2 of  its inquiry in advance of the summer recess.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee for Finance and Personnel remains committed  to maximising the Assembly&rsquo;s contribution to the Executive&rsquo;s Budget process and  to enhancing the role of the Assembly&rsquo;s Statutory Committees and Members in  budgetary and financial scrutiny. The Committee looks forward to engaging with  DFP and with the other Statutory Committees over the coming months and to  ensuring that an effective Budget process is established for future years.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At its meeting tomorrow, the Committee will also be taking  the opportunity to question DFP officials on the detail of the revised 2010-11  spending plans.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Business Committee has arranged to meet immediately upon the  lunchtime suspension. I therefore propose, by leave of the Assembly, to suspend  the sitting until 2.00 pm.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The sitting was suspended at 12.31 pm.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic" style="page-break-before:always;">On resuming (Mr  Speaker in the Chair) &mdash;</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Social Development (Mr Hamilton)</strong>: I will begin by  making a few comments as the Chairperson of the Committee for Social  Development.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee considered the revised depart&shy;mental  expenditure plans for the Department for Social Development on several  occasions in January, February and March 2010. I am sure that I will not be the  only Committee Chairperson to express my disappointment at the behaviour of  Departments &mdash; in this case, the Department for Social Development &mdash; the lack of  detail in the initial departmental submissions and the questions that remain  unanswered from subsequent briefings. If our Committees are to be as robust and  effective as we know they can be through our participation in them, it is  imperative that, when dealing with fundamental issues such as the Budget and  the expenditure plans for an incoming financial year, Departments divulge those  plans as quickly and fully as possible. Sadly, that was not the case with the  information that my Committee received.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will make a couple of comments based on the information  that has been provided and focus on some of the areas where the Committee has  concerns about the adjustments that have been made. A primary concern is the  Housing Executive&rsquo;s capital improvement programme for 2010-11. The overall  reductions to that programme might be as significant as &pound;40 million and could  affect many deprived areas and estates throughout Northern Ireland. I would welcome  further clarification from the Department for Social Development on the funding  for those important capital projects.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee expressed concern initially that the  Department was just apportioning 2&middot;6% downward adjustments for each of its  business areas, even though the Minister and the Executive did not take that  approach. The Committee was concerned that that sort of salami-slicing approach  was not particularly effective, and it was concerned about some of the areas  that were being hit, such as capital projects and community develop&shy;ment. Many  members of the Committee are embroiled in their communities and in working to  improve those communities, and they are concerned about the effect that the  adjustments may have in deprived and disadvantaged communities across Northern  Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the two and a half minutes that remain available to me,  I want to talk about some of the generalities around the revised expenditure  plans. Neither I, the Minister nor anyone else speaks with any relish about  downward adjustments of any kind. Listening to some Members and their party  colleagues, you would think that they were licking their lips at the very  thought of making significant cuts to budgets. That is not something that I  want to do. However, in accepting what is before us today, we have to recall  why we are all here. I am not asking why we are here in an existential sense; I  am asking why we are here today dealing with the revised departmental  expenditure plans. We are doing that because of decisions that we have taken,  decisions that the Executive have taken and decisions that we all agree with.  The primary example, as the Minister outlined before the lunchtime break, is  the deferral of water charges and the &pound;200 million associated cost. That was a  good decision, and it was the right decision at the time. However, it does not  come without consequences.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Another example is the resolution of the Civil Service  equal pay claim. A resolution to that was something that we all wanted to see  and something that Finance Ministers had repeatedly sought to achieve. The  present Finance Minister, Mr Wilson, has managed to achieve a resolution. However,  that has not come without a cost: some &pound;155 million to &pound;170 million in total, a  large chunk of which has to be paid this year. There are also central  adjustments that the Minister talked about coming down from Whitehall. Those are all our own decisions;  they were all agreed by the Executive and by every party in the Assembly.  However, there are consequences for taking those decisions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the fact that the adjustments have not been made  crudely by apportioning them equally across Departments. Some measure of  protection has been afforded to critical services such as health and, in  keeping with our objective to grow a dynamic and vibrant economy, there has  been a measure of comparative protection for DEL and DETI so that we can try to continue  to stimulate growth in our economy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also put on record my support for the invest to save  scheme. I see that there are some very good, innovative schemes in the  finalised plans, which is an overall principle that we all want to see  continued. I support the motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  The Minister will be well aware of the difficulties that his Department is  causing throughout Northern    Ireland. Not having an agreed Budget at this  stage of the financial year is unprecedented. Are we carrying out something  that is legally safe? Is it not true that legal opinion has been sought by at  least one Department and that further legal consideration would give cause for  concern with regard to the revised Budget&rsquo;s introduction in the House today? I  have some serious reservations about the manner in which the revised spending  plans have been brought before the House today.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Section 64(1) of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 states:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The Minister of Finance and Personnel shall, before  the beginning of each financial year, lay before the Assembly a draft budget&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Can any of us imagine the Chancellor of the  Exchequer or any other Finance Minister throughout Europe  missing the deadline for his own Budget, as ours has? I understand that the  plans were agreed by the Business Committee on 13 April 2010, some eight days  after the end of the financial year. Will the Minister reassure the House that  the Budget is legal? Will he also inform the House as to when the revised  programme was agreed by the Executive? Along with every other Member, I received  a copy of the plans and a letter from the Minister on 12 April 2010. Had the  Executive agreed the plans at that stage? It is my understanding that they had  not.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, will the Minister guarantee that we will not  have to revisit the plans because they are open to legal challenge? If the  process is proven to be unsafe, what is the Minister&rsquo;s fallback position? Has  he taken any legal advice on what we are doing today? What advice has he  received from the Departmental Solicitor&rsquo;s Office? What is the legal position  of the Attorney General, who is the person ultimately responsible for legal  direction? Is the Attorney General, John Larkin, in post, or will that pose a  problem for the Assembly?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The entire process illustrates a mismanaged Department. The  DUP is responsible for the Finance Department. We all know that yesterday it  launched its manifesto, which contained a large number of mostly spurious ideas  and commitments but absolutely no information on how the party will pay for  them. Not surprisingly, given how it has mismanaged the Finance Department and  given the waffle that we will hear at the Dispatch Box later, all fears have  been confirmed. The manifesto is a manifesto of waffle that has earned them a  deserved reputation as a party of financial mismanagement and fiscal  irresponsibility. At a time when the United Kingdom needs serious  politicians who have the best interests of the union at heart, what the DUP is  offering is simply not good enough. The party will know that on 6 May.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have posed serious questions to the House and the  Minister that deserve serious consideration and response. I have to say, in  case the Minister attacks me later, that I might not be here to hear his  response because of other commitments. However, I can read the Hansard report.  I commend that idea to other Members, who will be able to see the cackling in  it. I have raised issues of undoubted importance. Last Thursday, the Ulster  Unionist Party&rsquo;s two Executive Ministers, when placed in circumstances that  were not to their liking, voted against the revised Budget as an expression of  their revulsion, disbelief and discontent at the manner in which the Executive  dealt with the revised Budget. I make that statement of intent on behalf of my  Ministers and my party. The Minister must recognise that, and I hope that he  will do so.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  The motion asks the Assembly to approve the revised programme of expenditure  proposals for 2010-11. That is not a proposal to which I or my party can give  assent, and, if necessary, we shall divide the Assembly on it. That is  consistent with the position of my party, which has had great concerns about  the budgetary arrangements over the past three years. Unfortunately, I think  that our stance has been vindicated.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The document on the Minster&rsquo;s spending plans states:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;There have been a large number of significant changes  to the public expenditure environment since the Budget 2008-11 document&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Indeed, it spends a whole chapter outlining those  changes. We know the headings such as the overcommitment; the failure of the  capital assets realisation programme; the deferment of water charges; and the  equal pay issue. Of course, other pressures always arise. This year, two of the  larger pressures have been Bombardier and swine flu. However, no contingency  fund or other arrangement has been put in place to address those issues. The  document fails to address not only those fiscal issues but the other big change  in the environment, namely the economic downturn. We have consistently argued  that the Budget ought to have been fundamentally rewritten to address that situation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Of course, when we look into this year, we should  be preparing for a future after the Westminster  election. Although no one knows what will happen in this financial year, it is  almost certain that, for the next financial year, any Government there will be  faced with the position of bringing their Budget back into regularity. The  consequences here are likely to be considerable.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We feel that the issue of the economic downturn and the  building up of our economy has not been adequately addressed. The Minister  knows that, and he said that we were not doing enough on the economy. He is reported in one press  statement as saying that: </p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;it is difficult to see any significant change in  policy focus towards economic growth over the last few years.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I can only agree with the Minister, but I have to ask him what is being done in the Budget to address that issue.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also ask the Minister what led to his U-turn on corporation  tax, which I  greatly regret.  Many of us believed that that policy objective was a key issue in turning our economy around, and it was recently proposed by  the Economic Reform Group. Presenting our case is all the more difficult when  the Minister is expressing a high level of scepticism. The Minister has not  considered a number of corporation tax issues, such as a possible phasing-in of  the tax and the fact that the current corporation tax take is very small. We  always factored in the cost in our support for that arrangement. Is there not  confidence that that policy measure would pay for itself? That was the whole  point of the proposed corporation tax policy measure.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The one element of the Minister&rsquo;s paper of which I greatly  approve is the invest to save proposal. Given our economic situation and future  budget, serious public sector reform must be undertaken. My only complaints  about the invest to save proposal are that it is too meagre and should have  happened a considerable time ago. It is too little, too late.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister&rsquo;s officials appeared before the Committee for  Finance and Personnel last week and talked only about PEDU.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I ask the Member to draw his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  His officials were unable to present any forward work programme for PEDU, which  is the Minister&rsquo;s one significant initiative for public sector reform.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  This is my first comment to the House in a different context, given that I am  no longer a Member of the loyal opposition. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span> However, the Alliance Party will continue to take a constructively critical  view of coming Assembly decisions, although we shall demonstrate the  responsibility that comes with being a party on the Executive.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive and the House have an obligation to ensure  that we have a Budget in place. There may be issues about the process to date and  about whether we should have had three Budgets or a three-year Budget, which we  are now modifying. However, those are secondary to issues of substance, such as  where we are going with the money. My party leader supported that issue in the  Executive. The Budget was inherited, but that support reflects our sense of the  importance of moving forward as opposed to an endorsement of the detail, and  there will obviously be discussions in the years ahead. I am not going to go  down the road of making an election speech. Suffice it to say that I was rather  &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I thank the Member for giving way. The Member&rsquo;s introductory remarks remind me  of the comment by the late Michael Foot about David Steel on a famous  parliamentary occasion, when he said that he had:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;passed from rising hope to elder statesman without  any intervening period whatsoever&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  Given my lack of grey hairs compared with those of Mr Kennedy, I am not quite  sure about that one. However, I am impressed by the ability of the Conservative  Member for Newry and Armagh to quote left-wing  socialist firebrands to make his point. I was rather amused to hear the  Conservative Party lambaste other parties for not providing costings in their  manifestos.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member has an extra minute.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. Other parties here are not claiming that they  will be part of a future Government; rather, they are trying to influence  decisions. However, I note that Mr McNarry&rsquo;s party is intent on forming part of  the Government. It may be worth reflecting on the fact that there were no  costings in the Conservative manifesto that was unveiled last week.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to mention issues on which we have gone wrong in the  past and on which we must make progress in the future. There are major  distortions in Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s public finances. We have talked  about the cost of division, a matter about which I will say no more today. The  ongoing deferral of water charges has created the major difficulty of where to  find the money to meet that loss of revenue. That is on top of the issues that  have knocked the Budget off course over the past months, which the Minister  outlined.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Looking to the future, Departments are being asked to trim  the sails of their public expenditure plans. That may well be a precursor to  further rationing. In a sense, it is easy for us to talk about cuts in terms of  what will be lost. However, we never get the chance to discuss the missed  opportunities &mdash; things that we could have done but have been unable to because  we do not have the required resources. In some respects, that is the missing  link in our current discussions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I concur with Declan O&rsquo;Loan&rsquo;s view on the importance of  corporation tax as a stimulus to our economy and as a way to find a step change  towards closing the productivity gap with the rest of the UK. I disagree  with him that the Finance Minister has done a U-turn on the issue: it is more  like a 360&deg; turn. He has done two U-turns and is now back on board, lobbying  for a change in corporation tax that is important to Northern Ireland. It is not a clear  missed opportunity in the sense that we must lobby the Treasury to put it in  place, but the House should unite on taking the campaign forward.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also want to stress the importance of the manner in which  we address efficiencies in Departments. Far too often, efficiencies mean cuts  to front line services, increased charges levied by Departments or Departments  doing less. We need to focus on the true meaning of efficiencies &mdash; productivity  gain and achieving greater outcomes with less available inputs.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the concept of the invest to save fund and the  initial steps being taken to implement it. In the future, that could become a  vehicle for further expansion. Will the Minister consider earmarking a specific  percentage of the block grant in years to come for initiatives such as invest  to save so that we can encourage innovation? My party believes that areas like  the cost of division present clear opportunities to take that forward.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, will the Minister clarify whether there were any  changes in the revised public expenditure figures? Are they different to those  that were issued in draft for public consultation?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education (Mr Storey)</strong>: As Chairperson of the Committee  for Education, I wish first to place it on record that I share the concern of  my colleague Mr Hamilton, the Chairperson of the Social Development Committee,  about the lack of information provided to Statutory Committees. I refer  particularly to the lack of information provided by the Department of  Education, despite repeated requests to that Department and its Minister. I  note that paragraph 5.5 of the Executive&rsquo;s revised spending plans document  comments thus on the level of engagements by Departments with Assembly Committees:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;the Committee for Finance and Personnel highlighted  the need for established protocols for the provision of timely and appropriate  budgetary information to Assembly committees.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">As Chairperson of the Education Committee, I ask  this: what protocols have been put in place to ensure that appropriate  information is given to Committees so that they can give assistance and advice?  Members will recall that one of the current Minister of Education&rsquo;s get-out  clauses has been that the Education Committee has not given her any advice.  Well, the Committee will give advice on the basis of appropriate information  that is provided to it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee for Education&rsquo;s submission of 5 February to the  Committee for Finance and Personnel highlighted why it was not in a position to  consider or give its views on a number of departmental proposals. The Minister  of Education identified five areas of potential reductions, but no information  was provided on the impact of those reductions. I remind Members of what those  five areas were. The first was the reduction in bureaucracy and streamlining of  services in relation to education and library boards, the Council for Catholic  Maintained Schools (CCMS) and other non-departmental bodies that are serviced  by the Department of Education. The second was Classroom 2000 (C2k), which is  the computer system in our schools. It has an annual budget in excess of &pound;50  million. We wanted to know what impact a reduction would have on that  programme. The third area of potential reduction was the entitlement framework,  something which the Education Minister is wedded to and closely associated  with. However, she wanted to take almost &pound;5&middot;5 million out of the entitlement  framework budget. What impact would that have on the delivery of the  entitlement framework, which will be a statutory requirement in 2013? The two  other areas identified were the school improvement programme and the Council  for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment (CCEA), which is the  organisation that was set up to assess and test &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  Does the Member agree that it is totally and absolutely outrageous that the  Minister of Education has withdrawn a mere &pound;85,000 from the I CAN early years  centre in Ballynahinch, which has deprived 20 young children of speech and  language therapy? Those youngsters will not get that service anywhere else. I  have seen the good work that has been done at that centre, and the Minister&rsquo;s  decision is an absolute disgrace. She should hang her head in shame.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member has an extra minute in which to speak.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education</strong>: I concur with the Member and his comments  about what the Minister should do, and I speak as a Member of the House rather  than as Chairperson of the Committee for Education. The Committee has received  correspondence in relation to that issue. In a moment or two, I will highlight  another situation that is equally disgraceful.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The aim of the convergence delivery plan is to remove  duplication and streamline educational services. When that was brought to the  Education Committee, we had not received all of the information. As Chairperson  of the Education Committee, I am raising an issue that is probably relevant to  other Committees also: there is a delay in having appropriate papers brought to  Committees to enable them to scrutinise effectively the work of the Executive.  That has to change radically. In respect of the Minister of Education in  particular, it has to change big time.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The review of the education capital programme is a very  important issue. I remind the House of a statement that impinges on this  Budget, which was made by the Education Minister on 27 July 2009 in relation to  Whitehouse Primary School, which had been  destroyed. I commend the North Eastern Education and Library Board, the school  and others for the way in which the school was relocated. A promise was given  by the Education Minister, who said:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;My Department is also working to progress the planned  new school as quickly as possible and we would hope construction can start  later this year.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Now, in 2010, the contracts have run out of time.  Not a sod has been turned in relation to Whitehouse Primary School.  That situation, along with the one in Ballynahinch, is an absolute disgrace.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: Does the Member agree that what makes the situation  even more unacceptable is that an Irish-medium school that burnt down at the  same time is now practically rebuilt while youngsters in Whitehouse Primary School  are left without proper premises?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education</strong>: I agree with the Member. It is another  example of inequality in respect of the delivery of capital projects in the  Department of Education.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member should bring his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Education</strong>: The bottom line is that the Education  Committee should have been in a position to give advice about areas of help.  However, appropriate information was not given by the Department to the  Committee to make those decisions.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for the Environment (Mr Boylan)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a  Cheann Comhairle. I welcome the opportunity to outline the Committee for the  Environment&rsquo;s views on the Department of the Environment&rsquo;s revised expenditure  plans for 2010-11.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee was briefed by departmental officials at the  start of the year. Members were left in no doubt that the Department faces  significant financial pressures.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The &pound;4 million savings required by the Executive,  combined with a significant shortfall in planning fees, the cost of planning  reform and the review of public administration, result in the Department being  called on to make savings of 11&middot;3% in its baseline budget.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee generally welcomed the Department&rsquo;s proposals  for achieving those savings, which include reducing the amount that it spends  on consultants, lowering its running costs and reviewing its corporate service  functions. Members were pleased to hear that the Department intends to focus  its staff cost savings on not filling vacancies in order to avoid the upfront  costs involved in rapidly addressing staff numbers. They were also pleased to  hear that the Department will bring the Planning Service&rsquo;s operating costs into  line with the reduced fees that are now being received. That issue has  concerned the Committee for some time.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Planning receipts have been in rapid decline since 2007,  and members feel that the Depart&shy;ment should have sought to relocate staff to  maximise efficiency much sooner. However, Members remain concerned about the  impact that that will have on non-governmental organisations, and, since the  Committee alerted the House to its concerns during the take-note debate in  February, several organisations have been in touch with the Committee to  express their concern about cuts that they are facing in funding from the  Department. Unlike the Department, those organisations do not have the  opportunity to relocate staff, and they will have to make people redundant.  That is not just a loss for the organisation; it is a loss for everyone here.  It will lead to a loss of expertise from the sector or the region, and possibly  even the deterioration of the environment. Some organisations affected by the  decision deliver or contribute to statutory environmental protection  obligations, and cutting their funding may not be the most cost effective  approach in the longer term if it leads to further deterioration of protected  sites and/or EU infraction proceedings.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Does the Member agree that funding is a particular issue for the Mourne  Heritage Trust? The very issues that he mentioned are very much in evidence  when we see the excellent work carried out by the trust around the Mourne and  Slieve Croob areas of south Down.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>: I  agree with the Member, but we will find that a lot of organisations will lose  funding over the next while, and we need to address that. Other organisations  provide services to a range of citizens who will be left at a disadvantage in  the absence of that funding.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department allayed some of the Committee members&rsquo;  concerns by indicating that it is looking at options such as phasing out grants  over a longer period and targeting organisations that have a variety of funding  streams available to them and are, therefore, not solely dependent on the  Department&rsquo;s funding. That is to be welcomed. The Committee also welcomed the  fact that the Department is liaising closely with the organisations that are  affected, but has asked for details so that the Committee can assess the real  impact of the Department&rsquo;s funding cut proposals over time.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee urges the Department to base any decision to  cut funding on recent and impartial information about the service or function  provided. That must include assessment of the need for a service or function,  as well as the value for money that the organisation is providing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee would also like to see the Department giving  an opportunity to organisations to be offered reduced budgets in the first  instance, rather than simply cutting grants. That will allow organisations to  find ways to survive the current financial constraints and retain expertise  both for our citizens and the environment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, the Committee stressed the importance of using  powers afforded by the Audit Office to data match information across  Departments and ensure that any receipts for any breaches for which the  Department of the Environment has responsibility are maximised. We live in  uncertain economic times, and tough measures have to be taken to ensure that  savings are made and value for money is being achieved. The Environment  Committee understands that, but it urges the Department to find its savings  carefully and with an eye on the longer term. Short-termism now could have a  detrimental impact on the environment for many years to come, and it could cost  our economy much more in the long run. Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr Wells)</strong>:  On behalf of the Committee, I should like to point out that we are unable to  give a substantive comment in this debate. That is because Minister McGimpsey  has still not supplied a detailed breakdown of how he intends to implement the  proposed additional savings across his Department. In fact, the situation has  not changed since the revised expenditure plans were last debated in the House  in February. That is not to say that the Committee has been sitting on its  hands on the issue. We took evidence from the Minister and officials, and we  wrote to the Minister on a number of occasions regarding the revised  expenditure and other budgets, particularly the budget for swine flu. We are  still waiting for the Minister to give us his detailed proposals. Four months  later, the Committee is still in the dark as to what is happening. Why is the  Minister not providing us with the information?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I have listened to the catalogue of concerns that  the Member has expressed about the health budget. Does he find it incongruous  that, on one hand, the spokesman for the Ulster Unionist Party has talked about  the manner in which this budget has been presented, the financial mismanagement  and the difficulties that are being caused by lack of information, yet on the  other hand, one of the Ministers from his party has not supplied any  information to his Committee?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I can say  only that it has not been particularly helpful of the Minister to behave in  such a manner. The Committee, which has oversight of the largest budget in the  Assembly, is unanimous in the belief that this is making its life difficult. We  are getting little or no information from the Minister. We know that  implementing the revised spending plans without affecting front line services  will be difficult, but the total silence from the Department on the issue is  worrying.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I know that the Minister publicly took the position that  the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety should be exempt  from having to make any additional savings &mdash; in other words, that his  Department should not be subject to the proposed additional savings of &pound;92  million in revenue and &pound;21&middot;5 million in capital funding. The issue, however,  has moved beyond the point where there was ever the slimmest possibility of  that happening. The delay from the Minister is causing problems and issues in  the health and social care community. It is creating uncertainty and a vacuum,  in which all sorts of stories and scaremongering are occurring. That is not  responsible leadership on behalf of the Department and Minister.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the past few months, the Committee has received numerous  letters and correspondence from a wide range of groups involved in the health  and social care sector. As a Committee, as individual members and as MLAs, we  have also met, formally and informally, with such groups. All such groups are  focusing their energies on funding, trying to make a case for their speciality  and defending that case. They are trying to make the case for protecting the  funding of stroke victims, heart attack patients, children in care, people with  eye problems and people who are looking for help with the elderly, for  instance.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Let me make it clear: there is considerable worry in the  community about next year&rsquo;s health and social care funding, and that worry is  exacerbated by the total lack of information and by bad news stories such as  those relating to increases in waiting lists.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee intends to start to look at the strategy for  acute hospitals across Northern    Ireland. Even that piece of work is  dependent on information on funding. Rumours are rife about whether this or  that hospital is to be built or to remain open. We need information and answers  as soon as possible.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  Turn over the page.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: This  certainly cramps my style.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We are into the 2010-11 financial year. Do the health and  social care trusts know what their budgets will be? How can they plan and  deliver effectively and efficiently in such circumstances? Initially, the  Committee had some sympathy and understanding for the pressures facing the  Minister and the health and social care sector; it understands that demand is  increasing and that funding is limited. However, any sympathy and understanding  for the job that the Minister is doing is slowly eroding as we continue to look  into the black hole of no information.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The situation is not good enough; something has to be done.  I understand that the Committee for Finance and Personnel is undertaking an  inquiry into the role of the Northern Ireland Assembly in scrutinising the  Executive&rsquo;s Budget and expenditure. I urge that Committee to consider ways in  which information flow can be secured. It is not acceptable to allow  Departments to totally ignore their Statutory Committees and not provide  information. We need some teeth, some way in which the Minister has to be  accountable to the Committee on this important issue.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><span class="BoldText">The Chairperson of the Committee  for the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister (Mr Kennedy)</span>:  I welcome the opportunity to address the House on this issue. The Minister of  Finance and Personnel launched a consultation on the outcome of the Executive&rsquo;s  review of the 2010-11 spending plans in the Assembly on 12 January. The  Executive proposed a reduction to OFMDFM&rsquo;s budget allocation in 2010-11 of &pound;4&middot;1  million of current expenditure, which is a reduction of 5%, and a reduction of  &pound;5&middot;2 million in capital investment, which represents a 30% reduction.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At the outset, I wish to express the Committee&rsquo;s concern  that due to the late receipt of proposals from the Department &mdash; there seems to  be a theme emerging here &mdash; the Committee was unable to scrutinise fully the  Department&rsquo;s proposals for reductions in the 2010-11 financial year. The  Committee did not receive the Department&rsquo;s proposals until after the take-note  debate on Tuesday 9 February, which left the Committee little opportunity to  consider the Department&rsquo;s proposals in detail.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Officials from OFMDFM briefed the Committee on their  proposals for reductions in the 2010-11 financial year on Wednesday 10  February, after which we highlighted our concerns, including the timescales for  decisions regarding the Civic Forum and when an international relations  strategy will be developed. The Committee regards this strategy &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption]</span>.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Speaker, it appears that some Members regard the affairs  of south Down as more important than the uniquely and distinctly important  speech of the Chairperson of the OFMDFM Committee. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span> I have been accused of making moving speeches, but none quite as moving as  this.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee regards that strategy as an important tool  for promoting Northern Ireland  in Europe, North America and elsewhere.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee also noted the Department&rsquo;s work to address  the number of appeals that come before the Planning Appeals Commission; the  figure is down from 2,800 to 943. However, we remain concerned about whether  the commission has sufficient staffing resources and funding to handle the  substantial number of area plans and article 31 inquiries outstanding.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee also received a briefing from the Office of  the First Minister and the deputy First Minister on 14 April 2010 on its  organisational restructuring, which will reduce the number of posts in the  Department by 51 and which, when fully implemented, will deliver projected  savings of &pound;1&middot;5 million in administration costs and &pound;0&middot;3 million in resource  costs. The Committee awaits further information from the Department on that  issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On behalf of the Committee, I place on record its concern  over the continuing late receipt of financial papers from the Department, as  that delay restricts the Committee&rsquo;s ability to fulfil its scrutiny function.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure (Mr McElduff)</strong>: Go raibh  maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. The Culture, Arts and Leisure Committee took  evidence from departmental officials on the proposed revised budget for 2010-11  at a meeting on Thursday 28 January. The Committee was disappointed that, as a  percentage, the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure (DCAL) suffered the  highest cuts of all Departments. The Committee is of the view that DCAL is  sometimes regarded as a soft target for budgetary cuts because the impact of  its business areas is not fully recognised or understood.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee makes the point that investment in DCAL  business areas contributes to key areas of economic growth, such as cultural  tourism and the creative industries. Such activities have the potential to  generate jobs and attract tourists to this region. However, the Committee  welcomes the recent news that there will be an increase of &pound;1&middot;4 million to the  Department&rsquo;s budget under the invest to save programme. I understand that that  money will be ring-fenced to allow Libraries NI to embark on its third tranche of  redundancies, which are required at middle management level to realise the  long-term savings that were made possible by the creation of a single library  authority this time last year. That is a positive step that will, ultimately,  deliver better value for money.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee has a number of concerns about the  consultation process for the revised Budget. The Committees were afforded  limited time in which to scrutinise the cuts that their Departments were  proposing. The majority of DCAL&rsquo;s budget is distributed by arm&rsquo;s-length bodies:  more than 80% of its functions are delivered in that way. One such body, Sport  NI, will lose &pound;2 million. How can Sport NI deliver the Sport Matters strategy  with the loss of &pound;2 million?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee would, of course, have preferred a longer  consultation period in which to obtain from those bodies thorough and detailed  information on how the cuts will impact on their ability to deliver front line  services. The Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure joins other Committees in  requesting that, in future, the Executive set out a Budget process that allows  for proper and considered engagement between Committees and Departments.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee for Regional Development (Miss McIlveen)</strong>: I  welcome the opportunity to speak in today&rsquo;s debate. The Committee for Regional  Development has presented its concerns about funding levels for structural road  maintenance at every available opportunity. As Members will be aware, the  Snaith review, a recent independent review of structural road maintenance,  found that &pound;108 million a year was needed to maintain the structural integrity  of the entire road network at good-practice resurfacing frequencies. Structural  maintenance spend for 2009-2010 was around &pound;85 million, which was &pound;23 million  below the recommended level. That &pound;23 million underfunding is additional to the  existing &pound;700 million backlog in structural maintenance.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Underfunding of structural maintenance cannot continue. The  quality of our road network underpins Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  competitive position, enhancing journey time and reliability for businesses,  bringing tourists from our ports and airports to the wide variety of leisure  and cultural attractions throughout Northern Ireland and ensuring  access to healthcare, education, training and employment opportunities for all  our citizens.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The final impact of this year&rsquo;s prolonged periods of severe  winter weather has yet to be quantified. However, it is clear that the  condition of our roads has deteriorated seriously over recent months.  Prioritising the economy means prioritising structural road maintenance, and  the Committee for Regional Development is calling for additional in-year  funding to at least the &pound;108 million recommended by the Snaith review, together  with allocations to address the backlog of more than &pound;700 million.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee is aware that additional allocations have  been made to the Department for Regional Development (DRD) for the provision of  water and sewerage services, and it will schedule more detailed briefings from  the Department on the final revisions to the Executive&rsquo;s spending plans,  including the funding of water and sewerage services. However, I am taking this  opportunity to reiterate the Committee&rsquo;s view that the funding of water and  sewerage services is a matter for the Executive and must not have a detrimental  effect on DRD&rsquo;s budget and its ability to deliver much-needed investment in  roads and public transport.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Spending on public infrastructure, such as roads and public  transport, has been shown internationally to support and stimulate growth  across the whole economy. Such investment is never more cost-effective than  during a period of economic downturn. The Committee has commissioned a research  paper on that subject, which is available on the Assembly&rsquo;s website, and it  will support continued infrastructure investment to ensure that Northern Ireland  is in the best place possible to take advantage of the recovery when it comes.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, the level of engagement in revising the  Executive&rsquo;s expenditure plan for next year has been far from perfect. As the  Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for Regional Development, I welcome the  Executive&rsquo;s recognition of the need to consider that as part of the Budget 2010  process and look forward to the speedy development of a clearer Budget cycle  that also allows adequate time for meaningful engagement between Committees and  Departments.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Employment and Learning (Mrs D Kelly)</strong>: I welcome the  opportunity to participate in the debate. The spending review is tremendously  important to all people. It is vital that they see that the issues that  surround it are discussed on the Floor of the Assembly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At its meeting on 27 January 2010, the Committee for  Employment and Learning was briefed by departmental officials on details of the  impact of the review of the 2010-11 spending plans on the Department for  Employment and Learning&rsquo;s budget. The Committee questioned the departmental  officials and discussed issues that arose from that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At its meeting on 3 February, the Committee agreed a  response to the Chairperson of the Committee for Finance and Personnel to  inform that Committee&rsquo;s report on the spending review. My comments will be  based on that response. Generally, the Committee believes that the Department  has put a positive slant on the spending review by emphasising that cuts had to  be made from what is termed &ldquo;growth&rdquo; &mdash; that is, increased budget allocation &mdash; rather  than a baseline budget projection. It confirms that it will still be able to  deliver on public service agreement (PSA) targets and Programme for Government  key goals. Obviously, the Committee will want to hold the Department to account  in the delivery of those targets.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The total spending reduction is &pound;28&middot;7 million, of which  savings of &pound;19&middot;7 million are to be made from current revenue expenditure and &pound;9  million from the capital expenditure budget. I would be pleased to hear what  the Minister had to say if the Assembly or the Executive tried to put money  into infrastructure projects in order to kick-start the construction industry:  how would that sit with that Executive objective? Current expenditure and  capital cuts will be made primarily from the higher education budget, with a  cut of &pound;12&middot;8 million to be made from the current expenditure budget, which is  65% of the total of &pound;19&middot;7 million; and &pound;8&middot;1 million from capital expenditure,  which is 90% of the total of &pound;9 million.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee has received representations from the higher  education sector about the outcome of the spending review and has responded to  them. There are no planned cuts to further education. However, that depends on  &pound;10 million being realised as capital receipts. The Committee commends the  Minister for the considerable sums that his Department has invested in the  sector in recent years. It is pleased to see that that investment is being  protected.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, at lunchtime, I returned from a meeting on  programme-led apprenticeships at which key stakeholders, such as departmental  officials, representatives from the further education sector and employers&rsquo;  representatives, were present. Concerns were raised about whether programme-led  apprenticeships are the right way forward. The further education  representatives were clear that uptake in that sector has risen quite  considerably. They questioned whether there are sufficient funds to deliver and  to meet the needs of young people who join up and seek places on those  apprenticeships because of the lack of employment opportunities elsewhere.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">During discussions at a previous meeting, the Committee  also raised the following concerns. As regards current expenditure, it is  acutely aware of the importance of the delivery of skills and training,  particularly the value of apprenticeships. Members expressed concern that  budget cuts of &pound;6 million would impact on the programme-led apprenticeship  schemes. However, we received assurances from officials that the remaining  increase in funding of &pound;17&middot;4 million would protect training services. I am sure  that the debate on the value of programme-led apprenticeships will continue in  meetings during the next few weeks.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As regards capital expenditure, the strategic capital  investment fund for universities and university colleges has been reduced from  &pound;14 million to &pound;5&middot;9 million. Members were concerned about how that would impact  on universities&rsquo; future expansion plans, which have been outlined to the  Committee recently. Officials made it clear that that funding was the only area  of the higher education budget that had not yet been formally committed. On  that basis, the Committee has accepted that it would have a more limited  immediate effect on the development of higher education.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I indicated, the Committee welcomed the lack of cuts  that are planned for the further education sector. However, it expressed  concern that that depends critically on planned capital receipts of &pound;10 million  being fully realised.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Officials outlined the possible impact on ongoing  further education projects that would have to be scaled back. Generally, the  Committee believes that the Minister for Employment and Learning and his  officials have made a considered effort to minimise the impact of the spending  review, which Committee members support. However, they will seek to scrutinise  and hold the Department and the Minister to account on the delivery of the PSA  targets and the Programme for Government goals.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Question Time will commence at 3.00 pm. This debate will continue after  Question Time, when the Minister will respond and conclude the debate. The  sitting is, by leave, suspended until 3.00 pm.</p>

    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  To give the House some advance notice, I advise Members that Question 4 has  been withdrawn.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Urban Regeneration: Shared Space</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">1. <strong>Dr  Farry </strong>asked the Minister for Social Development to outline her Department&rsquo;s  efforts to promote shared space within urban regeneration projects. (AQO  1077/10<a name="AQO1077/10" id="AQO1077/10"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development (Ms Ritchie)</strong>: The creation of shared space and  ultimately a shared future permeates the work of my Department. I have placed  the issue at the heart of all my endeavours as Minister for Social Development.  In urban regeneration, it takes the form of creating physical developments that  are open and welcoming to all.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My Department is taking forward approximately 50 master  plans and up to 70 public realm schemes across Northern Ireland&rsquo;s towns and  cities. As a core objective, the work aims to make public spaces attractive and  safe and create spaces in which people can live, work and relax whatever their  background or section 75 grouping. It means the creation of animated spaces and  opportunities for events and celebrations that bring people together and  promote interaction.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In deprived areas, which are the focus of neighbourhood  renewal, the creation of a shared future is an important priority. We cannot  move forward with tackling disadvantage in our most deprived communities  without making them safer and more welcoming for all. To achieve that goal, my  Department meets and engages with community groups throughout Northern Ireland.  However, the work on a shared future cannot be done alone, and my Department  works in partnership with other central government Departments and agencies  including the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister, which  takes the lead on the issue. The Department also works with its partners in  local government and the voluntary and community sector to progress the  community development and physical regeneration work that is within the remit  of DSD.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  thank the Minister for her answer. I was pleased that she recognised that  shared space is more than just an issue for Protestants and Catholics and is  much more wide-ranging. Will the Minister confirm whether work is being done to  find an agreed definition of shared space across Departments? Furthermore, the  Minister detailed the various partners she and her Department are working with.  Is she also working with DOE and DRD, with their respective responsibilities  for planning and roads, to ensure that they interact with her Department and  others to make shared space work? The concept cuts across departmental lines.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I shall take the second part of the Member&rsquo;s  supplementary question first: my Department already works with the Planning  Service &mdash; and the DOE per se &mdash; in the development of master plans, public realm  work and regeneration generally. The first part of the Member&rsquo;s supplementary  question dealt with the definition of a shared future. For me, that is very  definitely about shared space, developing reconciliation and moving on to that  new phase in politics. I was disappointed with the draft cohesion, sharing and  integration strategy document, which is all that OFMDFM has produced in that  area after three years of doing nothing. The document is completely devoid of  any proposals and is perhaps one of the worst documents I have ever seen. I am  going to do my best to get a shared future back on track, because I am perhaps  the only Minister to have done anything to promote shared space and a shared  future. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: Building a shared future is the biggest challenge for  everyone in the Assembly, the Executive and the wider community of Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>:  Shared space in urban regeneration, which was the subject of the original  question, is not welcomed by everyone in society. Those who are blind or  visually impaired worry, in particular, about town centres having shared spaces  without kerbs, as they find it difficult to differentiate between pedestrian  spaces and those used by traffic.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member should come to his question.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>:  Will the Minister ensure that the shared space concepts that she is involved in  will not create no-go areas for those who are blind or visually impaired?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I ensure the Member that the Department has worked in  strenuous ways with, for example, people in Belfast City Centre Management to  develop shared spaces for those with disabilities and visual impairments.  Indeed, the Department facilitated the creation of disabled parking spaces in  the provision of public realm.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Reference was made to the issue of shared space, and it may  be worthwhile for the Assembly to note that I am wholeheartedly committed to my  Department&rsquo;s ongoing work in creating shared spaces and, in particular, a shared  future. For example, through the integrated development fund, my Department  contributed &pound;500,000 to a &pound;1&middot;2 million commercial community facility that rests  on the interface between the Suffolk and  Lenadoon estates in west Belfast.  That is one way in which we can create a shared space. It may interest the  Member for North Down Dr Farry to know that we are working strenuously to  remove the plinths, which are anathema to a shared future and shared space,  from his constituency. I hope that that problem can be resolved.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  I applaud the Minister&rsquo;s commitment to a shared future. It is an important  commitment, and it is regrettable that others do not share it. Specifically,  what is the Minister&rsquo;s assessment of the progress that has been achieved on the  Victoria Square  regeneration project?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: The &pound;400 million Victoria Square development has been a  resounding success in providing a shared space for all citizens and sections of  the community to share and enjoy. It is a dynamic space that provides living,  employment and leisure opportunities for people from Belfast,  across the North of Ireland and, indeed, across the island of Ireland.  Victoria Square  has regenerated a large area of Belfast  city centre and provided an iconic building that attracts local, national and  international interest. I regard that urban regeneration project as a success,  socially and commercially.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Shared spaces are only part of the work of a shared future.  The progression of a shared future for all must be at the forefront of all our  agendas. If we fail to build an inclusive future, we will jeopardise the  opportunity that we have to secure lasting peace, sustainable communities and  economic prosperity for all our people. I believe strongly that we need a  strategic approach to the issue across government, across the Assembly and  across civic society as an immediate priority.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Small Pockets of Deprivation Programme</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">2. <strong>Mr  Beggs </strong>asked the Minister for Social Development for an update on future  funding for the small pockets of deprivation programme. (AQO 1078/10<a name="AQO1078/10" id="AQO1078/10"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: In December 2009, I approved a further extension to the  small pockets of deprivation (SPOD) programme. I committed &pound;415,000 in this  financial year for the schemes that are receiving support already from the SPOD  programme. That involves supporting the running costs for community centres and  salaries for staff who are employed using programme funds to deliver services  at a local level. SPODs have been approved in 17 housing estates across Northern Ireland, including in Larne, Sunnylands  in Carrickfergus and Greenisland, all of which are in the Member&rsquo;s constituency  of East Antrim.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  Will the Minister acknowledge that the small pockets of deprivation programme  was introduced as a result of the adverse findings of the equality impact  assessment carried out in the community regeneration programme? Will she ensure  that continuing support is given to the programme? She said that the programme  provides salaries. Many of those small communities do not even have &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member must come to a question.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  They do not even have full-time workers, so will she ensure that funds will be  made available to assist the communities in Larne, Carrickfergus and Newtownabbey?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: The SPOD programme is an extension of the neighbourhood  renewal programme. It was established to deal with certain pockets of  deprivation that were outside the 10% of the most disadvantaged areas in Northern  Ireland that were eligible for neighbourhood renewal funding. The SPOD  programme is a further means of assistance.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Two groups in the East Antrim  constituency are eligible to apply for SPOD funding: the Carrickfergus  Community Forum and Bawnmore and District Residents&rsquo; Association. The Housing  Executive, on behalf of DSD, has met representatives of the Carrickfergus  group, which, I understand, could have submitted its application by now. The  group is likely to be awarded salary and running costs. A meeting took place  with the Bawnmore group on 15 March 2010, and it is being assisted with the  preparation of an application for running costs only.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Community groups in receipt of SPOD funding in the Larne  area make their applications through Larne Borough Council, and, on receipt of  formal applications, decisions are taken on the funding to be awarded to each  group. The Member will be aware that the urban regeneration side of our  programme is restricted, owing to the budgetary constraints under which we  operate. However, I will take on board what the Member said and look at the  SPOD programme to see how it may be of further benefit to his area.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I know from the good work that is done in SPOD areas in my constituency, such  as the Glen and West Winds estates in Newtownards, that, welcome as the  extension of funding for this year is to the people working in those estates,  it is the certainty not the quantum of funding that is more important. Does the  Minister agree that extending programmes year on year is less favourable than  having more certainty around a programme&rsquo;s continuance for two, three, four or  more years?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I will deal with Mr Hamilton&rsquo;s point and then discuss  Newtownards. I am sure that the Member agrees with me that it would be great if  I had certainty when it comes to the budget for all aspects of my programme. No  doubt he will be happy to lobby his colleague the Minister of Finance and  Personnel to ensure certainty around the budget for urban regeneration as well  as those for housing and the community and voluntary sector. That is an  important political point. I must be given certainty that the programme for  tackling disadvantage and deprivation will continue. After all, my Department  is responsible for tackling deprivation and protecting the vulnerable.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member will recall that we, along with Mr Shannon,  visited the various areas that he wants to see designated SPOD areas. At his  request, I had an opportunity to meet some of the groups that are doing extremely  good work on behalf of civic society to bring people together and tackle  deprivation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Three areas in Newtownards receive support from the SPOD  programme. Applications have been received from the Glen, West Winds and  Bowtown estates. Those applications have been assessed, and letters of offer  have been issued to meet the amounts claimed to cover their running costs and  salaries, which is approximately &pound;73,000 for this financial year.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I remind Members that, if they wish to ask a supplementary question, they must  continually rise in their place. I have to repeat that request almost every  Monday and Tuesday during Question Time.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  Sorry about that, Mr Speaker.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister summarise how the 2009-2010 budget for  neighbourhood renewal has been expended?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: In 2007, I was able to secure &pound;60 million of revenue  funding for the neighbourhood renewal investment fund for 2008-09 to 2010-11.  In each year during the current comprehensive spending review period, including  2009-2010, &pound;20 million has been allocated to neighbourhood renewal areas. The  funds are allocated per capita across the 36 neighbourhood renewal areas to  help address the needs of 280,000 people in 100,000 households in the most  deprived areas of Northern    Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In 2009-2010, &pound;20 million was allocated to support more  than 300 projects designed to address the underlying causes of poverty and  disadvantage. The projects delivered services that were designed to address  identified needs for employment and training, education and skills, health, and  crime prevention and community safety. They also helped to improve the local  environment and to develop communities&rsquo; confidence and capacity to contribute  to improving the quality of life in their area. The services supported were  identified as priorities in neighbourhood renewal action plans, which  communities drew up in partnership with local government and statutory  agencies. The most important point is that that was done in consultation with  local residents.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Public Realm Projects</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">3. <strong>Mr W  Clarke </strong>asked the Minister for Social Development what budget is available  to her to complete public realm commitments. (AQO 1079/10<a name="AQO1079/10" id="AQO1079/10"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: In 2009-2010, my Department spent over &pound;22 million on  public realm projects. That included &pound;11&middot;4 million on schemes in Belfast, &pound;5&middot;9 million on the Waterloo Place scheme in Derry and &pound;4&middot;8  million on various schemes in the regional towns of Armagh,  Lurgan and Portadown. A budget allocation of &pound;18&middot;3 million is required for  2010-11 to complete existing projects, and the availability of that budget will  depend on the reallocation of urban regeneration funds earmarked for the Royal  Exchange project, which has slipped back. At the time of the previous  comprehensive spending review, the urban regeneration capital budget was fully  allocated to the Royal Exchange project to cover an anticipated &pound;110 million  debtor position. As the Royal Exchange project has now slipped into future  years, the intention is to place bids in the June in-year monitoring round to  reinstate the funding that is required for other key regeneration projects,  including public realm commitments.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr W Clarke</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for her response.  It is widely recognised that public realm schemes enhance business  opportunities, particularly for small businesses. However, there can be a  negative impact on small businesses during the construction phase of such schemes.  In Kilkeel, in the Minister&rsquo;s constituency of South Down, I have had complaints  about businesses losing up to 80% of their business. Will the Minister assure  the House that everything will be done to minimise the impact on small  businesses during the construction phase of public realm schemes?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I will deal with that question in two parts. I have  been addressing the issue in Kilkeel, and yesterday, at my request, my  officials attended a meeting at Newry and Mourne District Council. At my  insistence and instruction, my officials will meet the retailers from Newry Street,  Kilkeel. However, the current work in that area is being carried out by  Northern Ireland Water, an agency that is managed and administered by the Member&rsquo;s  colleague Minister Murphy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Clarke is based in Newcastle,  at the foot of the Mournes, which is a beautiful town in which our public realm  schemes have gained many fine prizes. I am sure that he would agree that that  is a fine example of what DSD can do in local communities. On many occasions,  on personal and business visits, I have noticed that Newcastle is booming, with a large range of  local restaurants and shops all doing very good business.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  Will the Minister update me on the current proposals for the regeneration of  Antrim town, particularly in the Church    Street area? Can she tell me whether there is any  news on proposals for Crumlin?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  Reg Empey will look after that.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: Mr Kennedy is enjoying himself today and is in rather  jovial spirits.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The regeneration scheme for Antrim town has been worked up  over the last three years and, since becoming Minister, I have visited the town  on about three occasions to look at the regeneration possibilities. A  consultation is about to commence on the scheme for environmental improvements,  which are technically called public realm schemes. There is an opportunity to  lever in council funding of around &pound;75,000 to &pound;100,000. DRD will also be  contributing. However, there is a risk that the other funding could be lost if  there is inadequate progress in this financial year. I am sure that Mr Kinahan,  wearing his local councillor&rsquo;s hat, will be doing everything to secure that  funding.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will investigate the situation in Crumlin. However, from  memory, I think that its population level is below the 4,500 threshold for  being treated by DSD. I will write to the Member on Crumlin.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her characteristically illuminating and informative  answers to the House. What are the Minister&rsquo;s priorities for urban regeneration  in the year ahead?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I want to complete the important regeneration work all  over Belfast and the ongoing work in Derry, through Ilex, particularly on the new peace  bridge. My priorities also include making progress on a range of regeneration  projects, master plans and public realm improvements in Belfast city centre and town centres across  the North. Those include Waterloo    Place, working with Derry City Council, Streets  Ahead in Belfast and the Andersonstown Road in Belfast. Public realm works are ongoing in  Portadown, Kilkeel, Downpatrick, Dungannon and other regional towns. Investment  in all those projects amounts to a grand total of &pound;19&middot;3 million of contractual  commitments. That represents a major contribution to the local economy and to  keeping people in jobs, which is the very issue that exercises people  throughout Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Question 4 has been withdrawn, and the Member is not in his place to ask  question 5.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Town Centre Regeneration</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">6. <strong>Mr P J  Bradley </strong>asked the Minister for Social Development to outline progress in  relation to the regeneration and environmental improvement work currently being  carried out by her Department in town centres. (AQO 1082/10<a name="AQO1082/10" id="AQO1082/10"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: In the past year, despite the difficult economic  climate and increasing pressures on public budgets, my Department has made  significant progress in its efforts to regenerate town centres. Since the start  of 2009, my Department has published town centre master plans for Omagh,  Ballymena, Ballycastle and Armagh. Master  plans for a further 16 towns are in progress and will be published before the  end of 2010. My Department has been highly successful in delivering public  realm and environmental improvement schemes in town centres. Over the past  year, 10 such projects have been completed, including the major award-winning  schemes in Newcastle and Armagh  and smaller projects in towns such as Warrenpoint, Cookstown, Ballymoney,  Antrim and Randalstown. Also, despite the downturn in the property and  construction sectors, we have made progress on forming partnerships with the  private sector to redevelop derelict sites in Bangor, Holywood and Portadown.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P J Bradley</strong>:  My supplementary question is one that Mr Clarke could, perhaps, have asked.  Will the Minister detail the regeneration work that is ongoing in or planned  for South Down?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank the Member for asking such a positive question.  I am pleased to inform him that we are doing a great deal of work in South  Down, including in Newry, part of which is located in South Down. In 2007, my  Department purchased the site of the former North Street flats, which is close to the  centre of Newry, and we aim to bring forward a development there that will  benefit the city. Work to prepare concept designs for proposed public realm  improvements at Hill Street  and Monaghan Street  in the city centre is nearing completion. In the past few weeks, we engaged the  Paul Hogarth Company, a firm of specialist planning consultants, to prepare a  master plan for Newry city centre. In Warrenpoint town centre, we completed a  public realm scheme in Queen    Street at a cost of &pound;500,000.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Later this year, work will start on regeneration strategies  for the south Down coastal towns of Warrenpoint, Kilkeel and Newcastle. Those strategies will help to  guide the Department on what further regeneration work is required in those  towns. We have committed &pound;1&middot;3 million to the cost of a significant  environmental improvement scheme in the centre of Kilkeel, which will cost a  total of just under &pound;1&middot;45 million. That scheme has been designed to make the  town centre a neutral environment with open space that is, importantly,  welcoming to all. A contractor has been appointed, and work is starting. In the  past year, we completed a major public realm scheme along Main Street in Newcastle. That scheme, which complements the  work undertaken by Down District Council on the seafront, has won awards for  its high-quality design and excellent environmental standards.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have also committed &pound;2&middot;6 million to a significant  environmental improvement scheme in the centre of Downpatrick, the total cost  of which will be just over &pound;2&middot;95 million. The scheme has been designed to  enhance the reputation of Downpatrick as an attractive visitor destination that  is closely allied with St Patrick as the place where he began and ended his  ministry. The scheme will also ensure that Downpatrick becomes not only an  attractive visitor destination but a place that is welcoming to the local  community and visitors alike. A contractor has been appointed, and work will  start in the town centre very shortly. I anticipate that the scheme will be  completed during 2011. Public consultation on the Downpatrick master plan ended  on 19 March 2010, and I anticipate that the final master plan will be published  by the start of the summer. We are doing a lot, but we have much still to do.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Robinson</strong>:  Is there a regeneration scheme planned for the centre of Limavady?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I take the Member&rsquo;s question on board. On various  occasions, he and my colleague Mr Dallat have invited me to visit Limavady. I  have found it to be a thriving local economy. I will look at the area and come  back to the Member and to Mr Dallat, who has also raised the issue with me.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am sure that the Member will also lobby his colleague the  Minister of Finance and Personnel to ensure that I receive additional funds to  promote and pump-prime not only the public realm but urban regeneration in  towns and cities in Northern    Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>: It  was good to hear the Minister mention every town in Northern Ireland before she  mentioned north Down, but she got there in the end. Will she provide an update  on the progress made with urban regeneration in Bangor?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: The Member will recall that I visited Bangor just before Christmas to deal with the  master plan for the area and with the development at Queen&rsquo;s Parade, which has  the support of North Down Borough Council. That is a tremendous opportunity to  transform that area and ensure that Bangor will  be able to compete as a tourist destination with the other coastal towns in County Down.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A master plan is being prepared for Bangor, and I will write to the Member and  tell him what stage it has reached. The development of the master plan will be  an opportunity for all Assembly Members and councillors for the north Down area  to define the development opportunities for their town for the next 20 to 25  years. Therefore, I ask them to seize that opportunity.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Social Housing: Mid Ulster</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">7. <strong>Mrs  O&rsquo;Neill </strong>asked the Minister for Social Development how many units of social  housing were completed in the Mid Ulster constituency in each of the last three  years. (AQO 1083/10<a name="AQO1083/10" id="AQO1083/10"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I am pleased to report that, despite the very well  documented problems with my budget, we have just started building 1,838 houses,  which is the largest number of new homes for over a decade. Those homes have  been delivered to people in housing need across the North of Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member understandably has a specific interest in Mid  Ulster. I am happy to say that in the three years up to March this year we  delivered 69 new homes at a cost of &pound;5&middot;7 million. We have plans for more homes  in the area, which is something that my colleague Mr McGlone has been  constantly asking me about. We have schemes planned for 2010-11, covering  Cookstown and Magherafelt, and for 2011-12, covering Coalisland, Knockcloghrim,  Moneymore, Draperstown and Cookstown. That is significant work.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Of course, our social housing development programme is just  one way that we meet housing need in any given location or constituency. The  reletting of existing homes in the public sector is another way in which we can  help to put more people into houses. We also know that more people are turning  to the private rented sector to address their housing needs, and our new  strategy, &lsquo;Building Solid Foundations&rsquo;, will offer some help and support to  those who choose the private rented sector as their tenure of choice.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Maskey</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. When P J Bradley asked question 6 about  improvement work in town centres, it was clear that the Minister read out a  scripted speech about her own constituency that did not even relate to the  question. Given purdah and the upcoming election on 6 May, it is very clear  that the Minister used the opportunity for electioneering purposes. That is out  of order. Will you make a ruling on that? <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. P J Bradley asked a very detailed question that the Minister responded  to. All parties are normally allowed to ask supplementary questions, and I am  sure that Members to my left could have asked a supplementary question to the  Minister for Social Development. That did not happen. Moreover, I am conscious  that minds are somewhere else, maybe not in the Chamber, and that Ministers may  take the opportunity to say something. As far as I am concerned, P J Bradley  asked a detailed question and the Minister felt that she needed to give a detailed  answer. As you know, the Committee on Procedures has looked at the issue of  Ministers giving long-winded answers to questions, and, come September,  Ministers will have two minutes to answer the original question and one minute  to answer a supplementary question.</p>
    <p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="6"></a>Executive Committee Business</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Revised Programme of Expenditure 2010-11</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Debate resumed on motion:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That this Assembly approves the revised programme of  expenditure proposals for 2010-11 as set out in the Budget laid before the  Assembly on 13 April 2010. &mdash; [The Minister of Finance and Personnel (Mr S  Wilson).]</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel (Mr S Wilson)</strong>: I assure the House that I will not  make any announcements about East Antrim  during my winding-up speech on the Budget motion. I thank Members for the  instructive debate, in which opposing views have been put forward. It is  important that the Budget is dedicated to making Northern Ireland a better place for  our people. Many of the issues have been aired during previous discussions,  and, to a certain extent, the debate has covered old ground.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">One recurrent theme was raised by the Chairperson of the  Committee for Finance and Personnel and by a number of other Members including  Mr Hamilton, Mr Storey, Mr Wells and Mr Kennedy. They said that the Budget  debate has been curtailed by the absence of detailed information from a number  of Departments to Committees, which, rightly, wanted to see how Ministers  wished to implement any changes to the budgets in their Departments. I sought,  as early as 7 January and on a number of occasions since, to encourage  Ministers to provide the information that Committees need to scrutinise  Ministers&rsquo; decisions because, at the end of the day, although we agree the  global sums in the Budget, it is up to Ministers to implement it in their  Departments and to give the details to Committees.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In light of that, the Chairperson of the Finance Committee  raised the issue of the process for future Budgets and the review of the Budget  process. I regret that that has not happened more quickly, but other urgent  work needed to be done. The Assembly would have agreed that the urgent work to  revise this year&rsquo;s Budget was much more important than finalising the report on  the Budget process. That has been completed only recently, but it will be sent  to the Committee immediately, or shortly after, today&rsquo;s debate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that the new process will lead to earlier engagement  by all Departments with Committees and the wider public, so that there will be  an opportunity for Committees, at least, to give greater emphasis to realistic  alternatives to the approach being proposed by the Executive.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Hamilton talked about the social development budget and  the fact that there was a lack of information. However, the budget allocated to  the Department for Social Development will mean that &pound;160 million will be  available, which will provide for 2,000 new starts in 2010-11. That will be  welcomed by the construction industry and those on housing waiting lists. It  represents a 4&middot;7% increase on the 2009-2010 position, and despite some  complaints made in the past, this Assembly&rsquo;s record on building social houses  has been exemplary. On top of that, there is &pound;15 million extra available for  people on low incomes to &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  I agree with the Minister that the Executive have provided large amounts of  money throughout this term to build social housing. However, there is another  side to the story, and it involves maintenance and replacements. Funding moved  from that side has a dire impact on the construction industry.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: A balance has to be struck between maintaining the  current stock and building new houses. The current Minister&rsquo;s emphasis seems to  be on building new houses. The target in the new social house building  programme this year was exceeded. Had it been stuck to, perhaps there may well  have been some more money for maintenance.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McNarry is a great one for coming in here, making a  speech, walking out again, and never bothering to return. That is why he  continually makes mistakes. He is never here to learn. He asks questions, looks  puzzled and says that he wants serious questions answered; but he never gets to  hear the answers. So, he asks the same wrong questions next time. He seemed to  have some great concern about the budgetary process, that urgent procedures  were used, and he questioned whether the Budget was legal.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The process by which the Budget was decided by the  Executive is legal: that is the first thing to say, and it is not waffle. Mr  McNarry also accused me of waffle in other things. Let us get to the facts of  the case. First, the draft Budget and changes required were brought to the  Executive in September 2009, which left plenty of time for consideration. The  proposals were debated by the Assembly and were agreed unanimously. The changes  to the draft Budget were taken to Ministers on 19 March 2010, for discussion at  the Executive on 25 March 2010. There was no disagreement. The Health Minister  raised a point about swine flu, but Mr McNarry&rsquo;s party put in a nil return to  the proposals.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At one point, there was an issue about water, which meant  that the Budget had to come back, but that was resolved. I think that the  Assembly would have criticised me had we started the year without giving  Ministers some certainty about the budgetary position. For that reason, and  because there had been discussions in the Assembly, that Ministers had been  presented with the final proposals, the fact that there were nil returns on  those final proposals, and that there was only a small area of disagreement  that was quickly resolved, I think that it was fairly safe to go down the route  of accelerated passage. We would have been criticised for entering the year  without the Budget agreed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Farry asked a question about the Budget. The changes to  the Budget were insignificant. The changes made between what the Assembly and  Executive Ministers knew from the beginning of January and what was finally  presented were minimal.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Instead of deferring full consideration of the Northern  Ireland Water bid until the June monitoring round as normal, that was done and  the relevant figure changed. Therefore, we will not consider that in June; it  has been done now. When the Assembly discussed the invest to save proposals in  February, &pound;26 million had not been allocated, but now it has, so there is &pound;26  million of a change across the budgets as a result of those allocations being  made. There were also some technical changes, but those are all the changes  that were made. Therefore, by and large, there has been a discussion and an  agreement on this Budget.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr O&rsquo;Loan started his speech by saying that he could not  agree the revised programme of expenditure proposals and would probably be  dividing the House. I have made the point that he did not divide the House on  this in February. There is no significant change in the Budget, and I suspect  that the only difference between now and February is that there is an election  in a couple of weeks&rsquo; time. So, Mr McNarry, sorry, Mr O&rsquo;Loan, being ever the  opportunist &mdash; of course, Mr McNarry is an opportunist as well &mdash; has decided  that he will divide the House on a Budget that is basically the same as one  about which he had no concerns, or not enough to divide the House, a month and  a half ago. He has the right to do that if he wants to, but he must explain  that inconsistency.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr O&rsquo;Loan also raised the issue &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I will. Since I mentioned the Member, I should give  way.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  presume that the Minister accepts that there is some significance to this  substantial document &lsquo;Revised 2010-11 Spending Plans for NI Departments&rsquo;. It is  that document and the related proposal that have come to the Assembly today for  the first time. At this formal stage, it is entirely appropriate for my party  to take a view, and our view is that we do not accept it because of the  significant cuts in previously determined spending lines.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I do not want to labour the point, but most of the  figures &mdash; in fact, 99&middot;9% of the figures in the final version of the document to  which he referred &mdash; have been available and have been discussed in the Assembly  and by Committees over the past two and a half months. The only changes are  those that I listed in response to Mr Farry&rsquo;s question, namely the change in  the Department for Regional Development and the allocation of the invest to  save funding. I would have thought that, if there were fundamental  difficulties, we would have had a Division before now. However, as I said, it  is the Member&rsquo;s right and if he wishes to call a Division, that is fine, but  people will see it for what it is: a cheap way to distance himself from the  kind of decisions that must be made.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr O&rsquo;Loan also asked what preparations had been made in respect  of the slowdown in spending for 2011-12. First, we do not fully know what the  situation will be; we are feeling our way in the dark, and the 2010 UK Budget  did not really give us much of an indication. However, we know that current  spending is not likely to go up at all and that there may well be a reduction  of up to 10% in capital spending. I have already told Departments that they  should prepare for that; it should not come as a shock to them and they should  be looking now at their spending plans in light of the available information.  The invest to save programme was designed to help Departments deal with some of  those concerns.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I think that I have dealt with Mr O&rsquo;Loan&rsquo;s concerns about  the Budget. His concerns do not seem to be shared by his party leader, who  offered no comment on the recommendations before us. Perhaps the Member needs  to talk to her, and a wee bit more communication in the SDLP might be helpful.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have dealt with Mr Farry&rsquo;s point about how the figures  changed. I hope that he is clear on that. As always, he raised the issue of the  cost of division. I have answered that question before. Of course, he can now  ask his own Minister, because one of the areas in which the cost of division is  most apparent will be under the responsibility of the Department of Justice. It  will be interesting to see what his party does now.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My one hope, though, is that Mr Farry will not become an  Establishment figure. I have always enjoyed the debates and his independence.  He is, perhaps, my kindred spirit on this type of topic. He is always prepared  to raise his head above the parapet. I hope that he is not now firmly pulled  below the parapet because his party is part of the Establishment. I hope that  he will continue to have that independence, which at least leads to some lively  debate in the Assembly.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">He also raised the issue of corporation tax. He unfairly  accused me of doing a 360 degree turn on corporation tax. He accused me of  doing twice as much as Mr McNarry did: he accused me of doing a 180 degree  turn. Now Mr Farry has me turning round in circles on the issue. The position  that I adopted has been consistent. If the result of a reduction in corporation  tax is that the block grant is hit immediately, which is bound to have an  impact on spending in Northern    Ireland and on the move towards a recovery,  it is not a price worth paying. That is not inconsistent with my party&rsquo;s  position. We said that if we had leverage, we would seek to negotiate the  advantage that a reduction in corporation tax would bring without the cost  being attached. That may or may not be achievable, but it is entirely  consistent with the reservations that I raised in that regard.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Boylan raised the question of redundancies in  non-governmental organisations. I have always said that it is far better to be  honest: in a period of constrained expenditure, and given the amount of  expenditure that goes on manpower and employment in Departments and  organisations that rely on public spending, we cannot avoid job losses. They  are inevitable.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I see that my time is nearly up. I thank Members for the  part that they played in the debate today. Although we have spending plans  before us, funding has been tight. I hope that the Assembly will endorse the  Budget.</p>

    <p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="7"></a>Committee Business</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Get on Board Programme</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The next item of business is the Committee for Employment and Learning motion  on the Get on Board programme. The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to  one hour 30 minutes for the debate. The proposer of the motion will have 10  minutes in which to propose and 10 minutes in which to make a winding-up  speech. All other Members who are called to speak will have five minutes. I ask  Members who are leaving the Chamber to do so in an orderly fashion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Employment and Learning (Mrs D Kelly)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That this Assembly commends the Minister for  Employment and Learning for providing funding for the Get on Board programme,  which aims to increase and diversify participation in and access to public  appointments; calls on the Minister to ask all Departments with responsibility  for the delivery of the public appointments process to nominate a specific  contact to engage with the programme&rsquo;s delivery; and further calls on the  Minister to request that his Executive colleagues arrange with their  non-departmental public bodies and agencies for programme participants to be  able to attend meetings to gain a greater insight into their workings.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am pleased to speak as Chairperson of the Committee for  Employment and Learning and to bring this important motion to the Floor.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to pay tribute to the previous Committee  Chairperson, Ms Sue Ramsey, who ensured that the motion was tabled. Members  understand that the issue of public appointments is one that does not sit  within a single departmental remit but goes to the heart of two issues that  every Member should care passionately about: social inclusion and widening  participation. Both of those principles are key parts of the current Programme  for Government, and the Committee uses them as touchstones for many of the  issues that it deals with. I want Members to think about those issues in their  Committees and how they apply to their stakeholder groups. The Employment and  Learning Committee&rsquo;s purposes today are to highlight the issue of opening up  public appointments so that they better reflect the diversity of our community,  and to call for action.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Molloy] in the Chair)</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I understand that the Minister for Employment and Learning  will be responding today, and I hope that he will be able to attend as  scheduled. I reassure the Minister that the Committee clearly understands that  the issue of public appointments falls primarily to the Office of the First  Minister and deputy First Minister. However, the Minister for Employment and  Learning has provided resources for the development and roll-out of the Get on  Board programme, for which he is to be commended. The Committee&rsquo;s stakeholders  urged it to bring this issue to the Chamber.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee seeks the Minister&rsquo;s assistance as an  advocate within the Executive for the Get on Board programme. It wants him to  encourage his Executive colleagues and their Departments, agencies and bodies  to engage with the programme and improve access for everyone to public  appointments.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Get on Board programme was developed by the Department  for Employment and Learning and Belfast   Metropolitan College  in response to criticisms of, and recommendations regarding, the public  appointments process made by Baroness Fritchie, the Commissioner for Public  Appointments at the time. She recommended the development of a short course  designed to help people learn the skills needed for public appointments. The  ultimate aim of the Get on Board course is to widen participation in public  bodies. The current commissioner, Felicity Houston, is a strong advocate of the  merits of the programme. The programme was piloted in March 2006 by Belfast Metropolitan College,  which has continued to run it in subsequent years. The course was mentioned in  the OFMDFM public appointments annual report for 2008-09 as being:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;developed to help improve public accessibility to  public appointments and other public life positions by explaining what board  members actually do and how the appointments process works&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The same annual report went on to highlight the statistics  regarding public appointments with which we are all familiar: too few women,  younger people, people with disabilities and people from ethnic and other  minority groups. That means, in effect, that there are too many white, middle  aged, middle class men.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Get on Board programme seeks to deal with key barriers  to the public appointments system as identified in a 2005 report from the  Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments here. Those barriers are: a  lack of awareness of public appointments; the unattractiveness of public  appointments; a lack of confidence to apply for public appointments; the  commitment associated with public appointments; and remuneration.  Recommendation 6 of the report was that:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;departments explore ways to make it easier for  potential applicants to understand and meet the commitments associated with a  public appointment.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That is what the Get on Board programme is all about. A DEL  evaluation of the programme in June 2008 indicated that it had a number of  positive achievements, including: the attraction of people hitherto not engaged  in public bodies; the possible increased participation of women; high  completion and qualification attainment rates; high satisfaction with the  course; and evidence of post-course progression. There was a suggestion in the  report that further work needed to be done to engage some excluded groups in  the programme, such as the unemployed, the poorly-qualified and people in  lower-status jobs. The Committee believes that efforts can be made with  stakeholder groups to increase participation in the course and the public  appointments process by those groups.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I said, the Committee commends the Minister for providing  funding for the development, running and further roll-out of the Get on Board  programme. That important course focuses on preparing people for the daunting  application process for public appointments and gives participants a clear  insight into the nature and function of those offices. The Committee is keen to  ensure that all its stakeholders have access to those roles, and other Members  will want the same for their Committee stakeholder groups.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee advocates that other Committees engage with their  stakeholders as we have and encourage them to seek public appointments. The Get  on Board programme provides an ideal vehicle for the achievement of that aim.  We want greater diversity among those who make up public bodies and who  influence public policy; we want to give a voice to those who are seldom heard.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Cost is a particular problem for the Committee&rsquo;s  stakeholders in accessing the Get on Board programme: the tuition fee for the  programme is &pound;140. As the course is accredited, there is an exam, for which the  fee is &pound;24, making a total of &pound;164. The Scottish Government offer a one-day,  public appointments, non-accredited workshop that is free of charge, and the  Welsh Government offer a similar two-day course. The Committee recognises that  Get on Board is much longer and is accredited, but surely there is scope to  offer that course free of charge to users, considering its potential impact on  social inclusion and widening participation in society.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Some of the Committee&rsquo;s stakeholder groups said that it would  be useful to have the course available to them locally. The Committee is aware  that the South West  College, the South  Eastern Regional  College and the North West Regional   College have worked with  Belfast Metropolitan College (BMC) to look at providing the course  collaboratively. Advertisements for the course were run in local papers to  ascertain where the greatest demand for it was, as that would determine which  college campuses would offer it. However, at present, the Committee does not  know which, if any, colleges will actually run the course. It is still being  advertised on the BMC website; however, the Committee understands that no one  is available to run the course at that college.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The situation is such that the Committee believes that it  is time for the Minister and his Executive colleagues to step in, put the  course on a firm footing, roll it out geographically, and actively promote it  through Members and Committees engaging with their stakeholders and through  targeted advertising. Departments and their agencies and bodies must engage  with the course, and boards must be accessible to those who wish to sit on  them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee asks the Minister to make the Get on Board  programme known to his Executive colleagues, and it suggests that he ask them to  get their officials to engage with the Commissioner for Public Appointments so  that they might have a clear understanding of the deficiencies of the public  appointments process and the requirements for making the process and its  outcomes more inclusive and more representative of all groups. I ask all  Members present to engage with Ministers through their Committees and to ask  them how they intend to address the under-representation of the groups listed  earlier.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I welcome the opportunity to speak  on the motion, and I commend the Committee for Employment and Learning for  having the foresight to bring it to the Assembly. I also want to thank the  Chairperson for her kind words, and, if I can be of any assistance to her in  her new role, she should feel free to call on me. We already have a good  working relationship in the Committee, and I hope that that will continue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion came about after I met Eileen Mullan from Belfast Metropolitan College.  She expressed her concerns about participation levels for a course on public  appointments and whether people were getting the necessary training for, and  advice on how to get involved in, public appointments. I felt that it was an  issue that Committee members were aware of, had concerns about and would be  interested in, so I asked Ms Mullan to bring the matter to the Committee.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">During that presentation, we were struck by the evidence of  a senior member of the community who had been a firefighter in his time and had  decided to give something back by taking on a public role but who had been  turned down. Statistics show that most of those who hold public appointments  are middle-aged male professionals. It was a concern to us that that  firefighter was a professional, but he still found the application process hard  to get through.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When we talk about public appointment holders being mainly  male and middle aged, one of my colleagues describes them as, &ldquo;male, pale and  stale.&rdquo; I happen to agree with her. That is no reflection on anyone who holds a  public appointment, but we need to change that image and the statistics behind  it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">This Assembly is about change; the Executive are about  change; and we, as elected activists, get involved in political life to bring  about change to our communities and constituencies.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As the Chairperson of the Committee for Employment and  Learning said, the issue of public appointments does not rest with the  Department for Employment and Learning but with all Departments. I commend the  Minister for Employment and Learning and his Department for taking the  initiative and funding the programme. When we have the opportunity to commend,  it is important that we do so. The purpose of the motion is to ask the Minister  to take it one step further and go to his Executive colleagues about the issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">One of the key points of the Programme for Government that  the Chairperson spoke about was social inclusion. If we want to bring about  change for the better, we need to ensure that all Departments take ownership of  public appointments. As I said, social inclusion is a key aspect of the  Programme for Government.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Get on Board programme came about following  recommendations and a call for the development of a short course. Although I  welcome that, I have a genuine concern, because when talking about getting more  women, people with disabilities and young people involved, it must be  recognised that the cost of the course will be a factor. Although we are taking  the step to give people the tools to get involved in public appointments, the  cost is still a barrier to some. It is an added cost that particularly affects  young people, lone parents and women who are in low-paid employment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A Public Accounts Committee report on the hospitality  industry from the 2007-08 session called on OFMDFM to bring forward proposals  to change how public appointments are made. I want the Minister to tell us  whether that has happened, because in October 2007, the then junior Minister Paisley, while commending the Get on Board programme,  said:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;it&rsquo;s important that individuals from a wide range of  backgrounds take up public appointments&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That statement was made by a junior Minister in  OFMDFM; therefore, we need to be aware that that Department is also playing its  part.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Statistics show that a lot of people from certain groups  are still under-represented in public appointments. Although we are providing  resources to try to change those statistics, we must ensure that we are  changing them for the better.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am conscious that I am running out of time. I support the  motion, part of which calls on the Minister for Employment and Learning to  raise the issue with his Executive colleagues. Therefore, I ask that the  Minister provides regular updates about responses from his Executive colleagues  or departmental officials.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Bring your remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  It is important that we send out a clear message to our communities and  constituents that, when they bring concerns to the Assembly, we are listening  and making a difference to their lives.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McClarty</strong>:  I also welcome the debate and agree with the sentiments expressed in the  motion.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Get on Board programme is an excellent course that  seeks to develop transferrable skills to individuals with a view to public  appointments. Diversifying the profile of those being appointed to public  bodies is a sound objective for the Executive. This programme is testament to  the Minister&rsquo;s commitment to that goal.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion calls for agencies and bodies, which are likely  to have Get on Board alumni appointed to them, to open up meetings and enable  programme participants to attend. It is desirable that all such bodies should  have as many meetings as possible open to the public as a matter of course. I  agree that it would be useful for Get on Board participants to have the  opportunity to attend meetings to get a feel for how business is done, for  better or worse. I also feel that public scrutiny of non-departmental public  bodies and agencies should be an objective in itself.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although I support the sentiment of the motion, I feel that  there are broader objectives that can be achieved through an open-door  approach. However, I understand that that cannot be a universal approach.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I look forward to hearing the Minister&rsquo;s reply to the  debate, and I am particularly interested in how his Department has been  assisting in the development of the course. How the course is funded and  assuring value for money for the taxpayer is obviously an imperative in any  such matters.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It must be said that, for Northern Ireland&rsquo;s economy to grow,  we must grow the private sector. Therefore, I hope that the Minister&rsquo;s primary  employment priorities are focused on reducing gradually the proportion of  people in Northern Ireland  who are employed by the state. That said, I welcome the Get on Board programme  for the work that it does in assisting a wider range of people to participate  in the governance of our public bodies. I support the motion, and I  congratulate the Minister on his Department&rsquo;s handling of the programme.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: I  support the motion, although I have reservations about the Get on Board  programme. No doubt the programme has been well attended, but I am not sure  whether I would call it successful. Its main aim is to attract people who have  been under-represented on public bodies, such as women, those with  disabilities, ethnic minorities and those from all walks of life, not just  retired head teachers and accountants. Early indications are that the majority  of people who attend programme courses have degrees and higher-status jobs.  Course representation is also higher among those aged 35 and over. Therefore,  we are attracting more of the same; people who are already on public bodies.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also have reservations about barriers to the course. If  it continues to be run in its current format in further education colleges, it  will not be suitable or appropriate for many people who come from  under-represented groups or communities. First, the cost is too high; &pound;146 is a  lot of money. Secondly, the course is far too long. Including examinations, the  accredited course lasts for 12 weeks, which is unattractive to working people  from a community sector background. Someone mentioned the Scottish model, which  consists of a one-day, non-accredited workshop that is free of charge. The  Welsh Government offer something similar, which lasts two days and is also free  of charge. That is much more appealing to the sort of people whom we want to  attract to public bodies.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, I am concerned that it is not enough to hold  the courses in further education colleges. They should be run concurrently in  community settings, such as women&rsquo;s centres, disability support organisations  and ethnic minority support organisations, not in big institutions into which  many local people do not want to go and which they find to be too formal. I  would like the Minister to think about those points. The cause is good, and I  support diversification and bringing people in to public bodies from all walks  of life. However, we must make the process more accessible.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs McGill</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. As a member of the Committee for  Employment and Learning, I support the motion, and I commend the Minister for  the work that has been done so far. Like other Members who have contributed to  the debate, I encourage the Minister to make progress on the matter.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The subject of public appointments is a big issue,  particularly for those who know little or nothing about the appointment process  or about the power that public bodies have in many situations. Recently, I  learned something about a particular public body.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The body to which I refer is the Council for Nature  Conservation and the Countryside. The reason that I learned a little about that  public body is because of an issue that arose with regard to the designation of  an area of special scientific interest (ASSI) in the Gortin and Greencastle  area of my constituency. That designation was particularly fraught for people  in the area. Parts of local farmers&rsquo; land were to be designated in a way with  which they, perhaps, did not agree. We learned that the Council for Nature Conservation  and the Countryside could advise the Minister on the matter. When we asked to  speak to the council, we met one member; I believe that the chairperson was  unavailable. Although it was a local issue that affected people who lived in  the area, they knew little about the council.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Members mentioned under-representation on certain public  bodies. I have a list of the members of the council, which advises the Minister  of the Environment. The list supports points that have already been made about  under-representation. Of the council&rsquo;s 18 members, 15 are male and only three  are female. The council deals with the countryside, and females also have a  role and a contribution to make. Certainly, widening access and broadening  participation is vital to that. If a course is designed to encourage people to  get on board and learn about public appointments, that certainly helps  communities and society in general.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Members referred to the fees of &pound;164. The Northern Ireland  Rural Women&rsquo;s Network wrote to Belfast   Metropolitan College  about that issue. It made the point well that women, particularly those in  rural areas, are not represented at that level, and fees of &pound;164 certainly  increase barriers to their participation. The Public Accounts Committee said  that action must be taken and access widened. That is supported by earlier  contributions in the debate and by evidence.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Another group that is clearly under-represented is people  with disabilities. I looked at statistics for 2007-08 from OFMDFM&rsquo;s central  appointments unit that relate to people with disabilities. The documentation  gives the figure of 45 with regard to disability, after which it states that  there are no statistics on appointments. I am not sure whether that means that  45 people with disabilities applied but were not, in the final analysis,  appointed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, there is work to be done. The debate will  contribute to that. I support the motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Ramsey</strong>:  I thank the Committee Chairperson for tabling the motion. I welcome the  Minister&rsquo;s attendance at the debate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to address two themes, the first of which relates to  the Get on Board course. The second theme is the appointments system and how  Executive Ministers could act to ensure that the system is promoted to generate  wide public knowledge of appointments and how they operate so that successful  applications come from a wider range of applicants.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clearly, as all members saw in evidence to the Committee,  public bodies do not reflect the make-up of the general population, particularly  in respect of gender, disability, age and ethnicity. That gives rise to  questions about equality, which we are all keen to promote. It also means that  key skills and insights are likely to be unavailable to various boards  throughout Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We must always be mindful that people who are appointed to  public boards take on a great deal of work and responsibility that is over and  above any remuneration that they may receive for their role. They put  themselves in positions in which they can be held accountable for decisions  that they take. It is right that people should be given the necessary support  from government to prepare for possible appointments and to carry out their  duties.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have seen the governance issues that arose with regard  to one of DCAL&rsquo;s arm&rsquo;s-length bodies. I am not going to go into the details,  but the names of the members of those boards were tarnished as a result of the  inactivity of some members. I was a member of the Committee for Culture, Arts  and Leisure at that time, and for months the Committee received various reports  on the Events Company and the difficulties that had occurred. However, good,  decent people were also on those boards, and their names were tarnished.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As we all know, the Get on Board course is a worthy exercise  that is designed to ensure wider access to public appointments. Based on the  limited information that we have and given the timescales and the numbers  involved, I understand that participants on the Get on Board course were  successful in being appointed to various boards, and that is important. It is a  matter of concern that the Get on Board course has been dropped by Belfast Metropolitan College  and has not been taken up by any of the other colleges at present. Perhaps the  Minister could use his influence to address that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The low uptake of the course is part of the reason why it  was dropped. Clearly, more needs to be done to persuade people to undertake the  course, which has been particularly successful in preparing people from  under-represented groups and has allowed them to successfully apply for and  obtain board positions. I urge the Minister to go back to the colleges to see  whether barriers to access, in particular, can be reduced and to ensure that  the courses are promoted so that there is a greater take-up and they can be  rolled out successfully across Northern    Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I now want to talk about the appointments system. Research  suggests that there is a lack of public knowledge about public appointments and  the appointments system. That situation could be changed through better  communications, and all our Ministers and their Departments could make an  important statement and communicate their policy and role in the matter.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is also concern that the various boards across  Departments and their organisations seem to have a range of different methods  of managing the appointments process. The application process is deemed to be  complex, with forms that use terminology that may not be understood by people  outside the immediate organisations. That situation is preventing competent  people from applying successfully, if at all, for board positions. There should  be greater standardisation across the boards&rsquo; application processes, and the  application forms should use language that is better understood outside the  immediate organisations.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In addition to his ensuring the roll-out of the Get on  Board courses, I ask the Minister, as all Members have asked, to bring to his  Executive colleagues and their Departments four points: to ensure higher levels  of public awareness of public appointments; to design greater consistency into  the appointments processes across the Departments; to ensure the reform of the  appointments process; and to take the necessary steps to ensure that there is a  cross section of the community on the boards so that they are reflective of the  community on the basis of equality.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning (Sir Reg Empey)</strong>: I thank the Committee for  proposing the motion. It is clear that there has been a positive response from  the Committee and a number of Members. Initially, I want to address some of the  points that have been made.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I clarify that my Department funds the course as it funds  every other course, and the funded learning unit (FLU) is applicable to this  course as it is applicable to other recognised courses in the college funding.  The colleges determine how much they charge for those courses, not the  Department. As one Member said, some colleges charge &pound;146 and others charge  &pound;39, but those are matters for individual colleges to determine. We fund them  on the same basis as every other course.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The other common dominator from virtually all Members was  that I should draw the matter to the attention of my Executive colleagues. I  have no problem in doing that. I will undertake to do that, and the Department  will keep the Committee informed of the responses that we receive.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">OFMDFM has policy lead with regard to public appointments  generally.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">One possibility might be to offer courses to  applicants on a full cost-recovery basis. That is a matter for that Department,  but I will certainly write to the First Minister and the deputy First Minister  conveying that sentiment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The issue of the development of the course was raised  during the debate. The Department, through a former permanent secretary,  initiated that idea some years ago.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Anna Lo referred to the Scottish and Welsh practice of  offering one- and two-day courses. Although there is nothing wrong with that  type of course, the point that Pat Ramsey made was important. Some of the bodies  that people are appointed to are significant organisations that hand out very  significant amounts of money, and a number of appointees got themselves into  difficulties because they did not fully understand their fiduciary  responsibilities as directors or board members. Given the wide variety of  appointments on offer across the Province &mdash; from voluntary and community bodies  right through to heavy duty public sector organisations through which very  large sums of money are spent &mdash; it is essential that people have a solid  grounding in and understanding of the financial and other responsibilities of  those roles. Therefore, I do not believe that a one- or two-day course is  sufficient to cover the whole remit and spectrum of public appointments. Such  courses would be helpful but not adequate.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: I  have served on several public bodies. After appointment, appointees are sent on  training courses, which are generally only one or two days in length.  Appointees are taught the values and principles of what it means to be on a  body through those training courses, and they learn the remit and  responsibilities of the body as they go along.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: Part of the problem is that the responsibilities  of those serving on boards have grown. Take, for example, the issue of staff  appointments and the need to treat applicants fairly and equally. That is a  huge issue and one that prevents many from applying for appointment to the  boards of public bodies. Mr Ramsey also raised the difficulty of some  appointees being challenged on their financial duties, and a number of  appointees, including those who had come from local government, found  difficulties in that area. It is a question of horses for courses; there is a  very large spectrum in public appointments.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department is looking at the issue from the point of  view of widening access. I will give a sense of where we are with it: 208  people have completed the course, of whom 39 &mdash; 18&middot;75% &mdash;have been successful in  achieving a public appointment. Females accounted for 70% of the participants,  20% were under 40 years old, and 69% came from outside the Belfast area. That is fine up to a point, but  I accept, as Mrs McGill said, that there is more to be done.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My Department has set aside money for the promotion of the  courses, but how that is used is a matter for the colleges. The budget is in  place, and colleges can draw down that money to promote the courses in their  prospectus. It is not essential that courses are conducted in the classroom or  on college campuses. Colleges already run courses all over their respective  areas, in community centres and other locations. When it receives applications,  each college must make a judgement as to where it feels the location of the  course is most appropriate. That decision could be for geographical or other  reasons, but there is no impediment to the courses being delivered outside  college campuses. Further education is already well versed in delivering  courses in the community.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The programme is helping and can help, but it must be  remembered that the burden on individuals who take on public appointments is  growing; let us be clear about that. People are subject to judicial reviews.  Applicants to boards of governors of schools and colleges are doing those jobs  for no financial reward. It is voluntary work, even if they chair those boards.  They have a huge responsibility and make a huge commitment of time.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We are looking at the issue from the perspective of  widening access. The programme is a good thing in any event, and it is part of  the tools that are effective in widening access. We do not have the mix of  people that, ideally, we would like, but we are getting there. We have provided  the tools to the colleges to promote the courses, and, in part, they are doing  that. So far, the resources have not been used up. They are still available for  colleges if they wish to promote the courses.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although the programme is open to all colleges, the courses  are spreading away from Belfast   Metropolitan College.  I understand that, so far, the course has been delivered in Enniskillen,  Londonderry, Cookstown, Belfast  and Ballyclare. All colleges are aware of and are committed to the programme,  but they are at the mercy of people showing interest. I understand that some  interest has been shown in the programme in the Belfast area. There has been interest in  other areas, but it is not yet clear whether those other areas will have  sufficient volume to make the programme worthwhile.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that a qualification emerges at the end  because that will give credibility to the course. The course is not essential,  nor should it be a barrier to applying for a post. I would not say for one  moment that people should not be in a position to have training when they take  up a post &mdash; I would encourage that. However, the course gives people a basic  understanding of their responsibilities, and I certainly undertake to write to  colleagues to encourage them, where it is appropriate, to attend meetings of  various boards, subject to confidentiality issues and other such considerations  that Members will understand. I will do that, and I will be happy to report  back to Members.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The First Minister and deputy First Minister have  responsibility for public appointments in this area, and I will draw the debate  to their attention. As I said, I will be happy to approach them to find out  whether they will consider helping people to pay for the courses. I stress that  my Department is funding the colleges through our normal mechanisms. I do not  believe that it would be appropriate to go further than that at this stage, but  that does not mean that others cannot do so.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Each Department has a designated public appointments  contact, and those officials might be best placed to engage with the Get on  Board programme. I am trying to take on board what Members have said. Although  each Minister is responsible for making public appointments to the boards that  come under the responsibility of their Department, I am happy to support the  Committee&rsquo;s call for Ministers to nominate a specific contact in each  Department to engage with the Get on Board programme. I have no difficulty with  that, and I certainly support it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome any initiative that aims to improve access to  public appointments, and I accept that the current profile is not ideal. The  statistics that I provided earlier show that a high percentage, around 80%, of  the people who have completed the course are women. That is over 160 people,  which is encouraging. A significant number of younger people have done the  course, and both those facts challenge the general assumption about the profile  of the people who sit on boards. I hope that Members feel that that is  positive.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I said, the success rate so far is almost 19%. Given  that the course is comparatively fresh, people often do not succeed on their  first attempt. However, I hope that the experience of doing the course will  give people the necessary confidence to keep applying. If they do not get one  appointment, they should not assume that they will not get another one. I  believe that people having that course under their belt is a positive  development.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Committee for tabling the debate. I am trying  to be as positive as possible in my response. I undertake to keep the Committee  and the House fully informed about the response of my Executive colleagues when  I receive that.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee for Employment and Learning (Mr Weir)</strong>: I thank  the Members who contributed to the debate. I suspect that this is not a  particularly sexy subject and that we will not see it on the front page of the  &lsquo;News Letter&rsquo;, the &lsquo;Belfast Telegraph&rsquo; or &lsquo;The Irish News&rsquo; tomorrow.  Nevertheless, widening access to public appointments is meaty and important,  and that has been reflected in the mature way in which the debate has been  conducted. As a newly appointed member of the Committee, I thank the Committee  and the former Chairperson in particular for bringing this matter forward.  Perhaps I should thank them for dropping me and the new Chairperson in it at  such an early stage.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Widening access is important. This may be a mixed metaphor,  but, if we can provide a ladder to get people up to a level playing field with  those who are already benefiting from public appointments, that is worthy. I  think that it was Pat Ramsey who said that none of this was in any way meant to  denigrate those who have served faithfully on public bodies for many years. In  fact, they have made an outstanding contribution. Widening access and  increasing the pool of people who can join public bodies is good for society as  a whole.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A number of Members, including the Chairperson, referred to  the concern that appointees are mainly male, middle-aged and middle-class or,  as Sue Ramsey said, &ldquo;male, pale and stale&rdquo;. As a 41-year-old Caucasian who  previously worked as barrister, I must speak up for that oppressed minority. In  all seriousness, we must realise that public appointments are for everyone.  Even some of those who fall into the category of male, middle-aged  professionals have felt excluded from public appointments until now. I do not  know whether the firefighter to whom Ms Ramsey referred falls into that category.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to make an important point. Ms Ramsey was right  about that individual. We often focus on groups and stakeholders in society.  However, we must also remember that there are a large number of individuals in  society too. At times, many of them feel intimidated about applying for public  appointments because they believe that it is like the Magic Circle and that if they are not  able to tick particular boxes there is no point in applying in the first place.  As much as this programme is about enabling people to gain qualifications and  giving them opportunities, it is also about breaking down barriers and  perceptions and giving people the confidence to apply for public appointments.  Therefore, it is important that the process is as inclusive as possible.  Indeed, although there is a focus on underrepresented groups, individuals can  make the best use of it. For many people, there is an invisible wall when it  comes to public appointments. They get the forms, if persuaded to do so, and,  after looking at them, they wonder about the point of completing them because  they are not qualified. We must highlight that issue.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The outgoing Committee Chairperson outlined the background  to the issue and talked about the importance of the push that came from the PAC. Members including Sue Ramsey, Pat Ramsey and the  Minister referred to the fact that, although the Committee for Employment and  Learning tabled the motion, it is a multidepartmental issue. Therefore, it is  important that everyone plays their part. It is about ensuring that we do not  have too narrow a focus, and, by the same token, widening access to public  appointments is vital. As a society, the more representative our public bodies  are, the more representative our decision-making will be. This goes beyond DEL, which I appreciate  has been taking the lead on this issue because of the input from the further  education colleges. However, it is a message that should go across the  Executive as a whole.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">David McClarty spoke of the need for diversification, which  everyone would welcome. He also highlighted the importance of funding and value  for money. Although everyone will welcome the programme, we have to ensure that  we get the optimum result for the money that is put in, and the Minister  highlighted some of the success that there has been.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Anna Lo said that there were reservations about the  programme. I suppose that the perception is that many people in public  appointments are drawn from among those with degrees or higher status jobs.  Therefore, we have to make sure that the doors are seen to be open to everyone.  As much as anything, it is about breaking down perceptions. She also  highlighted the Scottish Government and Welsh Government models. Again, there  is a balance to be struck. We have to ensure that whatever is put in place does  not create additional barriers for people.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I was struck by something that the Minister said. If  someone is looking for a public appointment, it will require a major commitment  on their part. However, he said that, at the initial stage, those people may be  put off by having to complete a lengthy course. If we are going to provide  somebody with qualifications, those must be viewed as credible when people go  forward for public appointments. There are weaknesses in a one-day or two-day  course. There is a balance to be struck.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Ms Lo also raised the important issue of flexibility in  respect of locations, and it has been highlighted that the FE colleges have a  reasonably open mind on that. Claire McGill gave a very clear-cut example of  how public appointments can be relevant to a local community. She highlighted  the major problems of a lack of knowledge and information about public  appointments. If someone believes that they cannot apply or they do not know  how to apply, those barriers must be overcome. Pat Ramsey detailed the two key  themes of the scheme itself and the wider issue of public appointments. He made  some concrete suggestions and highlighted the fact that public knowledge lies  at the heart of this issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In his summing up, the Minister indicated that there were  some restrictions on the Department and that, in many ways, fee-setting is  largely in the hands of the colleges. Belfast  Metropolitan College  has carried out some initial projects, and the Minister referred to places  where the programme has been used in other parts of Northern Ireland. If we are to  promote and create diversity in our society, there has to be geographical  diversity so that the programme can be accessed in different parts of Northern Ireland.  We must avoid being seen as Belfast-centric, because such programmes must  permeate Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, the Committee warmly welcomes the initiative  and the good work that has been done. However, as the Minister said, there is  clearly more to be done. We have to build on the programme to ensure that we  get an accessible and financially viable scheme that will, hopefully, widen the  pool of people who can go forward for public appointments. That lies at the  heart of democracy and good decision-making, and it brings things closer to the  community. I commend the motion.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly commends the Minister for Employment and  Learning for providing funding for the Get on Board programme, which aims to  increase and diversify participation in and access to public appointments;  calls on the Minister to ask all Departments with responsibility for the  delivery of the public appointments process to nominate a specific contact to  engage with the programme&rsquo;s delivery; and further calls on the Minister to  request that his Executive colleagues arrange with their non-departmental  public bodies and agencies for programme participants to be able to attend  meetings to gain a greater insight into their workings.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic" style="page-break-before:always;">Motion made:</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That the Assembly do now adjourn. &mdash; <span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; ">[Mr Deputy Speaker.]</span></span></p>
    <p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="8"></a>Adjournment</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Quinn Insurance</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I remind Members that the proposer of the topic will have 15  minutes. All other Members who wish to speak will have approximately six  minutes.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  The Quinn Insurance matter, which has been ongoing for a few weeks, is one that  many believed affected only Fermanagh. However, it is an extremely important  issue not only in Fermanagh but throughout the entire community. I hope to go  into some detail on the wider effect during my deliberations. In the Fermanagh  and South Tyrone area, the impact is widely felt, because Quinn Insurance  employs almost 600 people in Enniskillen alone. We must consider some of the  detail of the issues involved. I hope that the Minister will be able to provide  more up-to-date detail on some of the more delicate matters that pertain to the  issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It came as a huge shock to me and to many of the Quinn  Insurance staff when, on a day in late March, they received an e-mail on their  company computers that told them that the company had gone into administration.  It was interesting to hear how some staff reacted to the news. They were  heartbroken and felt a sense of no longer belonging and not knowing what lay  ahead. The sense of insecurity was hugely difficult for members of staff to  comprehend.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not want to pass judgement on decisions of which I  have no knowledge. However, much is being said about how certain decisions were  made. I do not wish to go into detail on that, but one employee summed it up  extremely well when he said that the decision may have been legally right but  it was commercially wrong. That demonstrated that there may have been a lack of  practicality in the decision-making process. I am also concerned that the  regulator in the Republic of Ireland was able to stop the company trading in the UK. I still  have not received an explanation of how that worked and what involvement, if  any, the Financial Services Authority in the United Kingdom had in that  decision. I do not know whether discussions and co-operation are ongoing  between the regulator in the Republic  of Ireland and the Financial Services  Authority in the UK.  I hope that the decision by Quinn Insurance to enter voluntary administration  will mean that the process can move on more quickly and enable the company to  resume trading in the United    Kingdom. Given the lack of movement in  recent days &mdash; at least I have not heard of any &mdash; it is clear that difficulties  remain.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to concentrate on the human cost. When I talk to  workers from Quinn Insurance in Fermanagh and surrounding areas, it is  difficult to comprehend how serious a matter it is. We hear about three, four,  five and even six members of the same family who work for that company and now  face the prospect of losing their jobs. Sometimes, they even live as part of  the same household. If the company cannot return to trading in the UK, there will  be a huge impact on the economy in Fermanagh and surrounding areas. Not only do  we think about those families, but we think of the businesses that they use &mdash;  the supermarkets and the retail outlets &mdash; all of which will be hugely affected.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Then there is the knock-on effect on other businesses that  are insured with Quinn Insurance Limited. I have been told by businessmen that  they would not be in business had it not been for Quinn Insurance Limited. One  businessman who has a fleet of lorries &mdash; I guess that he has 20 to 25 &mdash; was on  the verge of going out of business, because the cost of insurance was so high.  He was introduced to Quinn Insurance, which helped him to get back into the  market by offering him affordable insurance, and he has remained a customer  ever since. That man told me that he will not be able to trade if Quinn  Insurance Limited is no longer there for him to insure his vehicles and provide  public liability cover and other policies. If he goes out of business, more  jobs will be lost to the area, something that Fermanagh/South Tyrone and the  surrounding areas can ill afford.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am conscious of some of the ongoing behind-the-scenes  issues, but I wonder whether the Minister can give us any update on what  happens now that the company is in voluntary administration. Is there any  prospect of the company getting back into the UK market in the very near future?  That is the only thing that will sustain the jobs in County Fermanagh  and the surrounding areas. The issue is a very serious one, particularly for  those who work for the company, but it is also important to the surrounding  areas and to associated employment.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  I welcome the adjournment debate secured by Tom Elliott on such a crucial  issue. As he rightly said, first and foremost our thoughts have to be with the  employees and their families, who have been caught up in this unfortunate  situation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">More than 600 employees of Quinn Insurance are based at  Enniskillen. In the Chamber today, we have the Minister, whose presence I  acknowledge, and eight other Members. There are fewer than 60,000 people in  Fermanagh, and 600 jobs are under threat. If that were translated to Belfast, which has a  population of more than 400,000, some 4,000 jobs would be under threat. I am  pretty sure that if a debate on that loss were taking place in the Chamber  there would be very few empty seats.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In addition to those 600 employees, there are other jobs,  not least those held by the couple of hundred people who live in Fermanagh and  travel to work at Quinn Insurance in Cavan. Everybody knows about the other  Quinn Group businesses, many of which are located along the Fermanagh/Cavan  border and employ at least another 1,500 people from this side of the border  and probably as many again in the Cavan/Monaghan area.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">No wonder there has been such concern in the west about the  situation and the threat to jobs. People are aware of the massive  demonstrations that took place in Cavan, Dublin  and Enniskillen. Those demonstrations took place against a backdrop of rising  unemployment in the area, which has traditionally depended on construction and  quarrying to deliver jobs.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">We know that the recession has had an adverse  impact on those areas. Furthermore, we all know that it is difficult to attract  investment to Northern    Ireland, especially to the west. I  understand that Invest Northern Ireland&rsquo;s strategy has been to nurture what are  known as indigenous companies. The Quinn businesses fall into that category.  Despite all the difficulties in the west, not least with transport and  peripherality, those businesses have been very successful and have made a significant  contribution to the area&rsquo;s economy over the years. If the threats materialise,  they will undoubtedly cripple the economy in all the border counties in the  west.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">5.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Many meetings have already taken place &mdash; some on this side  of the border and some on the other side of it &mdash; and have been attended by all  of us who represent the constituency. I thank the Minister again for attending  those meetings and for working with Governments and government Departments in  the Republic of Ireland  and in the United Kingdom  to ensure that everything that can possibly be done to safeguard those jobs is  being done.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At this stage, the priority must be to enable Quinn  Insurance to reopen in the United Kingdom  market and to operate new policies and renew existing policies because, since  the matter first came to light, the company has not been allowed to carry out  any business in the UK.  Every day that that situation continues makes the retention of the workforce  less likely. Therefore, that must be our first priority. Given how the Quinn  family has built the business into what it is today, we all want, ideally, it  to still be in charge of the company. However, the company is now in  administration, and we must look at wider possibilities. That is one option. Of  course, it is possible that the company might change hands and come under new  ownership. Those of us who represent the area have been made aware by the  workforce that that is a worrying scenario because of the possibility that a  new owner could relocate, possibly outside &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Bring your remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  &mdash; these islands or even outside Europe. We  must do our best to ensure that, regardless of who the owners are, the jobs  stay in Enniskillen.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  The situation at Quinn Insurance has gripped the imagination and caused concern  not only among public representatives in Fermanagh and South Tyrone but further  afield. Tommy Gallagher&rsquo;s comments about the scale of the potential loss of  jobs are right, and I hope that the word &ldquo;potential&rdquo; is more appropriate than  the word &ldquo;loss&rdquo;. As other Members have said, Quinn Insurance is one the main  employers in the county. Indeed, I suspect that that could be true right across  Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">MLAs&rsquo; comments today might not change the situation much,  but I look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s contribution. I hope that, when she rises  to her feet to address the Assembly this afternoon, she is able to lift the  dark shadow that is hanging over the company at the moment and, indeed, over  the whole of County Fermanagh and further afield.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is not only the future of Quinn Insurance that is at  stake; the Quinn Group impacts and impinges on many other people and companies.  Quinn is a major employer, and many families &mdash; not only County Fermanagh &mdash;  depend on it for their livelihood.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Those of us who attended meetings at Quinn headquarters and  public meetings in Enniskillen saw the depth of feeling that was,  understandably, shown by not only Quinn employees, but by people from other  small companies based throughout County Fermanagh and further afield who are  very interested in the outcome of this affair.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The regulator, rightly or wrongly, took action that made  matters much more difficult. Tom Elliott may be right in saying that such  action may have been necessary, but was it appropriate at this time? Some of us  strongly contend that a bit more thought should have been given to the matter  before such drastic action was taken. All the reports that we have heard, and  we can go on only what we are being told, suggest that the company was in a  sound trading position, and we have to accept that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I trust that as a result of what has happened outside the  House and what is happening in the House today, the message will come across  loud and clear to the powers that be that decisive action needs to be taken,  because every day that the shadow remains across that company, its future, as  well as that of other companies that depend on and are interconnected with the  Quinn Group, is put further in doubt.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I commend the Minister for her hands-on approach. She is,  of course, a County   Fermanagh representative.  However, she is also the Minister, and she has put herself at the disposal of  the company at very short notice to give whatever assistance she can. Those of  us who attended those meetings and saw her work at first hand are singularly  impressed by her action and the concern that she has shown. I have no doubt  that she and her Department will be up for doing whatever is humanly possible.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not want to put too much pressure on the Minister, but  much depends on what she says, and we look forward to her comments. I hope that  she will be able to reassure the House, the Quinn Group and the whole of County Fermanagh  that things will be different, and that there is better news ahead for the Quinn  Group.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McHugh</strong>:  Thank you, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank Tom Elliott for bringing forward the  opportunity to speak on this issue, which is of prime importance to me, as a  representative of that area.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Like the previous Member to speak, I also thank the  Minister for her input from the start and for her willingness to work with Batt  O&rsquo;Keeffe and Brendan Smith from the Government in the South to try to come to  some sort of understanding of the situation and do as much as possible. I know  that the Minister has done an enormous amount behind the scenes. The matter is  made more difficult because the company is not necessarily in either place.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is, perhaps, a tendency for Members who are not in  the Chamber to feel that the company is way down in the west somewhere and is  not that terribly important to up here. However, Quinn Group workers are from  areas from Antrim down to Fermanagh. That includes many private hauliers, from  those who bring oil to the glass factory to those who haul glass from various sites  in Antrim back to that plant, and other divisions of the Quinn Group bring  employees to England  and other places.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is, therefore, a multiplier effect that goes beyond  the 6,000 workers. The workers themselves would, understandably, have been very  shocked by the loss of the insurance division and the fact that it is not  allowed to trade.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is some semblance of hope that Quinn Insurance may be  allowed to trade in some limited way in the UK. The Minister may tell us more  about that. My immediate concern is the impact on the workers &mdash; their fears  over their mortgages and jobs. Many of the Enniskillen workers are kids who  have just left Queen&rsquo;s University. They may be considering starting families  and putting down roots in the area by buying a house. Indeed, their children  would be the ones who would go to school there in the next three or four years.  All that is up in the air because those people have to look elsewhere for their  future.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We in Fermanagh have been in the same position in the past.  We were derailed by the loss of our railways and infrastructure. However, this  time we are being derailed from Dublin  by a regulator who is now coming down hard on all job-producing entrepreneurs,  including Sean Quinn for trying to push forward his business.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Many of the regulatory and banking practices that have been  allowed to operate freely over quite a few years have contributed to the  difficulties and to creating a climate in which people expected to be able to  obtain very large loans. They were asked to take more than they initially  requested &mdash; perhaps double the loan that they wanted &mdash; and that has contributed  to the present situation. If Sean Quinn had looked for a few million, he would  have been asked to take a billion. If someone sought a mortgage, they were  asked to take double the amount, so people now find themselves in negative  equity and in great difficulties because of those practices.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At the time, even the regulators were pressured into  removing legal constraints to how banking and other financial business was  conducted. We heard this morning that the Irish Nationwide Building Society,  which is a mutual, has got into millions of euro of debt by using people&rsquo;s  money. That is just an example of where it all went wrong. The atmosphere that  exists serves as a backdrop to the Quinn Insurance crisis. However, knowing  that does not make it easier on Quinn Insurance workers, and my thoughts are with  them as they attempt to see a future for themselves at this difficult time.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Sean Quinn built up the entire region of Fermanagh that we  are discussing. Who or what will build it up in his place? Apart from the  emigration boat, what was there previously? That was all that the people of the  area ever knew previously. The story is similar in Cavan, Leitrim and a good  part of Tyrone. If Quinn Insurance is allowed to fail, we must think about the  impact that the loss of those jobs will have, because we will never see the  likes of the company again.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Some Members mentioned precedents and whether we here can  help. For example, would it be legal were the Assembly to come up with some  help? Would there be a legal impediment to prevent us from helping? Would such  help come under state aid? Is there precedence? Answers to all those questions  might provide clarity on the matter and help Quinn workers to explore where  they can look to for help. Can Invest NI do anything? I am asking questions so  that we can at least investigate possibilities in the face of the company&rsquo;s  possibly failing in the coming weeks or months.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We want Quinn Insurance to continue and to be able to  trade. Leaving the running of the business with Quinn would have provided a  much better way out of the crisis than we are now looking at, which is the  restriction of the whole operation.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member will bring his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McHugh</strong>: I  will. Thank you.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I speak as a Member for South Antrim but directly as a result of being lobbied by  constituents of mine who depend on their business relationship with Quinn  Insurance.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I congratulate Tom Elliott for securing the Adjournment  debate and for providing Members with an opportunity to comment. I acknowledge  the degree of co-operation by all elected representatives, led at MLA level,  who are working with their colleagues just across the border to make  representations at every level and to provide leadership and guidance to the Quinn  workers in responding to this crisis. That was very positive and encouraging;  it put a focus, quite properly, on job retention and preservation.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">5.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is no dispute that the regulator was obliged to  respond. There is probably nothing of value to the workers in creating a  diversion of that nature. Had a regulator been steadfast in their duties  earlier, it might have prevented some of the financial crisis. In this  instance, however, the regulator responded to the situation as they saw it, and  Sean Quinn has admitted that not everything was perfect in the administration  of the business.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The administrators who were appointed and who have been  made permanent by the High Court act on behalf of the regulator. It may not be  a bad thing that it was the regulator who acted; otherwise the Financial  Services Authority might have felt obliged to act. In that case, the issue  would have become increasingly complicated. I take some encouragement from that  because the nature of the response, the leadership that was given and the  representation that was made has preserved the possibility that the business  can be saved intact and that the administrator&rsquo;s role can be brought to an end  as speedily as possible. That has to be the objective at which we all aim.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Michelle Gildernew is returning from the constituency. This  debate began earlier than was intended, so I hope that she will be here before  it ends. I speak also as Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s spokesperson on the economy. She and I  have discussed this issue on many occasions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It seems that the regulator&rsquo;s concerns, while justifiable,  can be addressed by assurances from both Governments. The type of insurance and  its significance may be beyond the legal powers and the resource capability of  the Assembly; perhaps the Minister will have something to say about that. The  words of the administrator are very strong: the company can be returned to  viability. He believes that many of its divisions are very profitable.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The regulator has made it clear that his issue was with the  reserves. In other words, he was concerned about the solvency of the company,  not its profitability. He has said so on record. The problem is not insoluble.  The united leadership that has been shown is the best hope of preserving the  jobs and the local economy. If we lose jobs &mdash; even initial haemorrhaging &mdash; the  domino effect could collapse the entire edifice. Thousands of jobs could be at  risk and thousands more in the supply side of that vast business empire.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have to approach the issue very cautiously and make  representations to both Governments. They found ways of giving billions of  pounds of public money to the banking institutions. In this instance, that type  of investment may not be necessary; the loan guarantee provision may be  sufficient for the company to trade its way out of crisis. Not only would that  be an elegant solution, it would ensure that Quinn enterprises have a future  and that the sub-regional economy could continue to depend on them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank colleagues who raised this issue for debate. In  particular, I register my appreciation of a high level of co-operation and  common sense from the elected representatives of all parties in showing  leadership in this instance.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>:  Like Mr McLaughlin, I speak as a non-representative of Fermanagh and South  Tyrone, but I have been asked to say something about the issue because of my 40  years in the insurance business before I came here. First, I sympathise with  the employees in the current situation. None of this is their fault, and, when  I heard their initial reactions, which were absolutely natural, I admired their  loyalty and commitment to their company. However, I wondered slightly about  their passionate allegiance to Sean Quinn and the statements that he has been  making, which he has had to temper and change slightly, and I am glad of that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mitchel McLaughlin said that the Irish Financial  Regulator&rsquo;s interference may not be a bad thing, and I completely agree.  Something had to happen. The jungle drums have been beating around Quinn  Insurance on both sides of the border for years, and if the Irish Financial  Regulator had intervened in a sensible way some years ago, the current  situation could probably have been avoided.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am a considerable admirer of Sean Quinn. Anybody who can  build up a business empire in a relatively short time has to be admired, but he  has, perhaps, always held the view that running an insurance company is much  the same as running a quarry, and that is simply not the case. It involves far  more complicated calculations, year on year. Proper reserves and proper  claims-estimating are absolutely vital.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I read with interest some of the comments that came out of  Quinn Insurance in the early stages of this episode. It was said that the group  would achieve cash profits of between &euro;45 million and &euro;50 million in the first  quarter of 2010. It was also said that the group was on target to achieve more  than &euro;20 million in cash profits each subsequent month for the remainder of 2010.  That is crystal ball stuff; it is not insurance.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Quinn Insurance will reach the necessary solvency as  required by the Irish Financial Regulator by the year&rsquo;s end. We could take that  as a positive thing, or as an admission that it was nowhere near financial  solvency when the news broke. The Irish Financial Regulator has, quite rightly,  stepped in. It is the first regulator to have shown some backbone down there.  Perhaps the Irish economy would not be in the mess that it is in if something  similar had been done earlier.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The situation in respect of reserving of claims and  estimation of claims is interesting, because Quinn Insurance has made a big  thing out of its ability to settle claims, particularly third-party ones,  quickly. For instance, if somebody were to suffer an injury as a result of  being struck by a motorist who is insured by Quinn, in very short order, over  the years, somebody from the firm would arrive on their doorstep with a  chequebook and offer to settle the claim. They would achieve a settlement,  write a cheque and get the customer to sign a satisfaction note for full and final  settlement. That greatly upset the legal profession, as I am sure that Alban  Maginness will agree, because they were being kept out of the loop.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On one level, it could be said that that was saving costs.  On another level, Quinn has been trying to stop claims quickly and reduce the  amount to be paid. My understanding is that that is not working any more, and  that a lot of claims are going to be reopened. I am aware of one case that is  ongoing, which involved a very serious back injury some years ago in the  Republic, and the claim was settled for &euro;4,000. That would not even have paid  for the solicitor&rsquo;s costs. That claim has been reopened even though there was a  satisfaction note for full and final settlement. The judge has allowed it to be  reopened, and the current claim is for &euro;250,000 instead of &euro;4,000. Who knows  where that will lead and how many claims and situations will arise when word  gets out that that kind of thing can happen? It has also proved that  satisfaction notes just do not stand up.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Elliott mentioned the FSA in the UK and its  involvement in the Quinn Insurance case. Quinn Insurance is an Irish-regulated  company, which has been allowed to trade in the UK by the FSA because it trusted  the Irish regulator. If the Irish regulator says that the company cannot trade,  the FSA is almost bound to follow its lead. It makes its own decision in the  end, but, in the early stages, it must follow the regulator&rsquo;s lead.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to mention a few names before I sit down. I am old  enough to remember Fire, Auto and Marine; Brandaris; Vehicle and General  Insurance; and, most recently, Independent, which was a top-10 British  insurance company. Independent behaved much in the same way as Quinn Insurance  appears to have behaved. Its behaviour was not picked up by the regulator, and  it went bust in spectacular fashion, costing the jobs of a lot more people than  work for Quinn Insurance. I think that the regulator has made a wise move here.  I hope that the company can be saved. I see no reason why it should not be saved,  but it may have to be under different ownership. I wish it well.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><span class="BoldText">The Deputy Speaker</span>: I call  Alban Maginness.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and  Investment (Mr A Maginness)</strong>: I rise as Chairperson of the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and  Investment. It is important that I emphasise that, because the situation with  Quinn Insurance is not simply some sort of small, local problem. It is a  problem that will have an impact across Northern Ireland and the border  regions. Therefore it is important that the Assembly addresses the issue  carefully in a considered fashion and that it stresses the importance of this  difficult situation to all and for the Northern Ireland economy. I am here  to show the Committee&rsquo;s interest in the situation, to reflect its concern and  to reflect the general concern of Members.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Sean Quinn is a business phenomenon, and his companies have  performed phenomenally. It is important that we register and acknowledge that  and that we congratulate him on the way in which he has contributed  significantly and substantially to the economy of Fermanagh, the border regions  and beyond. Without his entrepreneurial genius, that would never have happened.  There are questions to be asked by the regulator in relation to Quinn Insurance,  and it is right that they be asked. It is also right and proper that a  regulator must act if he or she sees a problem. It is not up to me or my  colleagues to second-guess that decision. That is a decision that he made in  good faith, and we have to accept that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We are in this situation, and we have to work through it in  order to protect the employment of those who are locally employed in  Enniskillen, other parts of Fermanagh and elsewhere. A key to the preservation  of those jobs is the permission that should be given by the regulator to Quinn  Insurance to continue to trade in the UK; that is essential. Without that  permission, the jobs are under serious threat. We must work towards the  objective of getting trading restarted in the UK. The renewal of business in the UK is as  important as taking on new business, because it is natural that people who  cannot renew their insurance will go elsewhere. One cannot trade or drive a car  without current insurance. Time, therefore, is of the essence in that regard. I  am no financial expert, and there are other aspects of the business that need  to be clarified and cleared up, but it is vitally important that this  particular problem be addressed quickly.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">5.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that the Minister, who, together with colleagues  from other parties in Fermanagh and South Tyrone, has done a great deal of work  on the issue, can, through her good offices, exert necessary and legitimate  political pressure to address the situation. I wish her well in that process.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On Thursday, the ETI Committee will receive a deputation of  workers from Quinn Insurance Limited who will have an opportunity to address  the Assembly through the Committee and to make representations. The Committee  looks forward to what they have to say. It is of great importance to us to hear  their concerns and see whether we can assist in the resolution of the  situation. We will assist the Minister and the Department in any way possible,  and, if we can assist on a cross-border basis, all the better, because this  issue transcends the border. It is not necessarily a Northern Ireland or a Southern  problem. It affects both economies and workers on both sides of the border. I  hope that we can make a useful contribution to resolving this problem.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Gallagher referred to the appalling threat of  relocation. Sean Quinn deliberately established his enterprises and businesses  in his own locality. Relocations would be very unfortunate, because Sean Quinn  has put down roots in his own community and county.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I apologise to the proposer of the  adjournment debate, the Minister and my colleagues in the Chamber for missing  most of the debate. I hope that I do not repeat points already made.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">This issue has been of great concern to all elected  representatives and to the broader community in Fermanagh and South Tyrone.  Since the news came through some weeks ago, we have been involved in dozens of  meetings. I was at the meeting in Cavan with the administrator on Easter  Tuesday, and we met the Irish regulator that evening. We met the Quinn workers,  the management and many others in an attempt to make progress and allow the  business to be reopened in the North of Ireland and in Britain and to enable  the people who work in Enniskillen &mdash; more than 500 of them &mdash; to get back to  work.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The workers are extremely concerned about the threat to  their jobs and about their families. On Sunday, I met a woman in Brookeborough  who said that she was the sole breadwinner in the family. She worked for Quinn  enterprises and was very concerned about her job. We hear that right across the  county.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Quinn Group has been very good to the county of Fermanagh.  Without it, we would be looking at an economic wasteland. For generations  people left Fermanagh and Cavan, Leitrim and Sligo, Monaghan and Tyrone to go  to England, America and  other places to seek employment. However, many stayed at home and got well-paid  jobs in their home townlands and villages through the Quinn Group. For that, we  are grateful. We do not want to see the demise of the Quinn Group or of those  jobs. We do not want to see a competitor coming in, buying up Quinn Insurance  Limited and closing down those jobs or moving them to a low-wage economy somewhere  else.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is incumbent on all Members to do what they can, and all  the parties in the North and the South have made a huge effort on the issue. I  attended meetings with people such as Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in TD, Dr Rory O&rsquo;Hanlon  TD, Frank Feighan TD and Seymour Crawford TD. People from right across the  political divide and the island are behind the workers of Quinn Insurance and  their families.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The first meeting that we had was at the Quinn Group  offices in Derrylin on Good Friday. One suggestion that was put to us was that  the Government could underwrite some of the shortfall. I am sure that some  Members here alluded to the fact that Quinn Insurance Ltd needed to have the  money that would cover not only 100% of claims but 150% of claims in accordance  with the regulations in the Twenty-six Counties. Because of the shortfall in  funds and the difference in opinion on how that was calculated, the Quinn Group  found itself in breach of the 150% rule, and it needed an additional surety to  make up the shortfall and begin trading again.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At last week&rsquo;s Executive meeting, I made the point that the  Executive should seek to do everything that they could with the British and  Irish Governments to try to put that surety in place, to try to underwrite the  shortfall in the money and to try to get the business back on its feet and  allow its employees to get back to work. Precedent has already been set. For  example, we have seen the British and Irish Governments bail out the banks, and  we have seen other initiatives to try to move the economic situation on. It is  not outside our remit to press the British and Irish Governments to do  everything that they can.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Quinn Group is not like a big employer in a city. There  is no alternative employment in Fermanagh for the Quinn workers. We need to  maintain the strategic importance of Quinn Insurance as a big employer in a  rural area where we do not have the infrastructure or technology that would  enable us to compete on a level playing field. The Quinn Group has invested in  the infrastructure and in our people, and it has kept jobs in Cavan and  Fermanagh. The strategic importance of the Quinn Group must be fundamental to  the actions that we take. We will continue to get behind the Quinn workers to  press for the business to be reopened to enable that very talented and  motivated workforce in Fermanagh to get back to work providing insurance cover  for many small, rural businesses that, without Quinn&rsquo;s competitive cover, might  find it difficult, if not impossible, to get insurance.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We are all singing from the same hymn sheet today. We are  all behind the Quinn Group, and we need to do everything that we can to ensure  that those jobs remain in Fermanagh.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment (Mrs Foster)</strong>: I want to thank Mr Elliott for securing this  debate. As the Chairperson of the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment indicated,  the matter perhaps merits a full debate. The importance of the issue is shown  by the fact that three Members who are not from Fermanagh and South Tyrone have  attended this debate, and I thank them for taking part.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I listened with interest to the points that various Members  made, and I think that it will be helpful if I begin by outlining the steps  that have been taken to date. I will then move on to talk about our hopes for  the near future &mdash; the very near future, we hope.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As the Minister and, as has been alluded to, as a Member  for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, I have been closely involved in the developing  situation at Quinn Insurance. As has also been alluded to, I have personally  made contact with ministerial colleagues in the Republic of Ireland,  as well as with the appointed joint administrators, Quinn management and  employee groups to give my support and the assistance of the Northern Ireland  Executive. I am committed to doing what I can to assist the company, the  administrator and the Irish Financial Regulator to find a resolution to the  difficult issues in a way that maintains the vital trade and employment that  Quinn provides in Northern    Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Elliott and Ms Gildernew made a point about consumer  choice. If Quinn Insurance was not in Northern Ireland, people would be  unable to avail themselves of insurance at a reasonable price, which is a point  that was made strongly to me by certain sectors. That point has been well made.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Concerns were also raised by the First Minister and deputy  First Minister in a joint letter to the Taoiseach that highlighted that jobs in  both jurisdictions may be in jeopardy. The letter also expressed the  Executive&rsquo;s willingness to work with the Irish Government to expedite a  positive resolution to help to secure the jobs in Northern   Ireland and, indeed, in the border counties of the Republic of Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Members will be aware that Quinn Insurance Limited is a  subsidiary of the Quinn Group, which is a privately owned company with its  headquarters in Derrylin in County   Fermanagh. It is the most  strategic company in that county. I think that it was Mr Gallagher who referred  to the fact that foreign direct investment is not greatly evident in County Fermanagh.  That is absolutely right and is one reason why the indigenous companies in that  county are so important. When we had the rally with the Quinn employees in  Enniskillen, I made the point that a lot of foreign direct investment companies  left in the 1980s and early 1980s, and we were left with people who took up the  reins and continued.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Lunn asked why the employees are so loyal to Sean Quinn  the man. The MLAs for Fermanagh and South Tyrone know the answer to that. The  employees are loyal to Sean Quinn the man because, as Ms Gildernew said, he  provided them with jobs and a reason to stay in County Fermanagh.  He is the reason why it is viable for them to stay in their home county. Had Mr  Lunn been at the rally in Enniskillen, he would not have needed to ask the  question about why the workers are so loyal to Sean Quinn the man and, indeed,  the company.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Quinn Group employs more than 8,000 in the UK and Ireland. It is an important  employer in Northern Ireland  as it provides hugely important employment opportunities in an area that does  not have many such opportunities. Many Members made the point that the Quinn  Group is important not only to Fermanagh and the west but to the whole of Northern Ireland.  Mr McLaughlin and Mr McHugh made the point that its closure would have an  impact on companies far beyond County   Fermanagh. I think that  it was Lord Morrow who made the point that SMEs in and around County Fermanagh  will feel it most keenly if anything of a prohibitive nature were to happen to  Quinn Insurance. That point has been made to all the representatives by a lot  of the small businesses in the county.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Quinn Insurance started operations in Cavan in 1996 as a  provider of general insurance products in the Republic  of Ireland and Northern Ireland.  It most recently expanded its business into the GB market in 2004. In 2003,  with support from Invest NI, Quinn established a contact centre in Enniskillen,  which is one of its seven major contact centres in the UK and Ireland. It employs 557 people on  contracts, though temporary positions increase that figure to more than 600.  The company received financial assistance and grants from Invest Northern Ireland dating  back to 2003. The total financial support has been more than &pound;5&middot;5 million. I  have to say that all but &pound;68,000 of that has been paid out to the company.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Some comments were made about the regulator. I am certainly  not going to second-guess the regulator. I take issue with Mr Lunn&rsquo;s comments  about the projections that were provided by the company. I am not going to  second-guess those projections, which I also take at face value. I am certainly  not going to talk about practices of settlements and so on, because vested  interests always prevail in such circumstances. When we have met representatives  of the company, they have always been very open and clear. That was  demonstrated by the management team that briefed MLAs and TDs three weeks ago  this Friday. Quinn Insurance was very open with us, making the point that  perhaps things should have been done differently and that, with hindsight, it  should have paid more attention to certain areas of the business. However, that  is not to say that the company has not gone about its business in the most  honest way in which it could.</p>

    <p class="B3BodyText">As Members will be aware, on 30 March, the Irish Financial  Regulator made an ex parte application &mdash; an application of which no one else  had notice &mdash; to the High Court in Dublin.  Under the Republic   of Ireland&rsquo;s Insurance  Act, 2000, the court appointed provisional administrators. The answer to Ms  Gildernew&rsquo;s point is that 150% solvency is an issue, and the court papers refer  to the:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;incorrect calculation of solvency and reserves&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Ms Gildernew will also be aware that the papers  mention the &ldquo;non-disclosure&rdquo; of the loan guarantees, which, for the regulator,  seems to be an issue as well, and the &ldquo;systems and controls&rdquo; that allowed the  guarantees to go unreported.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Financial Regulator separately directed &mdash; this is the  key issue for this Administration &mdash; that Quinn Insurance Ltd must cease writing  new business in the UK.  As the Chairperson of the Committee for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment said, that also means that the company cannot renew  business, which is a huge part of its work.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Elliott asked about the FSA&rsquo;s role in the decision to  stop Quinn Insurance writing UK  business. Quinn Insurance Ltd is registered in Cavan, and it operates therefore  under the regulatory guidelines of the Irish Financial Regulator, which has  sole responsibility in the matter. However, the FSA is responsible for the  operation of the branch in Enniskillen, and discussions between the two  regulators to resolve existing issues are ongoing. The Irish regulator is  primarily in charge, and that is why it went to court and took the decision.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  Can the Minister confirm whether the UK regulator is not content with  parts of the operation with which the Irish regulator is content? If so, does  that mean that the UK regulator  can stop the company trading in the UK?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment</strong>: The Irish regulator  alone makes the decision about whether the market reopens, but, obviously, it  will listen to what the FSA in England  says.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Existing UK  policyholders will not be affected by the decision that is on the books, because  all existing policies remain valid. Customers can make claims in the normal  way, but that does not resolve the difficulty in which we find ourselves. As  Lord Morrow said, the situation has cast a dark shadow across the company.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will address a point that was made throughout the debate:  the Irish regulator has full discretion to grant the company permission to  operate in the UK.  I wrote to the UK Financial Services Authority to outline the importance of  Quinn Insurance and, indeed, the Quinn Group to Northern Ireland and to seek  support for the Irish regulator to allow the company to begin writing some  business in the UK again in order to prevent its ongoing decline and potential  job losses.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Of course, every day that passes means lost revenue, which,  we are told, is in the region of &pound;1 million a day. We await the Irish  regulator&rsquo;s announcement, which I hope will happen this week. We will then be  able to see the impact on the company. Members will appreciate that, like the  FSA, the Irish regulator operates wholly independently, and we respect its  position and its independence. However, we want &mdash; this has always been our  desire &mdash; to ensure that the Financial Regulator is in receipt of all the  available information. That is where our efforts have been concentrated. We  have been attempting to let the Irish regulator know about the importance of  Quinn Insurance to the workforce and the local economy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Members will be aware that, since the economic downturn  began, Northern Ireland  has faced immense difficulties. Inevitably, those global forces, particularly  as a result of the banking crisis, have hit businesses both nationally and  regionally. However, it is essential that we do everything that we can to  ensure that Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  burgeoning financial services sector remains a priority. It is a priority  sector for us. We need to work with it. I will continue to work, as, I am sure,  will the rest of the Executive, to reopen the UK market so that Quinn Insurance  in Enniskillen can get back to work and the threat of job losses and closure &mdash;  the dark shadow to which Lord Morrow referred &mdash; can be lifted from the company.</p>
