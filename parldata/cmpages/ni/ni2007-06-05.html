		      First Stage</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr McGimpsey)</strong>: I beg leave to  lay before the Assembly a Bill [NIA 2/07] to amend the Health and Personal  Social Services (Northern Ireland) Order 1972 in relation to the provision of  health care; to amend the Smoking (Northern Ireland) Order 2006 to provide that  in certain circumstances premises may not be smoke-free only in relation to  performers; and for connected purposes.</p>

		    <p class="H4StageHeading">Rural Health Taskforce</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour and 30 minutes for  this debate. The proposer of the motion will have 10 minutes to propose and 10  minutes to wind up. All other Members will have five minutes. Two amendments  have been selected and are published on the Marshalled List. The proposers of  the amendments will have 10 minutes to propose and five minutes to wind up.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>: I beg to move</p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly calls for the establishment of a Rural  Health Taskforce with the objective of  delivering a focused and co-ordinated response  to the health needs of people living in rural areas, including:</p>
		    <p class="Q3MotionBullet">a shared vision and co-ordination of activities;</p>
		    <p class="Q3MotionBullet">the development of strategic alliances;</p>
		    <p class="Q3MotionBullet">proper healthcare as part of a Bill of Rights; and</p>
		    <p class="Q3MotionBullet">an assessment of best practice and examination of how  other European countries which share common borders deal with access to  healthcare.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. A large proportion  of the population lives in rural areas. <span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt; ">Rural  communities face particular challenges with regard</span> to transport, access to services and  sustainability of local communities.  Those differences must be recognised and models of care to meet rural  needs must be explored. However, we realise that hospitals cannot be provided  at the end of every street. Indeed, in many cases, it is not hospitals that  rural communities need most. That is in direct contrast to the default centralisation  response <span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt; ">embedded in the organisational  psyche of the Department</span> of Health,  Social Services and Public Safety (DHSSPS) through items such as the trauma report and the reviews of  pathology, maternity and children&rsquo;s services &mdash; I could go on.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Suffice to say that almost all consultations and strategies  under direct rule have defaulted to the centralisation of services of the  so-called golden six hospitals. There are  many reasons for that &mdash; a lack of staff; a lack of consultants; and a lack of clinical safety. However, most people believe that services are centralised  because of a lack of vision and  strategic thought in the DHSSPS and  that the overarching goal is to cut costs and services.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Bairbre de Br&uacute;n did much to rectify that imbalance and  challenge the bias against rural communities. It is unfortunate that her  ambitions and plans faltered under direct  rule. A rural health task force is needed to address all issues affecting rural communities in  accessing health and <span style="letter-spacing:-.25pt; ">health services  and to ensure that the health and well-being</span> of people living in rural  communities is paramount. Such a task force must explore how to work with the rest of the island: that is common sense.  Currently, there are two competing health systems, and it is rural communities, particularly those located along the  border corridor, that are losing out as a result.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The task force should  study best practice from across Europe.  When faced with similar problems, other countries  have developed new and innovative approaches to rural healthcare. We must learn from their example. To that end, a Sinn F&eacute;in working group visited the  Centre for Rural Health in Scotland last  year. The centre has worked with the Scottish Executive and in  partnership with Norway. I am happy to furnish the Assembly with details.  Having taken the political decision to protect, enhance and sustain rural  communities, the Scottish Executive adopted a specific system of healthcare  that, while not perfect, did not adopt a one-size-fits-all approach.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Kerr Report in Scotland sought  to retain, maintain and maximise the services that could be safely  provided in rural towns and villages via a range of innovative proposals and models. The proposals included aspects such as extended primary care; a resilient  system of urgent and emergency care,  including air ambulances; a rural general hospital, which meant  re-exploring the issue of general surgeons with the royal colleges; midwife-led  maternity units; and 24/7 care provided by rural practitioners, etc.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As yet, there is no clear  agreement between politicians and those charged with delivering services  on the best way forward. Furthermore, it is true to say that those involved in  delivering services have not reached agreement  on the best way forward either. The outworking of that situation has  meant that political and electoral considerations have, on occasion, dominated  what should be real health considerations.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We need to look at examples of good practice, such as the  strategic approach of the Cooperation and Working Together (CAWT) programme,  which considers health inequalities. That programme, and others like it, should  be supported and resourced. Health inequalities should become a stand-alone  issue, which would help to put the information and recommendations emerging  from current work on addressing inequalities into operation, particularly for  those in the rural community.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The work being undertaken to address health inequalities in the CAWT region should be  co-ordinated, as it appears that everyone is doing their own piece of work. No one is co-ordinating the overall  picture, and there is no overall plan. People living in rural communities  therefore fall between two stools and miss  out as a result.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Community and partnership development is ongoing in health  action zones in the North, and the county development boards in the South  should be further developed. We need to develop an ethos of considering how to tackle health inequalities in rural  communities when developing services or initiatives. That would give  life to equality, and individuals could begin the process of delivering their  own services.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Further health profiles  for rural areas are needed. A regional health profile should be  developed so that an updated plan on the  health status of each region could be provided. Most of all, lessons  should be learned from the models already  cited in the CAWT region, such as health action zones and county  development boards, which must be taken into consideration in future plans.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in believes that it is crucial that a rural health  task force should develop a common vision for rural healthcare that will regain  the support of rural communities. It should develop an innovative strategy and  an action plan with which the Assembly and others can agree, and it should  provide good leadership and deliver health improvements to those in most need.  Go raibh maith agat.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Robert  Coulter</strong>: I beg to move amendment No 1: Leave out all after &ldquo;Assembly&rdquo; and  insert</p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;notes the ongoing work of the Rural Medicine Working Group  and urges the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety to ensure  that rural communities have access to safe and sustainable health services.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In May 2002, the Assembly adopted a policy of rural  proofing all legislation in Northern    Ireland to recognise the essentially rural  nature of much of the land area of the Province. The implementation of that  policy was placed in the hands of an interdepartmental steering group, which  was chaired by the then Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In 2001, a rural proofing co-ordinator had been appointed  in the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD). That Department  had primary responsibility for implementing the directions of the Assembly in  rural proofing all measures taken by the Assembly and the Executive.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I recall that while leadership on rural proofing was firmly  in the Department of the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, other  Departments in the Northern Ireland  Government had a less than enthusiastic approach to the issue. That ethos clearly emerged during a  meeting of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development on 3 May 2002 in  a session chaired by my colleague George Savage MLA.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Rural proofing was essentially about proofing draft  policies and making recommendations, on a cross-departmental basis, on the  implications for rural communities. In May 2002, it appeared that the  interdepartmental committee had not even agreed a working definition of what  rural proofing meant in practice. The Burns Report and the Hayes Report were  both due for publication at that time. Then, of course, the suspension of the  Assembly in 2002 intervened, and the matter has almost certainly been on ice  since then, given the somewhat patchy record of direct rule Ministers in such  matters.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I mention that because  the essence of what is contained in  the motion is partly subsumed into the provisions that the earlier Assembly had already put into place for  the rural proofing of all legislative and administrative measures  adopted by the Assembly and the Executive.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">If rural proofing were  implemented adequately, there would  be no real need for a dedicated and specific rural health task force.  The rural proofing of all health issues would  ensure that all the impacts on the rural community would be covered  adequately.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As an example, I cite the air ambulance, which I  successfully proposed when major cuts in rural Health Service cover were being  proposed during suspension of the Assembly  from 2002 to 2005. If there had been no suspension, then the impact of  the effective withdrawal of emergency  ambulance cover would have been raised through  the rural proofing of that policy. As it was, there was no effective  rural proofing of health reorganisation policies,  and I had to lead a public campaign to demand air ambulance emergency  cover for remote rural areas of the Province, especially in the glens of  Antrim.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I contend that the motion has more to do with doctrinaire  North/South health co-operation than with improving healthcare in rural areas  per se.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Excellent, professional-led relationships already exist  between health authorities north and south of the border, and those should  proceed on a health-led basis without cheap political capital being made from  them.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">10.45 am</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Robert Coulter</strong>: This is yet another example of a motion  proposing objectives that have not been properly costed. The Assembly cannot  insert proper healthcare into some bill of rights without saying how we shall pay for it. The motion is also  subjective, because what is &ldquo;proper healthcare&rdquo;? It must be defined. One  man&rsquo;s &ldquo;proper healthcare&rdquo; may not be another&rsquo;s. Everyone wants the best  healthcare for everyone; no one can question  my commitment to that aim after years of defending and extending  patients&rsquo; rights. However, putting proposals  to the Assembly without costing them properly  or saying from where the money will come does nobody any favours. In fact, it could lead to a great deal of embarrassment. Such proposals raise hopes that  could be dashed for lack of available finance.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There is an ongoing examination of the situation, so let us  reactivate or properly cost rural proofing as the Assembly envisaged back in  2002. This time, however, let us ensure that the civil servants implement rural  proofing and that all Departments conform  to Assembly policy. Let us use the machinery that we already have at our  disposal to look after the rural population. We must stop talking about it and  get on with the job.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Deeny</strong>: I  beg to move amendment No 2: Insert after &ldquo;alliances&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;&bull;&emsp;equal access to life-saving  services for all, irrespective of postcode;&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Thank you, Mr Speaker, for allowing me to speak to  my amendment. I also thank the two Sinn F&eacute;in MLAs for tabling this motion so  soon. The issue is close to my heart and important for us all.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I take on board what Bob Coulter has said, but I cannot accept his amendment, because it is too  specific. I have worked on the rural medicine working group, and,  although its work is to be commended, it does not look at maternity,  paediatric, surgical or accident and emergency services. The working group  focuses primarily on medical services for coronaries, pneumonia and so on. Its  remit is not wide enough. I have asked it to widen its scope and to look at  other issues that affect people in all areas, not just in rural areas.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Health provision &mdash; or the lack of it &mdash; in rural areas is  extremely important to Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s large rural communities. Equity and equality across Northern Ireland  is what this Assembly is all about, and that must also apply to healthcare provision. The Department of Health and  Social Services&rsquo;s &lsquo;Fit for the Future&rsquo; paper from 1998 cites equity as the  first principle of healthcare delivery. In 2002, the Department of Health,  Social Services and Public Safety&rsquo;s Investing for Health strategy proposed to  reduce health inequalities.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The vast majority of our landscape is made up of small  villages and rural communities. Some 54% of our  people live in small villages and rural communities, not in the more  densely populated cities of Belfast, Newry, Derry,  Armagh and Lisburn.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to bring to Members&rsquo; attention the  difference between elective treatment and emergency treatment. People are  generally fair-minded and do not mind travelling long distances to receive  elective treatment, which is non-urgent. Emergency treatment &mdash; when one&rsquo;s life  is seriously threatened &mdash; is a completely different ball game. Those of us who  work in front-line healthcare know that. Accessibility is vital in that area of  healthcare, as it will very often mean the difference between life and death.  Indeed, accessibility is really the major determinant in measuring standards of  emergency healthcare provision in any area.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, however  inconvenient the idea of running smaller  acute services for rural areas may be, those who live in rural areas  need &mdash; and quite rightly expect &mdash; to have effective, safe, modern and  accessible health services, just like urban dwellers.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion is therefore admirable, and I support it. However, it is essential to agree my amendment in  order to stop Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  current postcode lottery, which certainly  applies to the area in which I live and practise.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I tabled the amendment  because, having been a senior Health Service doctor for some years, I  believe that we cannot simply accept that our  postcodes should determine our standard of healthcare provision or  whether our children or grandchildren will  survive sudden and severe life-threatening illnesses such as meningitis,  severe asthma attacks or prolonged  epileptic seizures. Similarly, our postcodes should not be the deciding  factors that condemn our wives, daughters and granddaughters to delivering  their babies on floors or on the roadside, rather  than in the safety of a maternity unit. All Members must bear in mind  that such incidents occur.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I refer not just to those who have been involved in such  single isolated cases in remote areas; I am talking about the many thousands of people who are risk because of where  they live. It has been well documented that in my constituency this year there were four such dangerous births  in a 10-week period. Healthcare provision is essential for expectant women and  for rural people in general, and a dearth of such care is, to say the least,  primitive and unacceptable in any developed twenty-first century country.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I have repeatedly asked whether it is not more beneficial  for those who live in rural areas to be served by a small and well-managed  rural hospital rather than to die en route to a hospital in a larger location  that has state-of-the-art facilities? It is fine to have facilities in huge  hospitals, but they are no good to people who were dead on arrival.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is clear that infrastructure in rural areas is far worse  than that in other locations. For example, my own county has dreadful roads, no  rail network and no dual carriageways, never mind motorways. There is one dual  carriageway as we leave the county, but that is  it. Such a poor infrastructure worsens greatly people&rsquo;s accessibility to  healthcare provision and therefore contributes significantly to an unacceptable  standard of that provision.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The problems with rural healthcare provision in Northern Ireland are exactly the same in other  parts of these islands and in Europe. I agree  with the Members who tabled the motion that we should learn from our European  neighbours about how countries that share common  borders deal with access to healthcare provision. I live in a border  county, and I know that similar to tourism and infrastructure, people on both  sides of the border must work on healthcare  provision. That is known as joined-up thinking. Many Departments work in  that way, and it has been mentioned with  regard to healthcare. &lsquo;Cross-border Co-operation in Health Services in Ireland&rsquo;, a report by the Centre for Cross Border  Studies, stated that:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;It has been suggested that people living in the  vicinity of the border are materially disadvantaged on account of low levels of  economic activity, rurality and geographical isolation.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The report continues:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;As need for health  services is highly correlated with material deprivation, it is likely that  people living in border areas will have higher than average health needs.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Indeed, Professor John  Appleby&rsquo;s report &lsquo;Independent Review of Health and Social Care Services  in Northern Ireland&rsquo;  demonstrated that medical admission rates for those who are from deprived areas  are 41% higher than for those who are not from such areas.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">CAWT is one good example of cross-border joined-up thinking on healthcare. It is good that  CAWT&rsquo;s work, which has been ongoing for several years, covers places  such as Cavan, Sligo and Enniskillen. However,  an example of a dreadful lack of joined-up thinking is the main road from Dublin to Donegal, which  is approximately 170 miles long. It is soon to be upgraded on both sides of the  border &mdash; the A5 in the North and the N2 in the South &mdash; to either motorway or  dual carriageway status.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">That long stretch of modern road network will always be the  main road north-west from Dublin, and many  thousands of cars will travel on it, yet no acute hospital with any form of  emergency services is to be located anywhere along that major route on the island of Ireland. What would happen if a major  incident occurred with no emergency services nearby? That is another example of  an absence of joined-up thinking, and it clearly shows the importance of  adopting such an approach.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As medicine progresses and medical treatments continue to  improve, the healthcare provision of the future will be different. In the  not-too-distant future, GPs will lead primary-care teams in providing the  majority of health services. We certainly do not want, or need, large acute hospitals at every corner. However, we must  realise that there is a need for smaller acute hospitals that are equipped to  provide life-saving resuscitation and ventilation services. GPs are neither  qualified nor insured to provide those services. Furthermore, the failure to  provide such essential services in rural  areas will have an extremely detrimental effect on GP recruitment in  those areas. GPs do not want to set up home and practise in an area bereft of  emergency hospital backup. I can vouch for that, as it is happening in my area.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">For any Department with responsibility for health to suggest that rural hospitals are no longer  required because rural GPs will be  able to provide such emergency services in future is a totally false and  dangerous assertion. In fact, the lack of  rural hospital services will lead to fewer GPs practising in rural  areas.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Scotland  has large rural communities, but there are small hospitals in the Shetland  Islands, Orkney Islands, Western Isles and  the Highlands. The six acute hospitals  in the Highlands provide services for less than 8% of Scotland&rsquo;s  population. Some 168,000 people live in my county, yet there is a real  possibility that there will be no services for 10% of the population. The  previous session of the Scottish Parliament  established a steering group to focus on remote and rural areas, and the  Assembly should do likewise. I intend to  visit a hospital in one of the areas  that I mentioned to see how healthcare is provided in rural areas.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I ask Members to support amendment No 2.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  The motion refers to healthcare across  borders. I shall focus on cross-border co-operation in healthcare,  especially in rural areas. In the 1998 agreement, health was one area where  North/South co-operation was to be developed. The DUP has consistently stated  that it does not oppose cross-border co-operation, as long as it is based on  sound practical grounds for the benefit of  the people of Northern Ireland  and that it is not driven by an  underlying political agenda.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In the aftermath of the Omagh bomb, professionals from both  sides of the border provided emergency care for victims. Few would disagree  that it makes obvious common sense to co-operate in such instances, or in  response to road traffic accidents, for example. Indeed, lives can be saved as  a result.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">One current project  involving GP out-of-hours services allows patients to attend the nearest  centre, irrespective of whether it is in the same jurisdiction as their home.  However, we must remember that it is the people of Northern Ireland whom we ultimately  serve, and that they are our responsibility. As an illustration of that, an agreement between Altnagelvin and Letterkenny  hospitals includes one condition governing co-operative action that  provides that no proposal should undermine the service currently provided in either hospital. Furthermore, both  hospitals have vowed that co-operation must be confined to services that a  particular hospital cannot see itself providing in five to 10 years.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">On a slightly more  negative note, the EU publication, &lsquo;Patient Mobility in the European  Union: Learning from Experience&rsquo;, states that:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;There is also a long-established practice of  residents of the Republic of Ireland accessing free care in Northern Ireland  through the use of an &lsquo;accommodation address&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The publication further states that the extent of the  practice is:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;very difficult to quantify, but may be substantial.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">That concern should be investigated and action should be  taken.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In 1996-97, 0&middot;3% of patients treated in Northern Ireland were from the Irish Republic.  By 2003-04, some seven years later, that figure rose to 0&middot;4%. The corresponding statistic for Northern Ireland  patients being treated across the border fell from 0&middot;13% to  0&middot;11%.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">11.00 am</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The significance of, or potential for, cross-border  activity may well have been exaggerated. In its conclusions on the rationale  for cross-border co-operation in healthcare in Ireland, the authors of the EU  report on patient mobility admitted that:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;we have not been able to find any detailed appraisal  that could be used to justify public investment in a cooperation strategy or in  individual initiatives. For example, although there is a general presumption that the population of border areas  suffer from unmet need for hospital  services, comparative analyses of mortality and utilization data  conducted for the earlier study failed to confirm this.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The people of Northern   Ireland have benefited enormously from the tripartite  relationship with the National Cancer  Institute in the USA,  and will continue to do so. Northern Ireland  is producing world-class research into  innovative treatments for cancer. Such co-operation, which threatens no one, is to be welcomed and can  have positive consequences. However, its impact on general health  provision must be kept in careful perspective. The DUP supports the Ulster  Unionist amendment.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Hanna</strong>: I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate. We can  learn from the rural medicine working group mentioned in the motion. However,  the amendment proposed by Rev Coulter  dilutes the substance of the motion. I support Dr Deeny&rsquo;s amendment.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Rural life is often thought to be idyllic and good for  one&rsquo;s health. However, that is not necessarily the case in reality. Deprivation  and social exclusion have a negative impact on the health of people who live  and work in rural communities. More research on rural health issues is required  to better understand and target the complex health needs of people in rural  areas and, in turn, inform policy that will positively influence their health  and well-being.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I hope and expect that  the new health framework will result  in the adequate decentralisation of health services and the necessary  coterminosity. Complementary and interdependent community, primary and acute  services are required. Those services will  require adequate staffing levels:  doctors; nurses; physiotherapists; occupational and speech therapists;  and all allied health professionals.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Many rural areas do not have a doctor&rsquo;s surgery or pharmacy  nearby, and going to hospital requires a lengthy commute. Poor transport, poor  geographical access to services and poor roads infrastructure all contribute to  what is known as the &ldquo;distance decay&rdquo; effect on those who live in the country.  Availability and choice of services in rural areas are very different to those  found in the towns. Social facilities, especially for disabled people, are  often inadequate.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">All countries with a significant rural populace face similar healthcare challenges. In developing a  vision for healthcare provision, Northern Ireland can learn how to establish best practice from its European  counterparts. The highly developed Scandinavian rural healthcare system  can provide knowledge and experience. Turning to cross-border co-operation, I  have worked with CAWT. That body has been very helpful in that regard, but its  work must be built on.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Ramsey</strong>:  The Member mentioned decentral&shy;isation, and I note that the Minister of Health,  Social Services and Public Safety is in the Chamber. Given that thousands of  people in the rural north-west are waiting for cancer screening and breast  screening, why has a consultation document on the centralisation of pathology services from Altnagelvin  Hospital to Belfas<span style="letter-spacing:0pt; ">t</span> been published? Over 10,000 tests that were carried  out over the border have been  analysed in laboratories in Altnagelvin   Hospital. Why is the  Department insisting on centralising such services in Belfast?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Hanna</strong>: I  thank my colleague for making that point. I  will allow the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety to answer those questions. I  agree with Mr Ramsey; I support  decentralisation, particularly with regard to healthcare.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Road traffic accidents are also a major problem in country  areas, with young people often suffering major traumas. I am in favour of the  trauma centre. However, to base the centre in Belfast will have implications for people who  live in the countryside. There is concern that that will lead to downgrading of  local hospitals and will have an adverse effect on rural communities. In order  to alleviate those concerns, local hospitals must remain capable of dealing  with emergencies.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Training and skills retention are problematic when exposure  to major trauma is sporadic and access to training  courses is limited by time, distance and money. That must be tackled. An efficient and adequately trained  ambulance service is essential for the provision of an efficient trauma system  that is based on the principle of equity of treatment for all. The bottom line  is that hospitals must have the ability to  stabilise trauma patients should the need arise.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There is also the  problem of recruitment and retention of healthcare staff in rural areas.  There is no quick fix when approaching the complexity of rural healthcare, but the issue must be tackled. Health promotion is  crucial. Dissemination of education and information, as well as outreach  working, is important for the improvement of rural communities&rsquo; overall health.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Elderly people who live  in rural communities endure major problems. I am a firm believer in  community care. The Assembly must ensure that the right services are provided in good time to those who need them  most and that those who receive help can have a greater say in whether they stay at home in a domestic  environment for as long as possible  so that care in residential nursing homes and hospitals can be reserved  for those whose needs cannot be met in any other way. A concentrated  multi-departmental and agency approach is required.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Buchanan</strong>:  Members will be aware that people who live in rural areas, particularly those  who live in the south-west of the Province, feel that facilities are much too  heavily focused on Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s larger population centres. No  place has suffered more from a decline in rural healthcare provision and  life-saving facilities than my constituency of West Tyrone. That issue has been  well documented and brought to the attention  of direct rule Ministers on numerous occasions over the years. I am sure  that all Members will agree that people across Northern Ireland are entitled to  the same level of provision, equality of access and live-saving facilities no  matter from where they come.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to focus on primary-care provision in a rural  setting. People in rural areas must be able to access services conveniently. Better-organised public transport is  essential. Improved co-ordination and planning of transport schemes is needed  locally and regionally. Transport considerations must be integrated into any  healthcare planning for rural or remote communities. There must be  multi-professional working across different disciplines. Patients in rural  areas must also have access to self-management programmes.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The use of telemedicine  must be encouraged. It permits increased flexibility for healthcare  service providers and allows them to expand the scope and quality of services.  It is also cost-effective and provides expertise that would otherwise not be  available.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In order to maintain optimum services in rural areas, it  must be possible to recruit and retain sufficient staff. The 2005 British  Medical Association (BMA) report, &lsquo;Healthcare in a rural setting&rsquo;, identifies  areas where recruitment and retention can  be maximised. It suggests that health professionals should all have  received rural placements when they were students. That opportunity should be  seen as a positive contribution to a student&rsquo;s development. Placing students in  a rural area should promote working in such an area as a positive career  choice. Postgraduate training programmes must use the opportunities that are  provided in rural primary and secondary care to teach healthcare professionals  general skills.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Continuing professional development should be flexible and  responsive to meet the range of needs in rural or remote areas. For far too  long staff employed in rural areas have not  had appropriate access to training, and  that must be addressed urgently. Schemes to support healthcare professionals and their families in  local areas are vital, and flexible employment arrangements must be made  available so that highly professional standards are retained.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The general medical services contract for medical services and primary care contains a specific  adjustment to cater for rural areas.  That adjustment takes population sparsity and dispersal into account and  ensures that rural practices are not short-changed.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Staff working in rural  areas have many extra burdens &mdash; just getting to training courses, for  example, can be problematic. Given the areas in which they live, many people  are often involved in providing emergency care outside the hospital setting.  Healthcare in rural areas depends on two vital matters: recruitment of  healthcare professionals and the accessibility and sustainability of services. To bring that about there must be more  joined-up working across the Departments to ensure that there is good  quality of healthcare provision in rural areas.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I call on the Minister  to give a commitment that rural communities  across the Province will have access to safe and sustainable services.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McHugh</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. The debate is timely, and as someone  from the rural constituency of Fermanagh and South Tyrone, the subject is close  to my heart.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As a Member for a rural constituency that continues to be  affected by the Department of Health, Social Services  and Public Safety&rsquo;s centralization agenda, I say that the debate should not focus on hospital services only but  take a holistic view of all health services, primary and acute, and preventative public health strategies such as  Investing for Health.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There is no doubt that hospital services, and equal access to them, are vital for rural communities.  It should be totally unnecessary for people to have to travel to cancer  services in Belfast.  Chemotherapy, and similar treatments, could easily be delivered at a local  level instead of having sick people make  taxi journeys because of the centralization agenda. Those services  should be made available in places such as the Erne Hospital  in Enniskillen and in the new hospital. The  rural health task force must resolve  that problem and move well beyond it.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">My constituents raise  concerns about a wide range of health issues and services. Recent  research highlighted increasing levels of child poverty and its correlation with ill health west of the Bann, yet access to  children&rsquo;s services in hospitals and  in the community is still difficult, with long waiting lists for even  basic services such as speech and language therapy and physiotherapy.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mental health is another  great concern given the social isolation of many people, particularly  the elderly, in rural areas. A solution must be found to break the cycle of  isolation that leads to poor mental health for which there is also poor access to services. Mental health services  should have been included in the list of services that the new hospital in  Enniskillen will provide. A further range of services could be brought to rural  areas.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">A rural health task force could do much innovative  groundwork to improve the lot of rural communities. It cannot and should not  focus only on the provision of acute services. A new approach is needed. We  have looked at Scotland and  at the Hebrides, areas that have proved that rural communities can be well  provided for by acute and other services, which would normally be found in  places such as London or Belfast.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">11.15 am</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore precedents for such approaches have been set.  Having visited the areas in which those services have been adopted and having given them consideration, it is clear  that they can be used as examples.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is not enough merely  to supply the services: quality services must be provided. In order for  that to happen, a health network must be established. That need not necessarily be initiated in Dublin;  perhaps either Belfast or even London could establish  it. People are much better off going to London  for treatment that will save their life or improve their long-term health than  going to a local hospital where they will receive mediocre services. Due to  certain difficulties, of which Dr Deeny is aware, that is presently the case  for many people.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Although I agree with his postcode lottery theory, Dr Deeny  knows the difficulties that local hospitals face in trying to deliver quality  healthcare provision. Given that rural hospitals  cannot offer career progression, they find it extremely difficult to  recruit nursing staff and consultants and doctors. Staff members simply do not want to come to places such as Fermanagh; Belfast&rsquo;s greater  career opportunities mean that they want to stay there. It does not matter how  many new hospitals are built: if quality  staff and consultants are not recruited, the outcome for patients will  be no better. We know that statistics have  proven that that is true of any services, even those that are provided  by garages and so forth, and it applies to  maternity and to other hospital services. The inability to attract highly qualified personnel plus the  necessity to recruit abroad present major difficulties.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Young people must also  be considered, and the lesson that  preventive medicine is the best medicine should be taught in schools.  Rural areas must be included in any broader consideration of education on those  matters. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Savage</strong>: I  support the amendment tabled by my hon Friend Dr Coulter. I commend Members  from the other side of the House on their interest in rural health matters.  However, I cannot support Dr Deeny&rsquo;s amendment, because the rural medicine  working group already delivers for the rural community. As a rural dweller, I am  pleased to thank that working group and to record my appreciation of its  sterling work.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The second half of Dr Coulter&rsquo;s amendment:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;urges the Minister of Health, Social Services and  Public Safety to ensure that rural communities have access to safe and sustainable  health services.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I echo that call,  because there is a feeling of isolation in the rural community. If one  is not fortunate enough to own a car, the  lack of public transport can deepen that sense of isolation, which, in  turn, has a negative impact on social  relations. Furthermore, isolation affects people&rsquo;s health as well as  their access to healthcare provision and public services. Stress is a major  concern for many people in rural areas, especially older people and the lonely. Sometimes, having someone to speak to can  have a major impact and can bring many benefits.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The home-help programme is the main link to the outside  world for some older people. It should be expanded  and given a budget increase so that the elderly, particularly those who are in rural areas, can  reap greater benefit from such a good scheme. I ask the Minister to  consider my request sympathetically.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The needs of older people should be at the heart of a  flexible and holistic response in the development of a more integrated Health Service.  The value that results from older people remaining in their rural communities should be a core vision. Therefore I am pleased to  support Dr Coulter&rsquo;s amendment.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Health, Social Services and Public  Safety (Mr McGimpsey)</strong>: I welcome the opportunity to debate the  establishment of a rural health task force. I am aware that people living in  rural areas can feel a sense of isolation and may have difficulty accessing  health and other services. Many people, particularly those in the south and west of the Province, have genuine  concerns about that, and the topic must be discussed in a mature and measured  way.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In expressing concern for the health and welfare of rural communities, I am in no way dismissing the  needs of the many urban people who also face difficulties.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">My concern as Health Minister has to be for the health and  social care needs of all of the people of Northern Ireland, wherever they may  live. Those needs will be different in different parts of the country, and are  often dependent on economic conditions and the age profile of the local  population. Some needs may be specifically related to either rural or urban  factors. The key point is that our system of care must be flexible enough to  address those needs, irrespective of where and how they materialise.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to emphasise that many factors that impact on  people&rsquo;s health cross Government Departments &mdash; factors such as housing, employment, education and the quality  of the environment. Health is a cross-cutting issue  that is the business of all Government Departments. My priority is to  improve the health and well-being of the whole population of Northern Ireland,  regardless of where they live.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I will start by referring to the Investing for Health  strategy that was launched in 2002 by my predecessor as devolved Health  Minister. That strategy is regarded by many, including many outside Northern Ireland,  as a model for public health strategy. Effectively, it recognised that health  and well-being issues crossed a number of Departments and issues, rather than  simply being &ldquo;health&rdquo;.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The general health of the people of Northern Ireland  has improved in recent years. The implementation of Investing for Health, in  particular, has brought about many tangible gains. Life expectancy has  increased in all areas and in all socio-economic groups. Death rates from diseases such as heart attacks, strokes,  cancers and respiratory diseases &mdash;  the main killers in our population &mdash; have fallen over the past few  years. Among those under 75 years of age,  deaths from coronary heart disease have fallen by 55%, and deaths from  strokes by almost 50%, in the last 10 years. Cancer-related deaths in the same  age group show an 18% drop.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, inequalities remain, and we must not become complacent. Mortality rates in Northern Ireland  are still too high and lag behind those of many other European  countries. A review of Investing for Health will  begin next year. I see that as a valuable opportunity to ensure that the  strategy is still fit for purpose. I will also be looking for any other actions  that can be taken to improve the health of our population, whether they live in  a rural or an urban setting.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is inarguable that accessing services can be more difficult for some people living in rural areas.  However, it is interesting to note some key health indicators that  compare the 20% most rural areas with the 20% most urban areas in Northern Ireland.  Men in rural areas can expect to live, on average, about one and a half years  longer than their counterparts in urban areas. Women living in the countryside  can expect to live almost six months longer  than those living in cities or towns. Infant mortality, a key measure of  the health of a population, is lower in  rural areas. The rate of teenage births in rural areas is less than half  that in urban areas. The suicide rate is also lower in rural areas.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Members will understand from that that the needs of some  urban communities are, potentially, as great as those of rural communities.  That is not in any way to dismiss the needs and concerns of rural communities;  I just want to illustrate that not all health indicators for rural communities  are negative. Living in the country has its upsides.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Investing for Health is being taken forward through a  partnership approach between statutory, voluntary and community organisations.  A health partnership has been established in each health and social services  board area, and each partnership has developed, and is implementing, a health  improvement plan for its area. That is in line with the priorities set out in  the strategy document and takes account of the needs of the local population,  including the particular needs of rural communities. We have some excellent  examples of innovative practice involving working in partnership. The  partnerships work with rural networks to take forward a range of health  improvements including, for example,  research to explore the impact of rural isolation on poverty and  disadvantage, and the promotion of dedicated transport to enable access to  services.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">My Department and the Department of Agriculture and Rural  Development (DARD) currently fund Rural Support, an organisation that provides  a telephone helpline, so work is being done. I firmly believe that living in a  rural area should not prevent people from receiving the necessary high-quality  care. In response to Bob Coulter&rsquo;s point, I must say that all healthcare  policies are subject to rural proofing.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">My Department&rsquo;s strategy for hospital services was  developed through the Developing Better Services programme and recognises that a balance must be struck between  ease of access for all and securing the medical benefits that are realised when  the expertise and technology needed for the treatment of more complex  conditions is brought together in an acute centre.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  I will be happy to give way when I finish this point.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We cannot all live close to an acute hospital, but, through  the plans for a network of acute and local hospitals, we ensure that everyone,  including those who live in the most rural communities, has access to the  required services for scheduled and emergency care. Developing Better Services  delivers a model of hospital provision that ensures that the vast majority of  people will be within 45 minutes of emergency care and consultant-led maternity  services, and that, on arrival, everyone will have access to those services  within one hour.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Does the Minister agree that there is a pressing need to retain resuscitation  and stabilisation facilities in hospitals such as Daisy Hill in Newry, and  other rural hospitals, in the event of major trauma? To do so may save lives in  areas where the &ldquo;golden hour&rdquo; may not be met because of poor rural roads.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  There are nine acute hospitals in Northern Ireland. Daisy Hill is one  of them, and it will retain the services to which the Member referred,  particularly trauma services.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Across Northern    Ireland, health boards and trusts have  introduced plans to make their services more responsive to local needs. I will  continue to drive plans to bring high-quality primary-care and community-care  services closer to where people live, and to invest in and improve the  Ambulance Service, to which Mrs Hanna referred. That is another key area.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The vast majority of services that people receive in  hospital settings do not need to be carried out at a large acute hospital, and  local hospitals will continue to deliver those services in future, typically at  outpatient, diagnostic, urgent-care and day-procedure services. The decentralisation  of some services that, in the past, have been delivered solely from Belfast, such as  chemotherapy for cancer patients, is also a feature of my Department&rsquo;s  strategy.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Ramsey mentioned pathology services. A new laboratory at  Altnagelvin Hospital opened last year at a cost of  &pound;18 million. There are no plans to move that; it is very much part of the  fabric of services in the area. Consultation on the future of pathology  services is under way. By the end of February 2007, the closing date for  responses, we had received 280, which we are working our way through. We are  not yet in a position to decide on the future of pathology services, so I will  not predict what the final recommendations might be.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  We are dealing with the topical issue of healthcare and health services for  rural areas. As someone who lives in a rural area, the Minister may be aware of  detrimental changes to the care practice for nurses in some smaller GP  practices. Those changes undermine confidence in the level of medical care  available there.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">11.30 am</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, I was unfortunate to have to attend the accident  and emergency department of a local hospital from Friday evening until the  early hours of Saturday morning. I  discovered that the only method of commun&shy;ication that medical staff had  with ambulance control to obtain an ambulance was to dial 999. That is totally  unsatisfactory. Some members of staff at the hospital asked me to highlight  that to the Minister.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  I thank the Member for those points. I am not in a position to comment, but I  will be happy to talk to him afterwards. It is not satisfactory that the only  way for medical staff to get an ambulance is to ring 999. The Department will  look at that matter along with other issues concerning ambulances.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Care practices for nurses have been brought to my attention  again. I have not had the opportunity to deal with the subject, however, I  would be happy to talk about care practices for nurses in the Member&rsquo;s area.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Linking services is a critical part of the review of rural  medicine, which is being carried out by the Chief Medical Officer. That review is examining how inpatient medical  services can be delivered in local and rural hospital settings. I am sure that  Members agree that the review is important,  and I look forward to receiving the Chief Medical Officer&rsquo;s assessment  of the findings at the end of the summer.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The largest proportion of health and social care needs are  met by primary and community services in Northern Ireland. My Department&rsquo;s  20-year strategy for health and social care, which is called A Healthier Future, is currently beginning, and will ensure a  front-line role for primary and community care services. It is important that the strategy will focus on making  services, such as out-of-hours services, more accessible as well as  expanding the range of services that are available close to people&rsquo;s homes.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">To support the  strategy, there will be major investment in primary and community care  services through an extensive network of health and care centres across Northern    Ireland over the next 10 years. It is anticipated that there will be 41  health and care centres, each of which will be designed to meet the needs of  the local population. It is expected that each centre will provide a generic  range of services including treatment, care, information,  chronic-disease-management programmes and some diagnostic services currently  only provided in a hospital setting.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The strategy is about  placing an emphasis on primary care &mdash; that is what people have told me  that they want from local health and social care services, and that is what I  want to see delivered. I will continue to work with cross-border agencies such  as CAWT to explore opportunities for more effective healthcare solutions to the  problems faced by people living along the border. Our health boards are working  with their counterparts across the border;  a cross-border pilot scheme is underway in the north-west, which is  creating mutually beneficial cross-border arrangements.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am not convinced that a rural health task force is the best way forward at the moment. I say that in  light of ongoing developments &mdash; the  review of rural medicine; the pending review of the Investing for Health  strategy and the prospect of duplication that may arise from the creation of another  task force.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I believe strongly that rural health and well-being must  involve a wider response across Government. However, I will consider how to  best take forward the spirit of the motion and address the issues involved in  improving the health and well-being of people living in rural communities. In  doing so, I will take the views of my ministerial colleagues, as the health and  well-being of our local communities is an issue for all of us. It is a shared&mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I remind the Minister his time is almost up.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  Thank you. It is a shared responsibility.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Deeny</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his presence. He has been at many of the debates on  health, which is good. Nobody is suggesting that there should be large acute hospitals in every town in Northern Ireland  &mdash; that is nonsensical.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We are talking about establishing rural hospitals that have  acute services that will save lives. Such hospitals exist in the National  Health Service Scotland system, for example.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Carmel Hanna, speaking as a former health professional,  made a good point. We are requesting the establishment of rural hospitals that  have stabilisation facilities &mdash; they work in Scotland and can work here. Such  hospitals need not be huge; the important point is that their acute facilities  would allow patients to be stabilised before they are transferred to larger  hospitals for appropriate treatment.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The current plans to develop better services do not apply  to some areas, including my own. Currently, transporting people the length of  the M1 is a chance that must be taken in the hope that patients are still alive  when they arrive at the acute facility.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Smaller acute services in rural areas can be run efficiently and effectively with the approval and  guidance of the royal colleges. The colleges have not been mentioned,  but they are important players that decide which hospitals close. If  consultants&rsquo; skills cannot be maintained, and facilities and services are not  provided for the training of junior  doctors, a hospital has no future.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Gerry McHugh made a well-made point about staff, and I  agree that attracting good staff to country areas is a serious problem. The  answer lies in staff rotation, which occurs in some places. If that were  adopted on a wider scale, a condition for employment in larger urban hospitals  would be that consultants and junior doctors would spend some time in smaller  rural hospitals. If rotation were introduced, the problem of attracting doctors  to rural areas would be removed and doctors&rsquo; skills would be maintained.  Therefore rotation is the future.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister mentioned the healthcare needs of the urban  population, and although I am proud of the fact that I live in the country, I  do not suggest for a minute that the needs of urban dwellers should be  overlooked &mdash; of course they should not. However, I have come across a mother who told me that before she has  children she plans to move from her home to live with her sister because where she lives is unsafe. In Belfast, where each  hospital can be seen and walked to from the others, people argue over whether a baby should be born in one hospital  or another. I see that disparity day and daily in healthcare provision. We must  not deny city dwellers what they need, but  let us have a sense of fair play. People are actually leaving the area  in which I live and work in order to give birth safely.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Despite the UUP amendment, I ask that party&rsquo;s Members to  vote on health issues instead of according to party direction. Amendment No 1  is well made and well intentioned, but it focuses on medical care, which includes coronary heart attacks, pneumonias and  strokes. That is a single area of medicine that I know and of which I  have been a part. The UUP amendment relates simply  to medicine. People outside the medical profession do not realise that  &ldquo;medicine&rdquo; is simply a branch of what is known collectively as medicine. I made  that point to the rural medicine working group when I told it that it must  widen its scope to consider the needs of children and mothers and the future of  trauma services in rural areas. If Members  support the UUP amendment, they will  neglect and deny the rights of our mothers and children and those of us  who will suffer trauma. That amendment does not consider the needs of rural  areas, and therefore, as a doctor, I cannot support it.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">A rural health task  force is a good idea and is the way forward. That is why I support the  motion. The remote and rural steering group was established in Scotland. I  assume that it is still in place, and I volunteer to investigate how the Scottish Parliament looks after rural people.  Members owe it to all the people in Northern Ireland, whether they live  in cities or in rural areas, to provide  decent and acceptable modern-day healthcare. I urge Members to support the motion and my amendment.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  The UUP&rsquo;s commitment to rural areas and to rural proofing is well documented.  My party colleague Mr Elliott has championed that agenda for several years. I am much encouraged that this  debate has not been characterised by an urban-rural divide, because that  is not a helpful road to travel. Our aim is to secure quality healthcare for  everyone.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am encouraged that the  Minister is, again, present for the  debate. He mentioned several points that are of great interest to me. At a meeting of the Committee for  Health, Social Services and Public  Safety last week, I asked the Minister about establishing a good  cross-departmental arrangement. On too many issues, when one mentions the word &ldquo;rural&rdquo; the matter immediately goes to  DARD, and everyone else forgets that they share responsibility. If one  mentions mental health, the issue goes to the Health Department, and other  Departments forget that they too have some  responsibility for those matters. The Minister has, quite rightly, made  it clear that he will take up this vitally important matter with ministerial colleagues to secure a proper cross-departmental  response.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Dr Coulter and I have  tabled our amendment because, as Dr Coulter quite rightly said, issues  of cross-border co-operation must be entirely health-led and not, as Mrs Robinson put it, driven by some other agenda.  Mrs Hanna quite rightly said that we want to establish best practice. I  am sure that no one in the House would disagree  with that. We want best practice across the board.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McHugh mentioned the Scottish experience. In the  Scottish isles, there are areas of isolation that go way beyond anywhere in Northern Ireland.  There may be excellent examples of best practice in Scotland to examine and from which  to gain knowledge and ideas.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not accept Dr Deeny&rsquo;s arguments on the UUP amendment. Our amendment is quite clear, and I do  not see how Dr Deeny can argue with  urging the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety to:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;ensure that rural  communities have access to safe and sustainable health services.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That is what we are seeking. There is nothing weak  or watery about &ldquo;safe and sustainable services&rdquo;.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  Was the Member more than surprised when the Member for West Tyrone Dr Deeny, at  the last meeting of the Health Committee,  indicated that no hospital should be built in Omagh or the Tyrone area?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I was very surprised that Dr Deeny did not want the building of a new &pound;190  million hospital in his constituency.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Deeny</strong>: It  is not a hospital.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  It is being called a hospital and it represents &pound;190 million of investment in  health in his constituency. It was a great surprise that Dr Deeny wanted to  stop that project.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am encouraged by the Minister&rsquo;s comments on Rural Support  and the work that his Department and DARD have been doing to fund that group.  That is an organisation with which I have  had previous involvement.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Our amendment sums up  our approach to this matter. The Minister has, in his short period in  office so far, driven home the message that he is not interested in quick fixes for health services &mdash; he wants a  sustainable future for healthcare; sustainable safe access for all our  citizens, urban and rural; no postcode lottery; and the best health system in  the world, provided by the best staff in the world.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">11.45 am</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. T&aacute; s&eacute; beartaithe agam f&eacute;in agus ag  Car&aacute;l N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n go nglaonn an Tion&oacute;l seo go mbuna&iacute;tear tascfh&oacute;rsa um shl&aacute;inte  tuaithe.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As the Speaker knows, Sinn F&eacute;in is strongly calling for the  establishment of a rural health task force to respond to and meet the health  needs of people who live in rural areas. We appreciate the Minister&rsquo;s attendance and participation in the debate and in  respect of all health-related debates that have taken place in the  Assembly so far.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">People who live in  rural areas are more likely to suffer ill health. Healthcare is a basic  human requirement and a basic human right; it should be included in a future  bill of rights.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">This has been a well-informed debate, and as many of those  who took part have personal experience of the deficit  of health services in rural areas, I am glad that the Minister has taken every opportunity to apprise  himself of the special health needs  of people in rural communities.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in will accept  the amendment tabled by Kieran Deeny.  It makes eminent sense to include the reference to:</p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;equal access to life-saving services for all, irrespective  of postcode;&rdquo;.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">As proposers of  the motion, we are not inclined to accept Rev Coulter&rsquo;s amendment, as it  is too minimalist and does not have a wide enough scope.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Essentially, we seek strong acknowledgement and strong  investment of the necessary resources by the Department in relation to special  health problems that arise from living in a rural community. Distance from  essential health services is a real issue, and poor road infrastructure and  lower socio-economic status are just some of the reasons for the major deficit  in health provision experienced by people living in rural areas.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There are general low levels of health in the North, both  urban and rural, but the rural situation must be accentuated.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I thank the Member for giving way. Would he  support a &pound;190 million investment in healthcare provision in the West  Tyrone constituency?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>: I thank the Member for his intervention. I would accept the  &pound;190 million and seek to build on it, in order to provide proper acute services  in the area.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Simpson</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  No. I will carry on, because it gets out of hand sometimes, David.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">A significant proportion of the population lives in rural  areas; urban models do not support the rural situation. How often have Members  heard the excuse that investing in 20% of facilities will cater for 80% of the  population? The 80:20 rule and figures should be thrown out of the window.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am glad that several Members drew attention to the Cooperation and Working Together (CAWT)  model. I ask Members to study the  report on health inequalities that was published by CAWT following a  one-day conference in March 2005. As other Members said, CAWT is an agreement  between health boards adjacent to the border with the stated objective of  improving the health and social well-being of the population.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is regrettable that too few areas for joint working have  been carried forward despite the fact that health is an area of co-operation under the Good Friday Agreement. To respond to Rev Coulter&rsquo;s comments, Sinn F&eacute;in is  not being doctrinaire in relation to the health issue. This motion is  not about cheap political capital.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Far be it from me to quote someone of whom I am not the  biggest fan &mdash; and in fact on one occasion, I joined one of the DUP Members for  West Tyrone and others to occupy the office  of this Minister; I do not think we were breaking the law, Tom, but we  did it anyway. Nevertheless, I agree with Sean Woodward&rsquo;s view that North-South  co-operation in relation to health was &ldquo;the patients&rsquo; solution&rdquo;. Let us put the  patients first.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">My colleague John O&rsquo;Dowd challenged Members to name an area of service provision or social policy  where North/South cooperation would  produce a better outcome than that of healthcare.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">More initiatives are  needed to reduce health inequalities in  rural areas, not least in border communities. I commend to Members an  initiative in the Carrickmore area of mid-Tyrone. The initiative is well known  to Dr Kieran Deeny, who is a GP in the area. Indeed, I wish to put on the  record that he is my GP. <em>[Laughter.]</em></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I appeal for calm. <em>[Laughter.]</em></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The rural link to health scheme is an excellent initiative  that transports people to the local health centre to attend their appointments.  The scheme also affords people the opportunity to go to the post office at the  same time, for example. It was created by GPs in the Carrickmore practice, with  input from the health action zone partnership and the Investing for Health  strategy.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The scheme is a good  example of how the provision of transport  can help to meet the needs of rural communities. I hope that that pilot  scheme will continue to be funded in the future. In a rural area such as  mid-Tyrone, the scheme performs an  essential service. As has already been well articulated, the needs of  that community are great.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">On the issue of North/South cooperation, I wish to  highlight the issue of GP out-of-hours access. Sinn F&eacute;in is not being  doctrinaire or engaging in cheap political point scoring on that issue. A  person living in Lifford in County Donegal &mdash; one mile from Strabane &mdash; who falls  sick in the evening or at the weekend is expected to travel to the North Western  Association of Doctors on Call in Letterkenny, around 15 miles away. There is a  perfectly good GP out-of-hours service just one mile away in Strabane, but that  service has not been part of either of the two cross-border schemes that have  been piloted to date.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Those pilot schemes struggled to get off the ground because of resistance from within DHSSPS. One  scheme was located in the  Castleblaney, Keady and Crossmaglen areas; the other in the Derry and Inishowen areas. A similar pilot scheme should be introduced in the Lifford and  Strabane areas. That is the patient&rsquo;s solution; in supporting it, I am neither  being doctrinaire nor engaging in cheap political point scoring.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in does not  support Rev Coulter&rsquo;s amendment because it is too minimalist and its  scope needs to be widened. My party specifically wants a task force to be established as it would be a demonstration of  political will. The Minister said that he would take forward the spirit  of the motion. I commend him on classic departmental-speak. What did he mean?  Why will he not set up, or be seen to set up, a properly resourced task force  with the objective of reducing health inequalities in rural areas? That would  demonstrate real political will and real investment.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Other Members have spoken in their capacity as constituency  representatives. As a Member for West Tyrone, I ask the Minister to intervene  to ensure that the urgent care treatment  centre and the high-dependency unit  at the Tyrone County Hospital  are retained, developed and expanded to meet the needs of people as a  part of a wider solution to the problems of health provision west of the Bann. He should not allow an urgent-care  treatment centre to become a minor injuries unit. Go raibh m&iacute;le maith  agat.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>: Before I put the Question on amendment No 1, I wish to advise  Members that if amendment No 1 is made, amendment No 2 will fall. I shall then  put the Question on the motion as amended.</p>

		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Main Question, as amended, put and agreed to.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That this Assembly notes the ongoing work of the Rural  Medicine Working Group and urges the Minister of Health, Social Services and  Public Safety to ensure that rural communities have access to safe and  sustainable health services.</p>
		    <p class="H4StageHeading">Provision of Speech and Language Therapy</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour and 30 minutes for  the debate. The proposer of the motion will have 10 minutes to propose and 10  minutes for the winding-up speech. All other  Members who wish to speak will have five minutes.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Ramsey</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That this Assembly notes the inequalities in the  provision of speech and language therapy throughout Northern Ireland, and calls on the  Executive to provide adequate and equitable resources and financial support.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion is not intended as any criticism of, or  reflection on, the good work of speech and language therapists, managers or  technical assistants.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">For the past five years, I have been working closely with a  group of parents in Derry whose children have  been statemented and require speech and language therapy. Unfortunately, for  some of those parents, their children have come of age &mdash; they are 18 &mdash; and no  longer have access to speech and language therapists. Their stories are  alarming. However, the parents are continuing with their campaign to ensure  that other children do not face similar disadvantages.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I have attended numerous meetings with health boards and  trusts. I remember a meeting with a direct rule Minister whose arrogance and  ignorance left a lot to be desired. He took a telephone call during the meeting  and did not even introduce his departmental officials to the parents who had  accompanied me. Imagine the impression that his behaviour made on those  parents: it did not give them much confidence in direct rule.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In 2006, a follow-up review carried out by the Northern Ireland  Commissioner for Children and Young People (NICCY) reported that over half the  children who required assessment or speech therapy in the Western Health and  Social Services Board area could not access those services. NICCY found also  that speech and language therapy services are allocated on the basis of a  postcode lottery, meaning that the area in which one lives has a huge bearing  on the expected waiting time for assessment and treatment.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In my constituency of Foyle, children can wait for up to 18  months to be assessed by speech and language therapists and receive the  necessary therapy. In anyone&rsquo;s life, especially that of a five- or six-year-old  child, 18 months is a huge amount of time. Such a delay in assessment and  treatment impedes a child&rsquo;s learning and his or her enjoyment of school.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Parents in my constituency are being forced to fight with  health authorities to obtain the services that their children need and are  entitled to as of right. That situation cannot be allowed to continue.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There has been systematic failure of leadership and  management. For example, in 2004, John Hume tabled a series of questions in the  Westminster Parliament about speech therapy services. It transpired that the  most basic information about the length of the various waiting lists, waiting  times and budget allocations for speech and language therapy across the trust  areas was not available to the then Minister to allow for strategic  decision-making, allocation of resources and equality assurance. Clearly, there  was no central control and, more worryingly, no democratic interest in  providing an essential service for our children.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is clear that there are simply too few speech and  language therapists in the system generally, and, particularly, in some areas  such as Foyle. I mentioned earlier that I met repeatedly with Health Service  managers. They told me that they could not recruit and retain speech and  language therapists. It turned out that speech and language therapists in the  Foyle Trust area were earning less than those employed in other trust areas.  That is no longer the case, but it seems that posts are simply not available  for speech and language therapists who want to work in the Foyle Trust area.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Dallat] in the Chair)</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Parents and users have  serious concerns about moneys allocated by the Department through the  children and young people&rsquo;s funding package for 2006-08. The use of that  funding will discriminate against children in mainstream education who need  speech and language therapy. The Department  has made &pound;1 million available. However,  parents have serious concerns that the money is only to be used by special schools and language units  attached to special schools. That presents a serious problem for children with  special needs who attend mainstream schools  in that they will not be able to avail of the services being offered to  children who attend special schools. That situation cannot be tolerated.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In the Foyle Trust area, there is a ratio of one speech  therapist to 3,200 children, compared to the Southern Health and Social  Services Board area, which offers one speech therapist to 1,700 children. That  difference in provision leaves a lot to be desired.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to talk about the current lack of resources and the costs that will no doubt rise from our call  to provide more speech therapists. Given the money that is spent on public administration in Northern Ireland &mdash; Members are all aware  of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  burgeoning public sector &mdash; is it not amazing that front-line services in speech  therapy and other essential areas are so poor? On the face of it, given what is  being spent, we should have the best public services in the world. However, we  do not.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There has been a systematic and long-term failure of  strategic direction from direct rule Ministers, and subsequent mismanagement,  which has resulted in cumbersome, bureaucratic systems that do not deliver the  services that people need.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Non-delivery of essential services would not be tolerated  in the private sector &mdash; heads would roll and companies  would go out of business. In public services, non-delivery of services  has been followed by inaction and more of the same. Under direct rule,  questions were answered with excuses. However, that was then; this is now.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The review of public administration (RPA) needs to be  completed as soon as possible. Health Service management must be given the  flexibility, authority and control required to make the necessary changes. More  staff need to be employed on front-line services, and they should be given the  backup that they need. In the Civil Service and public sector, the mantra  should be: if you are not serving a citizen; you had better be serving someone  who is.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We can no longer accept  that the weak and vulnerable in our society are provided with  desperately inadequate services. The people of Northern Ireland do not want to  hear lectures about finance and cost; they want efficiency and value for money.  Furthermore, public servants want to work in an efficient system that clearly  delivers for the people.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I recently became aware of an early years centre in  Ballynahinch, which is a centre of excellence for communications, particularly  for children, and others, who have communication difficulties. It is good that  such an organisation exists, and I draw the Minister&rsquo;s attention to it. The  centre is literally a one-stop shop and it has addressed some of the  difficulties that have been ongoing in the Department.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The people who attend the early years centre have severe  language and communication difficulties. One of centre&rsquo;s outputs is that 71% of  those children who attended the centre during their early years are now in  mainstream schools. It is important that children who are statemented become  involved in mainstream education and feel equal to others.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As well as providing specialist support for children, the I  CAN early years centre in Ballynahinch is a centre of excellence locally,  regionally and nationally and provides outreach support and training for early  years facilities across the South Eastern Education and Library Board. If that  project is the model of good practice, we must ensure that it continues and  that its sustainability is maintained. The support provided at the centre  should be rolled out across Northern    Ireland to allow all children to have equal  access to it.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Children cannot wait any longer, and they cannot wait for  RPA to be concluded before the services that they need are delivered. People  are aware that, in the short term, there will be an overspend pending  rationalisation under RPA. However, they would rather make that investment now  because they know that our children are worth it. They are also aware of the  long-term social and economic costs of not making that investment now.  Immediate action must be taken to provide better front-line services. We  already know what must be done. We need more speech and language therapists in  place. We must get our children the help that they need, and we must get it  done now.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In the recommendations from NICCY&rsquo;s &lsquo;Overview Report of  Speech and Language Therapy Provision in Northern Ireland 2004/05&rsquo;, the late  Children&rsquo;s Commissioner Nigel Williams stated that the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;should ensure that children&rsquo;s right to speech  and language therapy is accepted and prioritised by relevant Government  Departments and Commissioners and Providers of Service.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The report&rsquo;s most important recommendation is a fundamental  concern for parents &mdash; joined-up thinking:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The Ministers for  Health and Education should make this right a  reality by ensuring that policy, planning and service commissioning at a strategic level is strengthened to allow a  child centered approach to be developed which meets children&rsquo;s speech,  language, communication&hellip; needs.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">That is a crucial issue  for many people across Northern Ireland, some 21,000 of whom require access to speech and  language therapy, and that is not currently being achieved.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Parents who are now becoming part of the campaign do not  want other people to suffer the same difficulties that their own children have experienced, such as delays in  communication skills and delays in accessing adequate services.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that the Minister has good news to deliver today. To  deal with this issue effectively, joined-up thinking is required between the  health authorities and the bodies that  statement children &mdash; initially education and library boards. That must  be done as a matter of urgency. I commend the motion to the House.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>: I  welcome the opportunity to discuss the  motion. As with many other issues that we consider, the Assembly must  take the provision of speech and language therapy seriously. Although such  therapy is a particular specialism, it shares with other health services the  same traits of long waiting lists and lack of resources.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Speech and language  therapists undoubtedly undertake a much-needed and vital role, but the  current resources for the service cannot  meet the demand. That means that children  and young people are losing out on a most basic right to communicate  effectively. Given the pressure that has been put on our Assembly and Executive  to distribute finances accordingly to help to maintain services such as SLT, I  urge the Executive and the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public  Safety to consider carefully the funding for speech and language therapy.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Frustration at the current situation is shared not only by  the families of children and young people who are in need of SLT but by the  professionals who want to provide the best possible service. For the best  results, such children need regular sessions with a speech therapist. Families  should not be left waiting for inexcusable lengths of time. The therapy needs  to be administered effectively and  consistently over time. SLT involves constant attention and it requires  the freedom to be able to adapt the  situation to suit individual needs.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">A report from the Northern Ireland Commissioner for  Children and Young People highlighted that more than 2,000 children await an  initial SLT assessment and that some 3,400 who had already been assessed await  the commencement of their programmes. Those findings cannot be ignored, nor can  the needs of our children and young people. We must find efficient ways in  which to improve the situation. Can we further encourage collaboration between trusts and universities throughout Northern Ireland so that we reap  the benefits of having experienced and trained staff who can move into  speech and language therapy? How can we reduce waiting lists? We cannot judge demand on huge budgets without a  strategic plan for implementation. We must consider that issue before throwing  money at the problem and then failing to  see long-term improvements.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">SLT must meet the  distinctive needs of all those who require the service, including, for  example, autistic children and young people.  Such children should not have to go through years of their life without  the necessary support to communicate in the  best possible way. In too many cases, resources are just not available.  No one questions the quality of the therapy  that is provided, but we need to consider how we can improve and support  the service. We readily acknowledge the importance of SLT and call for further  work to be done to shed light on autism and to resource SLT. I support the  motion.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I suggest that, although  inequalities in provision exist throughout the various trust areas, there is a shortfall in provision across the North. That  is not the fault of, or as a direct  result of, speech and language therapists,  who do a great job in difficult circumstances.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As a mother of two small children, I know only too well the  stress and anxiety that all parents face when their child is ill or requires treatment. That some children must  wait for more than three years is appalling. Speech and language therapy is a  vital service that about 10% of all children in the Six Counties require, yet  access to the service and the time that a child must wait are, by and large,  determined by the postcode lottery that Pat Ramsey mentioned. Those children  who are most vulnerable and most in need usually face the longest waiting  times.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Speech and language therapy is an important service that  could be enhanced in many ways with a straight&shy;forward injection of cash from  the Department. We need to train and employ more speech and language therapists  to meet our higher levels of need. SLT is not a so-called soft service. During  a recent debate, the Minister told us that  mental-health services for children were seen as the poor relation, but  I believe that children&rsquo;s services in general have had a raw deal. Let us send  a clear message from today&rsquo;s debate that all services that children and young  people require will be properly resourced  and that we will listen to the concerns of those who are most aware of  where need exists. A recent report from the Northern Ireland Commissioner for  Children and Young People highlighted:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The overall lack of  action at a strategic and or policy level as regards the concerns raised by  NICCY, professionals in the field and parents/carers.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Those concerns have been ignored to date, but let  us change that from today. Let us listen to those who are well aware of the  services and needs in this area.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Without proper access to speech and language therapy, many  of our children are being condemned to a life of poor educational achievement.  That results in poor employment prospects, poor social skills development, low  self-esteem and emotional and behavioural problems. Early intervention by  speech and language therapists can help to prevent many of those problems and  increase the life chances of many children. Undoubtedly, that would be  cost-effective in the long term.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As a mother, I have focused on the positive impact that  speech and language therapy can have on children. However, many other people  could benefit from an enhanced speech and language therapy service &mdash; those with  communication difficulties, post-stroke sufferers, young offenders and people  with mental-health problems. The ability to communicate, which all Members take  for granted, is being denied to many people by failures to invest in speech and  language therapy. We must end that situation today. For that reason, I support  the motion. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Robert  Coulter</strong>: I congratulate the hon Members who tabled the motion. The issue of  speech and language therapy impacts heavily on many people across our land. I am chairman of the board of a  special school, so I know that such therapy can have a good impact on  children who receive it.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Royal College of  Speech and Language Therapists reckons that Northern Ireland has 57,000  preschool children who have speech, language and com&shy;munication needs. As many  as 5,500 of those children will have problems that persist into later life and  require specialist help. Such figures underline the importance of today&rsquo;s debate.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">This is a significant disability, and it may contribute to  other social problems, including the cycle of social exclusion, alienation and  offending. That is why the problem should be considered in the round and the  funding of services should be examined in the proper context, which includes  consideration of how much it costs society  in Northern Ireland  not to act on this issue. How much does society lose through not dealing  with the problem more effectively than it does at present?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly should commission  empirical research and a scoping exercise that defines the true extent  of the problem. Those should be followed by  an evaluation of what would happen if the present levels of speech,  language and communication needs were allowed to continue unabated. That would  produce a proper context for action.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is probably short-sighted to consider the provision of  an adequate response to speech, language and communication needs as simply  being another item in the health or education budgets. If early intervention  could alleviate the problems suffered by young offenders that in turn have led  to their offending behaviour, surely a case could be made for Budget savings to  be set aside for those offenders.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Members have mentioned the uneven level of care throughout  the Province, and that issue must be addressed. The phrase &ldquo;postcode lottery&rdquo;  has been used again and again, and it is also relevant to this argument. There  have been sub-regional differences in waiting times for referral, the  availability of sufficient therapy posts, the procedures for assessing  referrals, the provision of assistants to help the specialists and differing  care packages. A rational and even approach is needed across Northern Ireland  to address shortfalls in different  geographical regions and areas of provision.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The importance of early  intervention and, conversely, the dangers of late intervention are well  documented. Those dangers include: developmental disadvantage; damage to social  skills and employment prospects; educational underachievement; emotional  problems; and behavioural problems. All those dangers must figure in the  downside costs of inaction, which must be balanced against the actual costs of  improving the service to meet professionally led standards of adequacy. The net  cost can then be understood, and the relatively small amount of that net cost  will ultimately justify this much-needed reassessed public investment in this  important service.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">12.30 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">What worries me most is that, currently, there are no  speech and language therapy services for children and adolescents with  mental-health problems and for young offenders, and there is only limited  provision for patients suffering from brain injuries, cancer, voice conditions,  and strokes, and for secondary-school children and children with Asperger&rsquo;s  syndrome.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">All of that is a reproach to us. We must look not only at  the net cost approach that I have outlined, but at better, more innovative ways  of spending the current budget. I support the motion.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>: I welcome the motion; it raises a significant issue. However,  the motion does not indicate where the &ldquo;adequate and equitable resources&rdquo; it  calls for are to come from. As Dr Coulter rightly says, debate around the issue  suffers from a lack of statistics.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The scale of the problem is indicated primarily by concerns  raised by health professionals, rather than bare statistics. The figures  indicate that this time last year, of 17,000 children requiring speech and  language therapy, approximately 15,000 were receiving it. That means that nearly  15% of children who needed the therapy were not receiving it. Overall,  approximately 3,500 children and adults who have been assessed and require treatment are still awaiting it. Those  are the figures that the Alliance Party has researched. I did not understand the figure that Dr Coulter gave of  57,000 pre-school children in need of  speech and language treatment.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As Mr Ramsey said, the evidence suggests that there is a  postcode lottery, which is also the case for many other services. The trend for  patients going from assessment to provision is declining in some areas. The gap  is typically a few months, but in some locations there is a wait of up to two  years between being assessed as requiring therapy and actually receiving it.  That is particularly unacceptable for children. It is intolerable that a  six-year-old child should have to wait until he is eight to receive treatment.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We need to be cautious that our attempts to provide an  equitable service do not result in a reduction of the level of provision in  high performing areas. The task is to bring every trust area up to the standard  of the best, not to equalise the level of treatment to an average. Our  objective of speeding up access to therapy should not lead to any reduction in  the quality of the therapy provided. Requirements can differ significantly, so  it is not enough to illustrate the issue with mere statistics.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Resources and financial support also require some thought.  Fewer speech and language therapists qualify than  are needed. I would like to know what the position is across the whole of the UK, and Ireland. Anecdotally, it  seems that Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  school-leavers are going elsewhere to train. If that is the case, why is it so?  Is there any way of encouraging them back?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Discussion on this issue has focused on the regional task  force. However, the electorate has already become a bit fed up with &ldquo;government  by review&rdquo;, and &ldquo;government by task force&rdquo;. Executive action is required via  cross-cutting policies to ensure all of the following: that finances are  available; that enough therapists become qualified; that the public is properly  informed about the availability of speech and language therapy assessment and provision; that underperforming trusts  are brought up to the level of the highest performers; and that children  requiring therapy are identified as soon as possible.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We welcome the motion as it stands, as a great start. The  Executive now faces the challenges of finding where the inequalities in speech  and language therapy exist, clarifying exactly what equitable resources are  needed, and locating adequate funding.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The determination to waste money on segregated services brings a high cost for other areas; the  Executive has four years to examine that. Nevertheless, the Alliance  Party supports the motion.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  I congratulate the hon Members for proposing the motion. As the DUP health  spokes&shy;person I had the privilege, just over a year ago, of hosting a reception  in the Long Gallery to celebrate the diamond jubilee of the Royal College of  Speech and Language Therapists. Those individuals make a hugely important  contribution to healthcare in our Province.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As with all the allied health professionals, there are  stringent resource limitations on what staff can achieve. Retention of people undergoing  training has been a problem, and I am encouraged to see that the numbers of new  speech and language therapists commencing work in the Province is growing  gradually &mdash; that is to be welcomed.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Significant financial incentives have been attracting newly  trained professionals to practice elsewhere; and they cannot be blamed for  following that course, because people outside the Province appear to value  their exemplary credentials more than we do. I am not sure of the current  figure, but recently there were 20 vacancies in Northern Ireland. It has always  been difficult to obtain from Ministers precise figures for the waiting times  of those seeking speech and language assessment or treatment. Ministers have  only been able to provide the length of  waits experienced by those who received an initial assessment in the  previous quarter.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">A cynic might conclude that that situation could be useful  to the Department in limiting negative media headlines. It cannot be difficult  to obtain the waiting list for assessment or treatment across the Province, and  the point was referred to in NICCY&rsquo;s follow-up report in 2006, which states:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;There continues to be great difficulty accessing  information uniformly across Trusts. It would appear that information &hellip;  critical to effective service planning is not yet routinely collated analysed,  or easily accessible. The urgent need to address this deficiency cannot be  over-stated.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I appeal to the Minister to address the problem urgently.  Precise numbers must be obtained so that proper resource planning can be put  into effect.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There have been marked disparities in different parts of  the Province. Waiting times are not the staff&rsquo;s fault: they do as much as can  reasonably be expected. Unlike other disciplines, waiting list figures for speech  and language therapy encompass adults and children. Long waits are particularly  significant for children, as many of them are at an important stage in their  development.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Vacancies and pressures on special schools also pose  particular difficulties. I am aware of great problems at Torbank School,  which is in my own constituency, and I wish to highlight the need for an urgent  look at that school&rsquo;s needs.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">One third of young people with special educational needs is  statemented with speech and language needs. In order to improve that situation,  the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety and the Department  of Education must work together in a close and cohesive format.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In 2002, the comprehensive review of the speech and  language therapy workforce highlighted the need for more posts and to encourage  trained staff to remain in the Province. A year ago there were 314&middot;4 whole-time  equivalent speech and language therapists in the Province, as well as another  six full-time and 22 part-time support staff.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The workforce is overwhelmingly female: there are only two  full-time and one part-time male therapists. The NICCY follow-up report states  that more than 2,000 individuals were awaiting assessment with approximately  3,500 who had been assessed but were waiting for their treatment to start.  Across Northern Ireland,  over 15,500 patients were receiving treatment, which meant that to provide  treatment for all those who need it the capacity of the service would have to  increase by more than one third.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Recently, 11 out of the 14 health trusts reported having  inadequate financial resources for speech and language therapists. Many were  also concerned about limited clerical and administrative staff and ineffective  appointment systems. I support the motion.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McKay</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the SDLP Members who tabled  the motion, which I support.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in recognises the important role that speech and  language therapists and support workers play in the lives of many people with  communication, eating, drinking and  swallowing problems. Speech and language therapists provide an essential  service in the Health Service for both children and adults. Not only do they  assist and work with people with communication difficulties but they help to instil  confidence in those people to express themselves to the best of their ability.  There is clearly inadequate and inequitable service provision in the sector  across the Six Counties. That needs to be acted on urgently.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Commissioner for Children and Young People&rsquo;s follow-up review of speech and language therapy  services for children and young people for 2005-06 showed that, from  available information, 5,457 children and young people were awaiting assessment  and/or speech and language therapy.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">For assessments, the review states:</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText"><span style="font-size:8.5pt; ">&ldquo;the maximum wait stated by  any Trust for community settings was just over 10 months&rdquo;.</span></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The figure was even worse for waiting times for therapy.  The maximum waiting time recorded between assessment and therapy was 24 months  &mdash; two years. That was recorded in the  former Homefirst Community Health and Social Services Trust area, which  takes in part of my constituency of North Antrim.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The geographical inequity in the service is extraordinary.  Waiting times for assessment last year ranged from three weeks in one trust  area to five months in another. Waiting times from referral to therapy range  from 15 weeks to 29 months.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Last year, 11 of the 14 trusts identified:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;inadequate financial  resources and/or speech and language therapists&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText" style="text-indent:0cm;">as reasons for the failure to meet  need. The recognised shortage of speech and language therapists is caused by  recruitment and retention problems, and that means that many clients,  particularly children, experience severe delays in accessing therapy.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in calls on the Minister to make the service more equitable across the board and to end the  postcode lottery that currently exists in the sector. There is a  pressing need to ensure that appropriate financial resources and more speech  and language therapists are provided. The need that exists for speech and  language therapists looks set to grow even more. That is why the Minister  should approach the problem with a degree of urgency in order to get it  addressed now.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There is greater need for speech and language therapy  intervention for a number of reasons. People live longer, and many now live  longer after cancer treatment. People with dementia or who have suffered a  stroke &mdash; conditions that affect communication &mdash; need assistance. Problems such  as autism and learning difficulty are more widely recognised. Improvements in  neonatal care mean that survival rates for preterm babies with developmental  problems such as cerebral palsy is increasing. Children are losing out on vital  treatment, and that is simply not good enough.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">If the opportunity is missed for children and young people  to avail themselves of speech and language therapy services, that could have a  huge effect on their development. The longer that it is left, the more  difficult it will be to address some of those difficulties.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Go raibh maith agat.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Simpson</strong>:  I also congratulate Pat Ramsey and Dominic Bradley on their motion.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">A recent review of speech and language therapy services by  the Commissioner for Children and Young People showed that some 20,000 children  require, or currently receive, speech and  language therapy services in the Province. The findings of the then  Children&rsquo;s Commissioner, Nigel Williams, were shocking.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In some trust areas, children and young people were forced  to wait for up to 18 months to two years to be assessed by a speech and  language therapist. A clear inequality exists in waiting times from the date of  the referral to the first assessment. The whereabouts of a child or a young  person in Northern Ireland  seems to determine how long he or she must wait for speech and language  therapy. I know that from experience in my constituency. Waiting times for  pupils at Ceara School  in Lurgan, for example, are much longer than those for pupils at Donard School  in Banbridge.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I have nothing but admiration for the dedication and work  of the diligent staff at all those schools in Upper Bann, especially the  principal of Ceara School, Dr Peter Cunningham, and Mrs Freda Wylie at Donard School,  who will be retiring next Tuesday after many years at the school. Those years  of dedication must be commended.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">12.45 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We asked direct rule Ministers for details on how many  patients and young people were awaiting speech and language therapy  appointments and the duration of those  waits, but we were told that the statistics were not available; they  were not kept. That is not good enough. To plan for the future, we must know  how many individuals require services, but  we are merely provided with general information on the duration of wait  experienced by those who have been treated in the previous quarter. For  instance, 18 months ago, more than 650  individuals in the southern health area received initial speech and  language therapy assessments; 255 had waited more than three months, and 30 had  waited over six months. Many of those requiring treatment are young children,  and such waits for therapy can have a major impact on their development.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Commissioner for Children and Young People&rsquo;s report of  2005 made several recommendations. It called for the establishment of a  regional task force to address the postcode lottery that exists in service  provision and an agreed maximum waiting time for assessment and therapy. A  follow-up review by the Office of the Commissioner for Children and Young  People took place in 2006, which identified that some trusts had made positive  improvements. However, that was not universal across the Province, and there  was evidence that some waiting lists for assessment and therapy had increased &mdash;  for instance, the number of children awaiting assessment in the Sperrin  Lakeland Health and Social Care Trust had increased by 28&middot;3%.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Eventually in 2006,  direct rule Minister Lord Rooker announced that the task force  recommended by the Commissioner for Children and Young People would be  established. The task force met for the first time last year, but, to date, it  has not published a report. Even though  some investment has been announced, it does not address the postcode  lottery or the ability of principals of special schools to access services  directly for pupils.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Many children in Northern Ireland need access to,  and suitable provision of, speech and language therapy. The current allocation  of resources, structures of service delivery and lack of interest on the part  of the Government in addressing that means that children and young people who  have speech and language difficulties are being denied their basic rights.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Government officials  tell us that there are not enough therapists because they drop out from  their courses, or because there is no funding or insufficient funding available  for them &mdash; or a mixture of all three. Perhaps the Minister will tell the House  why that is so. I support the motion.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Approximately 2&middot;5 million people in the UK have communication problems.  Speech, language and communication difficulties are the most common disabilities presenting in early  childhood. This year, the Education Select Committee at Westminster acknowledged  that as the number of children with special needs rises, so does the  incidence of communication problems.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The statistics relating to children with special needs  demonstrate the extent of the problem in this country: up to 90% of children  with learning disabilities have speech and language difficulties; approximately  80% of those who have severe learning disabilities do not acquire effective  speech; 62% of children with mental-health disorders have speech and language  difficulties; and 5% to 8% of preschool children with speech, language or  communication problems and 10% of school-age children have communication  problems. Furthermore, over one third of stroke sufferers have persisting speech, language and communication  problems; more than three quarters  of the people who have mental-health disorders have communication  difficulties; and almost two thirds of young offenders have speech and language  impairment or communication needs. Unfortunately, the list goes on.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Speech and language therapists provide an invaluable  service in Northern Ireland, so there are serious risks to patients if speech  and language therapists are not availed of, or applied for, when needed.  Children with delay and communication difficulties are an exceptionally  high-risk group with high rates of later developmental disadvantages.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Difficulties can arise with social skills and behavioural  and emotional problems, which can lead to poor employment prospects. One third  of children with communication problems, if untreated, will go on to develop  mental illness, which will result in involvement in criminal activity in over  50% of cases.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The importance of the service that speech and language therapists provide is realised when we  examine the extent of the need for their services in Northern Ireland.  Statistics provided by the health trusts reveal that over 15,000 children and  young people are currently receiving speech and language therapy in Northern Ireland,  while a further 2,000 are awaiting assessment for therapy. Those individuals  can experience delays of up to 24 months between assessment and receipt of  therapy. Average delays range from, at best, two and a half weeks to, at worst,  9 months. That is clearly unacceptable, given the identified need of those  children and young people.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">When considered together, those figures reveal that well  over 5,000 children and young people are still awaiting assessment and/or  therapy. Up to 21,000 children and young people, therefore, require access to  speech and language therapy in Northern    Ireland. The Assembly must act to address  this inadequate provision. The facts and figures speak for themselves. I un&shy;conditionally  support the motion and commend its proposer.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I  declare an interest in this matter as a member of the New Horizon Sure Start  committee, which operates in Carrickfergus and Larne and is a potential  recipient of funding to address the speech and language therapy needs of  children in the area.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Much is made in education debates of the large number of  young people leaving school with limited literacy and numeracy skills. The  Royal College of Speech and Language  Therapists advises that in Northern Ireland there may be as many as 57,000 preschool children  with speech, language and communication skill needs. If a child at preschool  stage or at school has such a need and it is not addressed, how can we expect  him or her to realise their full potential? How can a teacher cross that  barrier and communicate effectively with the child? Likewise, how can the child  connect with the teacher or have his or her queries answered? This is a major  problem that ultimately affects the education of young children. It also  affects their social lives as they try to mix with others, even in their own  homes.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Other Members have commented on the Northern Ireland Commissioner for Children and Young People&rsquo;s  report on speech and language therapy provision for 2004-05 and his follow-up  report, which was launched last March. The follow-up report showed that 2,055 children and young people were waiting for  assessment. Yes, it was a 17&middot;4% drop on the previous figure, but does  that simply reflect an increase in the number of children and young people who  had been assessed but had yet to receive therapy? Children and young people  must go through a number of lists before they start to receive the treatment  that they need.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The report showed that 3,402 people in Northern Ireland  were waiting to start therapy. As others have said, children and young people  faced a delay of up to 24 months in the former Homefirst Community Health and  Social Services Trust area, which covers my constituency of East Antrim &mdash;  including Larne, Carrickfergus and part of Newtownabbey.  That is unacceptable; it is ruining young  people&rsquo;s potential, and that gross inequality must be addressed. Yet, we  are told that, in other areas, the delay between assessment and receipt of  therapy can be as little as two and a half weeks. Why should children and young  people in my area be exposed to such a  postcode lottery defect? Why is there such gross inequality in Northern Ireland?  It is unfair, and it is ruining their potential in life.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Worringly, the NICCY  report on speech and language therapy  provision showed that, compared with previous years, more trusts  complained of inadequate financial resources,  a shortage of speech and language therapists, a lack of administrative support and lengthening waiting lists.  It was clear that by March 2006, when the report was published, that that  situation was worsening.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Other Members mentioned the regional task force that was  set up in March 2006 by Lord Rooker, the then Minister with responsibility for  children and young people, to review speech and language therapy services. Who  are the members of that task force and how often has it met? I am led to  believe that it has met once, but a lack of clarity exists. Given the new  structures in place in Northern    Ireland, to whom does that regional task  force report? It is important that those questions are answered and that  ministerial responsibility is assumed, so that progress can be made and lessons  can be learned that will improve the lives of children and young people in Northern Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">When are we going to hear of any recommendations by the regional task force? When will it produce a  report? One of my constituents had been on a waiting list for 13 months, only to receive a 20-minute assessment  from a locum who did not have the notes from previous assessments that  other professionals had conducted. As a result of intervention, my constituent  has commenced an eight-week therapy course, but what happens then? What ongoing  support is available? Difficulties such as those that I have described cannot  be cured in eight weeks. Those problems must be solved, and I hope that the Minister of Health, Social Services and  Public Safety will help to solve them and improve the defects in the  system. We must improve our young people&rsquo;s lives.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. Members will know that the Business Committee has arranged  to meet immediately upon the lunchtime suspension. I propose therefore, by  leave of the Assembly, to suspend the sitting until 2.00 pm.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The sitting was suspended at 12.57 pm.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">&nbsp;On resuming  (Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Dallat] in the Chair) &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">2.00 pm</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The sitting is resumed. We shall continue the debate on the  provision of speech and language therapy.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr McGimpsey)</strong>: I thank Mr Ramsey  for bringing this important issue to the  House. I am aware that he has raised it with the Department on several  occasions with regard to his constituency of Foyle.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I acknowledge the problems that there have been with the  provision of speech and language therapy, particularly  with regard to the excessive and unacceptable waiting times for  assessment and treatment. I assure the House that I am focused on the issue,  and improvements will be seen in the near future.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to outline some of the initiatives that the  Department is considering. I recognise that the ability to communicate gives  children and young people the capacity to participate fully in society. Without  the correct assistance, children who have communication difficulties are likely  to experience significant long-term educational, economic, social and health  ill-effects. That is why I am keen to ensure that everyone who needs speech and  language therapy has access to the appropriate services.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">My Department has been  working in close partnership with  the Department of Education to ensure that children and young people  receive the therapy that meets their needs and, consequently, improves their  life chances. That type of co-ordinated partnership between Govern&shy;ment and agencies is recognised by all who are  involved in speech and language therapy provision as the most effective  way forward for the planning, commissioning and delivery of services.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">An increasing number of children and young people who have  speech, language and communication difficulties are seeking help from the  health and social services and early education organisations in Northern Ireland.  Many of those children also have complex needs and medical conditions that are  associated with those needs. Recent national research shows that approximately  10% of school-age children have communication problems and up to 90% of  children who have learning disabilities have speech and communication  difficulties. The fundamental service review of special education, which reported  in March 2003, showed that the number of schoolchildren who have special  educational needs increased by 70% between 1991 and 2001. Those statistics show  that pressure on speech and language therapy services throughout Northern Ireland  has increased. My Department is working towards tackling that need.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The former Northern    Ireland Commissioner for Children and Young  People recommended the establishment of a  regional speech and language therapy task force, and that was  established in September 2006. The commissioner  produced two reports, one in 2004-05 and the other in 2005-06. The  reports identified gaps in service provision and highlighted inequity in  waiting times for assessment and resultant therapy across Northern Ireland.  The task force comprises service users and a wide spectrum of people who are  responsible for the policy and delivery of speech and language therapy. Its  role is to review the provision of speech and language therapy in Northern Ireland.  Working groups have been set up to investigate the key issues that were raised  in both the commissioner&rsquo;s reports.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The task force will produce an action plan and will report  its findings in December 2007 after a period of consultation. Part of the  reason for the delay in the task force&rsquo;s work is the death of its chairperson,  Dr Pamela Hannigan, on 2 March 2007. The task force usually meets every month,  but has not done so for the past three months. I expect that a new chairperson  will take up position in June. Pamela Hannigan was the driving force behind the  task force. The task force, and indeed the sector, has clearly lost a very  important champion.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It was anticipated that the task force would report in  June, but it will now report to me in December, though subgroups have  continued, and will continue, to meet. The task force will report after  consultation with me in December 2007. It will focus on reducing waiting lists  across Northern Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In response to the NICCY reports, all health and social  care trusts have agreed new access targets from 25 May 2007, including targets for speech and language therapy.  The new targets will comprise maximum waiting times for access to services,  assessment and treatment of 26 weeks by March 2008, falling to 13 weeks by  March 2009. The trusts have already started work on implementation plans to  meet the targets, which are a requirement of the trusts in an effort to address  assessment and waiting times.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As well as the task force and the new waiting-list targets,  I confirm that significant additional funding has been provided for speech and  language therapy. Research demonstrates that early identification and  intervention are essential to support the optimum physical, cognitive and  social development of children with speech, language and communication  difficulties. Early access to speech and  language therapy for children in  education can significantly improve academic ability and employability  in later life.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In recognition of the importance of such early  intervention, the children and young people&rsquo;s funding package, announced in  March 2006, amounted to &pound;4 million to set up  nine early-intervention multidisciplinary teams to work in extended  school and other early years settings. Those teams are being recruited in the  five health and social care trusts, and they will include speech and language  therapists who will help to provide early assessments and interventions.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">A working group has also  been established, comprising members from the trusts, my Department and  the Department of Education, to ensure that the teams are effective and make  the most of available resources.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I also confirm that an additional &pound;1 million has been made available for speech and language therapy  through the children and young  people&rsquo;s funding package, which will come on line in mid-2007: and, to  address Mr Ramsey&rsquo;s point, that money will  not just be for children in special needs schools. The additional  resources will be used to drive down further the length of time that children  and young people have to wait for assessment and therapy.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Recognising the need for additional speech and language  therapists to meet increasing demand, my Department has provided funding for  the training of additional therapists in the University of Ulster.  The cost of training a speech and language therapy student for three years is in  the region of &pound;30,000. The Department normally commissions 30 places for  training, but from 2001 funding was provided for an additional 10 student  places, and that was increased in 2003 to an additional 15 places. There are  currently 110 students in place. Those initiatives are being implemented by the  Department to try to address the problems that we all understand and accept  exist.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Ramsey referred to examples of good working practice.  The Western Health and Social Care Trust area, which includes the former  Sperrin Lakeland Trust, introduced a care aims model in October 2005. That was  a radical redesign of the service, which enabled assessment and treatment to  take place at the same time, and it has reduced waiting times for treatment in  the area from what could have been up to 17 months to zero. Currently there are  no waiting lists for treatment in that area. It is anticipated that that good  practice will be replicated in the Foyle area where similar results are hoped  for. The Department wants to try to address the unacceptable waiting lists in  Mr Ramsey&rsquo;s area.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The introduction of speech and language therapy assistants  in many trust areas is another example of good practice. The assistants free  the therapists from routine tasks, enabling them to devote more time to assessments and interventions. Following an  assessment by a speech and language therapist, assistants can often  deliver programmes to children with special needs in both special and  mainstream schools.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The introduction of that mix of skills has had a  significant impact on service delivery. Speech and language therapists provide  advice to teachers and classroom assistants on measures that they can take to  incorporate therapy into lessons. The two ongoing pilot projects being run by Sure Start in the Down and Lisburn area of  the new Eastern Health and Social Care Trust demonstrate the benefits of that.  The projects involve teachers and classroom assistants providing basic therapy  while trained therapists provide support, but are free to concentrate on  children with more complex needs. Owing to the success of those projects to  date, the trust is considering introducing similar schemes in all its nursery  schools.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I recognise the success of other initiatives in helping to improve the provision of speech and language  therapy in Northern    Ireland. The success has been achieved  through working in partnership, the importance of which cannot be  underestimated in helping to deliver integrated and planned services at an  operational level.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Other examples of good practice in Northern Ireland  demonstrate effective and co-ordinated planning approaches. Those include the  language and learning project in the Northern Health and Social Care Trust area  and the wraparound scheme operated by the Southern Health and Social Services  Board. Those projects identified significantly improved social, health and educational outcomes for children when services  are provided through a high-quality  multi-agency approach.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The task force also investigated evidence of good practice  in other areas of the UK,  such as Scotland and Wales, which it  will use to inform its thinking when producing its report. It will examine ways  of main&shy;streaming good practice to include the delivery of speech and language  therapy services in Northern    Ireland. The Department of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety and the Department of Education will jointly  consider the task force&rsquo;s recommendations to determine the way forward for the  provision of speech and language therapy.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">My Department will continue to work in close partnership  with other Departments, the statutory sector and the voluntary and community  sector to ensure that the most appropriate speech and language therapy services  are available to all who require access to them across Northern Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am committed to improving service provision, and I look  forward to reading the recommendations of the task force in December 2007. I  intend to demonstrate that I am not satisfied with past or current service  provision and to ensure future equality of access throughout Northern Ireland.  In consultation with others, I will give the  matter the focus required to ensure a satisfactory outcome for those  requiring speech and language therapy services.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. T&aacute; &aacute;thas orm achoimri&uacute; a dh&eacute;anamh  ar an mh&eacute;id a d&uacute;radh sa d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht go dt&iacute;  seo. I am pleased to make the winding-up speech on today&rsquo;s debate. As  Members have said, language is vital to all aspects of development throughout  life. Therefore, the provision of proper  speech and language services is vital. Members&rsquo; contributions to the  debate reflect their concern to ensure that such services are available to all  those who need them, without undue delay. My colleague Mr Ramsey highlighted  the situation in the Western Health Board area. He said that: &ldquo;over half the  children who required assessment or speech therapy in the Western Health and  Social Services Board area could not access those services.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">He also mentioned, as  did other Members, the findings of the NICCY report, which concluded  that there is a postcode lottery. In other words, the area in which a person  lives has a huge bearing on the expected wait for assessment and treatment &mdash;  something that was also mentioned by Mrs O&rsquo;Neill, Rev Robert Coulter, Mr Lunn,  Mr McKay, Mr Beggs and Mr Simpson. The postcode lottery is a major theme that  has emerged from the debate and one that, I am sure, the Minister will heed. He  has outlined some of the measures that he is undertaking to alleviate the  situation.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Ramsey also  mentioned one of the core problems in  proper service provision &mdash; the difficulty in recruiting and retaining  staff. He underlined the need to get the resources to where they are needed &mdash;  that is, on the front line. Mrs Robinson,  and other Members, mentioned the fact that trained speech and language  therapists find it more rewarding to work in other jurisdictions because the  remuneration for their expertise and work is greater. That is something that  the Minister will have to take on board as well.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Easton stated that current resources do not meet demand. He referred to the frustration shared by  children who are waiting on services and the therapists who are waiting  to provide those services. Members have heard that 2,000 children are awaiting  assessment, according to the NICCY report. Mrs O&rsquo;Neill mentioned the shortfalls  across Northern Ireland  with waiting times of up to three years. She suggested a straightforward  injection of cash and added that the debate should send out a clear message  that proper resources for children and young people services should be made  available.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Rev Robert Coulter mentioned a figure of 57,000 preschool  children with speech and language needs. That is an alarming statistic. He  mentioned that 5,500 of those young people continue to have communication  difficulties throughout their lives and talked about the impact that those  difficulties have on their lives &mdash; about the social exclusion. He asked how  much more it would cost not to act to remedy the situation. He called for research into the causes of the problem and  the most effective ways of dealing with it. He also mentioned the  necessity to evaluate the impact of any action that is taken.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Rev Robert Coulter underlined the need for early intervention, referring to its benefits and the  difficulties caused by late intervention. He also referred to the uneven  level of care throughout Northern    Ireland, and once again the postcode lottery  was mentioned. Mrs Robinson highlighted the fact that there are now more speech  and language therapists in Northern    Ireland than there were previously, and the  Minister outlined some of the steps that have been taken to ensure that that is  the case. However, there remain 20 vacancies to be filled. That points to the  need to make the work of speech and language therapists, and the reward for it,  more attractive than it is at present. We need more therapists, and we need to  retain them in the service.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Several Members  referred to the difficulties that they have had in the past, and more  recently, in obtaining information and statistics about waiting lists and the  service in general. The NICCY report called for information to be co-ordinated  in a more useful way so that it is easily available to those who require it.  David Simpson referred to that issue, on which I hope the Minister will take  action. It is important that the information that is required from Government  Departments by public representatives and experts in the field is readily  available.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Daith&iacute; McKay underlined  the unevenness of provision across Northern Ireland,  referring to the effect that a lack of intervention can have on  children&rsquo;s development, on their employment prospects, and on their educational  development. The ability to communicate is important; it affects every aspect  of a person&rsquo;s life. Therefore, I emphasise, once more, the need for early  intervention.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am grateful to the Minister for attending the debate and  for listening carefully to the points that were raised by Members. He outlined  in some detail the action that is being  taken by his Department to remedy the situation. I am aware that the  Minister has been in the Chamber for quite a number of debates &mdash; he is possibly  close to holding the record for debates attended by a Minister &mdash; and we appreciate his presence. He has  acknowledged the difficulties in the system at the moment with waiting  times, which he said were unacceptable, and he informed the House that his  Department is focused on alleviating that situation.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister acknowledged that help with com&shy;munication and  speech difficulties offers children the capacity to participate fully in their  education, and he said that he will take action to ensure access to appropriate  services. He cited some examples of good practice. I wish to add to those  examples by praising the work that is being done by the education and library  boards. Speech therapists work with primary 1 teachers in the classroom to deal  with speech and communication problems on the spot. That is an excellent  example of early intervention, and it also helps to build the capacity of the  primary 1 teacher to recognise and identify difficulties, and to intervene and  deal with them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister outlined quite a few measures that are being  taken by his Department, and I am sure that all Members will join me in  welcoming those. However, we also look forward to the task force beginning its  work again, following some difficult circumstances, which we all acknowledge.  We look forward to the task force reporting to the Minister and contributing to  the dissemination of good practice.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Please bring your remarks to a close.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly notes the inequalities in the provision of  speech and language therapy throughout Northern Ireland, and calls on the  Executive to provide adequate and equitable resources and financial support.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr McClarty] in the Chair)</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Commissioner for Older People</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour and 30  minutes for the debate. The proposer of the motion will have 10 minutes to  propose and 10 minutes for the winding-up speech. All other Members will have  five minutes.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly calls  upon the Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister to prioritise,  as a matter of urgency, the appointment of a Commissioner for Older People, as  previously supported by the Transitional Assembly.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I await the wrath of the Minister of Finance and <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt; ">Personnel for proposing the motion. However, our  older</span> people&rsquo;s welfare is worth more than a few columns in local  newspapers, so I make no apology. I remind the Minister that his party tabled  the same motion in the Transitional Assembly less than six months ago, and I  want to see it expedited today. That motion received cross-party support, so I  hope for no less now.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Why does Northern    Ireland need a commissioner for older  people? It needs one because our population is ageing, with older people fast  becoming the largest population sector in Northern Ireland. The 2001 census  recorded that 296,000 people of pensionable age were living in Northern Ireland.  That amounted to 16% of the population. As that census was taken six years ago,  those figures will have increased. Furthermore, by 2017, it is projected that  22% of the population will be aged 60 and over, a figure that is expected to  increase to 30% by 2036.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In my constituency of Foyle, more than 13% are pensioners.  The majority of those people face daily problems without having a champion to  turn to who could insist on legislative changes, or even ensure that current  legislation is being adhered to properly. A commissioner could act  independently, while working with the relevant authorities. There would be none  of the conflict of interest that could arise if a civil or public servant were  charged with the responsibility.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We should not forget the Trojan work that agencies such as  Help the Aged and Age Concern, to mention but two, have done to champion the  rights of older people. Their work has been invaluable, but because such  agencies lack legislative authority, they are restricted in what they can do.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">What has the Department been doing to help older people in Northern Ireland?  The publication in 2005 of a strategy titled &lsquo;Ageing in an Inclusive Society:  Promoting the Social Inclusion of Older People&rsquo; has yet to make any significant  impact. To my knowledge, we are still waiting on a community safety strategy  for older people, yet our counterparts in Wales  &mdash; to be <span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt; ">followed by Scotland &mdash; have  appointed a Commissioner</span> for Older People. The Secretary of State, Peter  Hain, was instrumental in delivering that post for Wales. However, I presume that he  was too busy appeasing political agendas to be bothered with ensuring a decent  human-rights provision for the older people of Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Pensioner poverty is increasing, although the state pension  is not. Fuel poverty, and its effects on older people, cannot be ignored. Of  the homes that suffer from fuel poverty, 44% are occupied by those of  retirement age and above. I am particularly pleased that the Minister for  Social Development has deemed the issue of fuel poverty to be one of her key  priorities.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Deaths of older people are obviously more common in the  colder months: in 2004-05, 1,280 deaths were cold-related, with the vast  majority of those older people. The numbers increase each year, mainly due to  the effects of fuel poverty. Problems of isolation and a lack of community care  are other factors. Unfortunately, the number of deaths will continue to rise  until a Department with legislative powers to make genuine changes comes into  being. Of the &pound;7&middot;5 million of additional resources to tackle fuel poverty in  the Chancellor of the Exchequer&rsquo;s pre-Budget statement, a meagre &pound;1&middot;2 million  is for the devolved regions.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent"><span style="letter-spacing:-.05pt; ">That is  something that a commissioner for older peopl</span>e, acting in conjunction  with the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, could  investigate and use to bring pressure to bear on the Assembly.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">2.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members may do all that we can &mdash; we can debate all sorts of  issues pertaining to older people &mdash; but we still leave the Chamber having had  little effect on the issues that affect their lives. A commissioner would have  the teeth to bring forward the desired effect. The steady progress of the  children&rsquo;s commissioner since the initial appointment in 2003 is proof of that  for all to see. Children make up 30% of the population; that was deemed high  enough to justify the appointment of a commissioner. The percentage of older  people is fast approaching that figure. Members must get their act together and  provide that section of the community with the funding necessary to appoint a  champion with the legislative powers to see that those people are not only heard  but, more importantly, valued.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText"><span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt; ">In less than 20 years,  demographic changes will dicta</span>te that policies and programmes will have  to reflect the needs of an ever-ageing society. Just because people get older  does not mean that they become part of a throwaway society in which they are  the commodity that is dumped. Humans are non-recyclable; we each have one  chance at life. In the early years, the majority of us can depend on parents  and family to take care of us. However, in later years, older people are pushed  aside, pushed about, abused and tortured by those who are charged with the  responsibility of looking after them. A commissioner could help to eradicate  that type of activity. Elder abuse is an unpublicised crime, and it could be made less frequent with the proper  legislation. If older people had an  appropriate person or Department to confide in, things would eventually  change.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Discrimination is  frequently highlighted in all aspects of daily life. However, there is  much less outrage about ageism, which is considered less of a priority among  employers. Free travel is an example of how females of pension age are denied  their rights. Although in receipt of a  state pension, they must wait until age 65 to avail of the concessionary  travel scheme. That restricts the activities of females who are in good enough  health and want to avail of the scheme to travel widely. Yet, they must stand  by, demoralised and disenfranchised by a Government policy that makes no sense.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Wales  has got it right. The Welsh Assembly has listened, considered and delivered.  Its strategy reflects the United Nations Principles for Older Persons, which  promote positive images of ageing and give older members of society a true  voice. The role of the Commissioner for Older People in Wales is not simply  that of a caretaker, but rather of an active agent with the power to establish  and review policy and to empower those who feel vulnerable or lack the  confidence to stand up for themselves.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That Members are concentrating on older people and the  associated challenges does not mean that we are dismissive of the issues and  difficulties that affect other sections of society. However, if Members can get  it right for one part of society, then the entire society will benefit. Older  people are more likely to vote, and it is  likely that a substantial percentage of each Member&rsquo;s votes come from  them. Clearly, older people want their voices to be heard and expect some  action based on what they say.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Existing Government policies are neither sufficient nor  effective. The same statements and strategies are referred to in news reports,  but that must change. Members know the drill by now. We were put here to make  changes &mdash; to make life better for all sections of all the communities in Northern Ireland.  I urge Members to give the motion their full support. In the words of one of Derry&rsquo;s famous sons: &ldquo;Things can only get better.&rdquo; Older  people have rights too.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>:  We are all familiar with the concept of commissioners  &mdash; persons who are appointed at various levels to oversee aspects of governmental administration &mdash; in  global and European contexts, and in the various parts of the United Kingdom.  Those commissioners deal with areas as diverse as international human rights,  refugees, facets of European policy, racial equality, the protection of  children, sustainable government and data protection.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission ensures that  citizens receive equal, full and firm protection in law. The Commissioner for  Complaints in the office of the Northern  Ireland Ombudsman is charged, as part of his brief, with investigating  injustices that are due to maladministration in government.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Independent  Monitoring Commission is charged with  helping to promote the establishment of stable and inclusive government  in a peaceful Northern    Ireland. It reports on paramilitary  activity, the so-called normalisation process and complaints made by one party  against another party or parties in the Executive level of Government.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The appointments in Northern Ireland of a Com&shy;missioner  for Children and Young People and of an Interim Commissioner for Victims and  Survivors have been warmly welcomed, and the sterling work that they have done  to date is widely acknowledged.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, there have been times when people may have felt  that appointed commissioners have failed to operate fairly and effectively in  the way that they approached their work or dealt with a particular matter. The  Patten Commission on policing would, for most unionists, be at the top of that  list. There are times when we might feel that we are overburdened with  commissions and commissioners but, by and large, the outcome of their work has  been to the benefit of the majority of the community.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Health and personal care for the elderly has already been  the focus of Members&rsquo; attention today, and I welcome the action that has been  proposed in those areas. However, there will always be specific areas of community life where we cannot depend entirely on  the bureaucratic structure to operate with sensitivity to the needs of people in an efficient and effective  way. In such cases, there are great  advantages in appointing a person who is charged with the responsibility  for the oversight of a specific area of public life to ensure the maximum  benefits for a particular section of the community.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">For that reason, I commend to the Assembly the appointment  of a commissioner with responsibility for the elderly &mdash; if that is the  politically correct term for those who need special attention just as urgently  as other groups in our community.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There was a time when life expectancy was much shorter, and  when those who lived their allotted threescore years and 10 were fewer in  number. Those who lived another decade were considered to have been specially  blessed. Many people today regard getting older as getting better and, in that  context, our First Minister is an inspiration to us all. For many people like  him, turning 60, 70 or 80 is just another milestone along the road in a busy  and healthy life.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, we are all aware that a considerable proportion of  older people do not enjoy good health, or live in suitable accommodation or  have sufficient income or resources to meet the needs of daily living. They may  also lack the ability or understanding to access the benefits system.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are many older folk who lack independence and who  have problems with loneliness and isolation, and with employment and pension  issues. Some have no access to, or ability to cope with, the technology that  benefits many in our society today. They have problems with mobility, tax and  inheritance matters, and many other issues.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That mature section of our community is made up of people  who have, through thick and thin, held this Province  together over the past 40 years of the Troubles. Their lives were  blighted by terrorism and instability, yet, they often do not arrive in the  safe harbour that they might reasonably expect to find. Instead, they find  themselves in a stormy and often unfamiliar world that is difficult for them to  understand.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We owe older people a great debt of gratitude. They have paid their dues to our society and to this  Province. They deserve our special  attention. I support the proposal to appoint a special commissioner to  protect the rights and interests of elderly people.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I welcome the motion. Over the period  1996 to 2036, it is estimated that the percentage of the population here aged  65 or over will almost double from 13% to 24%. Some 41% of older people here  feel that they are treated differently from people in the general population  because of their age. Of those people, 76% feel that they are treated worse  than the general population because of their age. Research by the Human Rights  Commission in 2001 found that it is difficult to provide evidence that  discrimination on the grounds of age happens on a systematic basis, but that  fear exists among older people.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">According to the commission, the extent of discrimination tends to be hidden because of an  absence of research, especially in relation to the healthcare system. Practical consideration must be given to  planning for the future needs of a growing older population.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Older people are  increasingly marginalized or treated as less than equal citizens. They  are on the move through organisations such as Age Concern and Help the Aged.  Campaigns by these organisations and others have moved the issues affecting  older people from the periphery to the centre of the political debate. They  have recognised that negative attitudes to ageing across the island have prevented  the development of the policies and structures needed to address poverty, ill  health and isolation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Surely it is an indictment of Government policy that  approximately 200 older people die each year from cold-related illness.  Thousands more suffer from the indifference of a cold society.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Older people must be brought in from the cold, both  figuratively and literally. We must support and actively pursue the political  and legislative changes necessary to establish a decent standard of living,  full access to services and the rights of older people to participate fully in  the lives of their communities.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We must have a fundamental review of the standard of living  of older people, including pension provision and fuel poverty. Creating the  conditions for an equal society means recognising that many diverse groups need  enhanced protection. It should be recognised that older people have made a  lifetime contribution to society. Unfortunately, the standard of living of many  of our older people does not meet their needs or reflect the contribution that  they made.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is vital that mechanisms are developed to value properly  and recognise the contribution of older people to society. We must support  older people in realising their vital role in our communities, and we must stop  paying lip service to the rights of older people and appoint the commissioner  as a matter of urgency.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I join others in congratulating Mrs Bradley, the Member for Foyle, for ensuring  that the issue of appointing a commissioner for older people is kept high on  the Assembly&rsquo;s agenda.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members will be acutely aware of the need for action to  improve the way in which society treats older people. Many older people know  the benefit of good health and good support from their families; they have the  capacity to avail of local services and enjoy a fulfilled old age; and they  continue to make a major contribution to their community. Unfortunately, this  is not so for too many older people. We have all come across appalling examples  of crimes against the elderly and incidents  of neglect and abuse in our constituencies. Behind the high-profile  examples are tens of thousands of older people who are afflicted by poor  health, poverty and isolation.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We live in an ageing society. By 2013, almost a quarter of  the population will be of pensionable age. With this in mind, and the fact that  many of us will soon fall into the category of older people &mdash; I am not looking  at anyone in particular &mdash; surely now is the time for a new approach to older  people&rsquo;s issues.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We can already see what the new approach might look like.  Organisations such as Help the Aged and Age Concern have done much to draw our  attention to the good practice that exists across the whole range of issues of  importance to older people. There are many good inter-generational projects in  schools and communities, which help to inform young people about the  contribution of older people to society and which seek to counter the potential  for older people to become isolated.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are excellent examples of action to improve the health and well-being of older people by  encouraging them to continue to be physically active and providing  insulation to help them reduce fuel costs.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">While there are many examples of such good practice, there  are still major gaps in our approach to supporting older people, and we need a  new approach. The Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister &mdash;  and I am pleased to see both Ministers in the Chamber &mdash; has produced an older  people&rsquo;s strategy &lsquo;Ageing in an Inclusive Society&rsquo;.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee of the Centre, which has not yet been  renamed, and of which I have the honour to be Chairman, has not yet had the  opportunity to consider that strategy. I do not presume to know the views of my Committee colleagues on the issue. My  impressions of the strategy are that it articulates successfully many of  the issues that need to be addressed if we are to achieve a better quality of  life for older people and to ensure dignity and respect for the most vulnerable  older people.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The progress made to outlaw age discrimination in  employment since the launch of the strategy is particularly welcome. However,  the strategy noticeably stops short of recommending the establishment of a  commissioner for older people. My view, and that of the Ulster Unionist Party,  is that such a commissioner should be established as soon as possible. That  would enable the cause of older people in health and education to be  championed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We are in an age of lifelong learning, and there are recreational  interests, libraries and sporting facilities to be considered. Our counterparts  in the National Assembly for Wales  and the Scottish Parliament are already making progress. The key functions of a  commissioner would be to promote awareness and understanding of the rights and  interests of older people; to review the current policies and laws in so far as  they affect older people; and to help promote best practice in the services  being provided.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is no need to create a bureaucratic empire or a new  Department costing a fortune. The Office of the First Minister and the Deputy  First Minister is perfectly capable of managing the detail. The First Minister  is in a unique position to judge the value of such an appointment. I support  the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  &ldquo;If this Assembly is to be of any use to the people of Northern Ireland,  it must provide a fair deal to our senior citizens.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Where have we heard that sentence before? Our senior  citizens are proud and independent people. They have served their country well  and must be protected during their retirement.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">During the previous Northern Ireland Assembly, I had the pleasure of chairing a cross-party group  working on the concerns and problems of senior citizens. It was called  the age sector reference group, and it brought senior citizens from all corners  of Northern Ireland  to Parliament Buildings on a regular basis to discuss their needs and ways of  overcoming their problems.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I take the opportunity of thanking those dedicated people:  they are still campaigning, and it is obvious that they have not yet solved all  their problems. I hope that when the  Assembly is fully working and operational, a similar group will carry on  where they left off.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, the group is not happy about the dithering in the  Assembly last week &mdash; by the DUP in particular &mdash; on free personal care. It  annoys me enormously when I hear of senior citizens being denied millions of  pounds in benefits, to which they are entitled, through no fault of their own.  They go without just because the system is cumbersome, and they are put off by  having to fill in forms. A method must be devised, through social security,  where all senior citizens are made aware of their entitlements and, if  necessary, given help to receive all that is due to them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Like Members who spoke previously, I pay tribute to the  efforts of Age Concern, Help the Aged, Advice Northern Ireland, citizens advice bureaux throughout Northern Ireland  and groups of all sorts for assisting elderly  people. Society must never accept that an elderly person must choose between eating and heating.  The age sector reference group fought age discrimination and won. Our  slogan, &ldquo;Never on the scrap heap&rdquo; at 60 for women  and 65 for men is now, I am glad to say, history. I am glad to say that  people now have the choice of working for as long as they see fit.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Senior citizens have been the targets of robbers, muggers  and gangsters. Everyone has a duty to support the police in catching the  culprits, who ought to be dealt with severely.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are many ways in which to help senior citizens. When  we have a commissioner or overseer who is solely responsible for senior  citizens&rsquo; welfare, this country will be able to say that it looks after the  elderly well. Many issues that affect the elderly justify the appointment of a  full-time commissioner. Last year, the Transitional Assembly discussed  proposals to appoint a commissioner for older people. I hope that the DUP will  not treat this important subject as a political football again, in the same way  that it has treated free personal care for the elderly. In February 2001, in  the House, support for free personal care &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. Is it in order for a Member to  continually misrepresent others and to say  things that are not factual or truthful? I ask the Member to be more  explicit and detailed. It is all very well for him to say that the DUP has  hindered and obstructed this proposal, but it has done no such thing. My party  has been to the fore in challenging the issues that the Member is addressing,  and I ask him to recognise that.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I am afraid that that is all part of the cut and thrust of Assembly debate, Lord Morrow. Unless  the Member is actually telling a lie, there is nothing that the Chair can do  about it.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  If the cap fits, wear it &mdash; that is what I say.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I ask Members to recall February 2001, when everyone in the  Chamber supported free personal care. When Members had no power to implement  that provision, they supported it. In June 2002, however, when they had the  power, they reneged on that support. In June 2007, they are still dithering on  free personal care. Let us open that up to the public.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The debate has gone  beyond the need to create the post of commissioner for older people. We  must implement that without delay and have no more dithering. My colleague  mentioned the duplication of services. When the Alliance Party advocates the  appointment of a commissioner for older people, we mean just that: a  commissioner who will work alongside the already existing excellent voluntary  bodies.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I ask the Member to bring his remarks to a close.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I support the motion and look forward to its early implementation.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: I  support the motion. My party has long supported  the call for the appointment of a commissioner for older people. Indeed,  it was one of the pledges in our last manifesto. I therefore congratulate the  Member on tabling the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The DUP can be proud of its record on delivering for senior  citizens. In the previous Assembly, the DUP pioneered the warm homes scheme and  our Minister delivered free transport for the over-65s, enabling senior  citizens to travel around the country and get on with their everyday lives.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The population is ageing, and people are living longer than  ever before. It is therefore a huge challenge to provide healthcare and  benefits and to ensure that older people can continue to live full and active  lives. I am following with interest the new pop sensation The Zimmers, which  claims to be the oldest band in the world  and which seems to be heading for a high position in the UK charts with  its cover of The Who&rsquo;s classic &lsquo;My Generation&rsquo;. In its own unique way, it is  high&shy;lighting many of the issues that the older generation faces. The band  originated in a BBC &lsquo;Power to the People&rsquo; documentary by Tim Samuels, who  travelled around Britain  investigating the feelings of isolation and imprisonment that the elderly  suffer.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">For many older people, life can be a real struggle. Many  face poverty and hardship. No pensioner in Northern Ireland today should have  to choose between food, home heating and  the clothes on their back. Many older people are fearful of leaving  their homes. Almost daily, we hear of another attack on or robbery of a  pensioner. Those found guilty of such attacks should face the stiffest of  sentences for their sickening crimes.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Rising global fuel prices and the knock-on effect of that  on fuel costs in Northern    Ireland are also a real concern for the  elderly. Rises in the cost of home-heating oil, gas and petrol hit the most  vulnerable sections of our community the hardest.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The warm homes scheme is a key instrument for tackling fuel  poverty, and it is concerning that my constituency of East   Antrim is among the worst areas for take-up of that scheme.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Another, often hidden, problem in society is that of elder abuse. That abuse can take many forms and  happens when an elderly man or woman is intentionally or unintentionally  harmed, mistreated or neglected by someone whom he or she should be able to  trust. That abuse can be physical, financial, sexual, verbal or emotional, or  comprise acts of neglect. It is important that those who are abused can speak  up and seek help from a trusted friend,  relative or healthcare professional. We have already heard of the excellent  work carried out by Help the Aged, Age Concern, Action on Elder Abuse, social  services, hospitals and the police.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Health issues are of crucial importance. Dementia affects many relatives of people who are in the  Chamber. It is estimated that 11% of people aged over 65 will have  dementia by 2015, and it is imperative that we tackle that problem and ensure  that the needs of those who suffer from dementia are promoted. Creating more  residential and nursing home places, ensuring that elderly patients are afforded  the appropriate environment in which to receive care, and improving respite  provision are of paramount importance.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We should also recognise the enormous contribution of carers in our society. Some 6 million people  through&shy;out the UK,  including many in East Antrim and the rest of  Northern Ireland,  provide unpaid help and support to relatives, friends or partners who  could not otherwise manage because of frailties, illness or disability. Many of  those carers are unknown to statutory agencies and other organisations that  could provide support and services. It is important that the work of carers is  recognised, and support is given to them to live a full life themselves, by  providing them with the help that they need.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that older people are able to continue to be active participants in society without being  excluded in any way. That is why we  on the DUP Benches believe that a  commissioner for the elderly can act as a champion for the cause of  older people and ensure that issues affecting them are kept high on the list of  priorities for the Executive. There are so many areas on which a commissioner  could represent the interests of our elderly population. I support the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Once again, Members are debating a motion concerning people  in our society who suffer from wide-ranging forms of discrimination due to  their age. How many times have we said that, if we had the power, we would work  to ensure a strong voice for older people? How many debates or discussions have  we had during which we told one another, or those representing the older  generation, that, if only we had the power, the situation would be different?  That time is now, folks.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I commend the Members who proposed the motion. Unlike last  week&rsquo;s motion on free personal care, which Sinn F&eacute;in supported, the proposed  measures would not cost &pound;20 million or &pound;30 million to implement. All Members  should put our hands in the air in support of the rights of older people, and,  by our actions, set ourselves on a course to begin that process. We have an  opportunity to take that step today, and to send out a message that every party  in the House stands for better protection for those to whom we owe our very  existence: those who nurtured us and took care of our ills; who provided for us  in our growing years; those whom we love, but also, if we are honest, those  whom we have ignored or are less tolerant with, because they do not respond as  quickly as we would expect; and those who are overlooked when they seek a job.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">How many times have we witnessed older people being ignored  or abused by those who should have known better, and said nothing? How many  times have we, in our own communities, spent time with older people who,  unfortunately, fell prey to the beaters and intimidators who robbed, wrecked  and abused them, and who, because of their age, were unable to defend  themselves?<em> [Interruption.]</em></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Obviously, someone from the DUP finds this funny.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">How many times have we responded to attacks on older people,  only for the matter to be moved off our radars until the next attack happens?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Older people are not  asking for something outrageous or that is beyond our power. They are  not asking for something that we would not demand for ourselves. They are  asking for equality and they are seeking respect. They are asking us to show  leadership and to initiate a series of measures that can proactively tackle the  many problems that face older people. Let us agree that that cause would be  better served by establishing a commissioner for older people, and let us look  towards stronger legislation to tackle the many inequalities faced by older  people.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Let us also examine the establishment of an all-party  working group, the terms of which would be time bound, to produce recommendations  for dealing with those problems. Let us examine the various organisations that  are under our jurisdiction to see whether they can stand the test of age  proofing.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We should all remember that, in a few short years, we will  reap the benefits of what we sow in the House today. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.00 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>: Once again, I remind Members that the use  of mobile phones in the Chamber is prohibited. I suggest that the standard of  debate this afternoon does not require Members to set their mobile phones for  an alarm call.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCausland</strong>:  The welfare and well-being of older people is an important issue for any  civilised and compassionate society. I am pleased, therefore, that the motion  has been tabled; it is a good motion, and it has been a good debate. I believe  that the motion will have all-party support. Therefore, it was disappointing  that Mr McCarthy sought to introduce such a sour and divisive note into the  discussion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  He should apologise to Mr McCausland.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCausland</strong>:  I can assure Mr Kennedy that I am not that sensitive. However, I do have an  interest in people being accurate and truthful.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I refer to the example of the Commissioner for Children and  Young People. That appointment has amply demonstrated the value that a commissioner  can have in addressing the particular needs, concerns and rights of people in a  sector of our society. That has been a very successful commission and office.  The same benefits should be accrued by older folk who would benefit from a  commissioner for older people.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Having seen the benefits to younger people of such an  appointment for younger people, and drawing the conclusion that a commissioner  would be of equal benefit to older citizens, we must see this as an equality  issue. We live in a society in which there is much talk about equality and the  equality agenda. The rights of older people to fair and equal treatment are  already embedded in that equality agenda. It is also a human rights issue, and  the proposer mentioned the UN principles for older people.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We must recognise the tremendous work that is done across Northern Ireland  in each of our constituencies by local, province-wide and UK-national  organisations that represent the interests of senior citizens. In my  constituency, the north Belfast  senior citizens&rsquo; forum does tremendous work: it provides a network for senior  citizens and gives them opportunities and access that many of them would not  otherwise have. I am pleased to say that there is also now a west Belfast senior citizens&rsquo;  forum.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Not long ago, over a period of months, and with the support  of Belfast City Council&rsquo;s good relations fund, the link centre in North Belfast sponsored a major consultation with senior  citizens groups across the constituency and that culminated in a impressive event  in the Great Hall in the City Hall. The views of the people who were consulted  and the views of politicians were brought together and a report was presented.  It was impressive to see the wide range of senior citizens&rsquo; groups that were  represented that day and how articulate and forthright many of them were in  presenting their views.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Research by such groups, as well as by Age Concern, Help  the Aged and those who represent the interests of carers, has helped to  identify many issues that must be addressed. Some of the issues are: social  care, health care, transport, income, opportunities for education and  employment, and the pertinent issue of the safety and security of senior  citizens, not only in their homes, but in the streets.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Many older people have much to contribute to society,  through the family network and in other ways. As we seek to enhance their  rights and increase their opportunities, we benefit not only the senior  citizens, but society as a whole. In that process, there is a valuable and  important role for a commissioner for older people. I, therefore, support the  motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Robert Coulter</strong>: I congratulate Mrs Bradley, a Member from  the Foyle constituency, for bringing this motion to the House. However, I must  say that the motion has raised some problems for me. For example, do I need to  declare an interest?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Robert  Coulter</strong>: On the other hand, should the First Minister or I decide to apply  for the post, does our presence today bar us  from making that application? Perhaps a man of your perspicacity could  give us your wisdom on that, Mr Deputy Speaker.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  Definitely, yes. <em>[Laughter.]</em></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  That is a challenge.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Robert  Coulter</strong>: In considering the motion, I tried to quantify the impact of the  issue. Some of the figures that my research yielded are slightly different to  those that have already been given. The figures that I found show that Northern Ireland  has 275,000 people of pensionable age, which is 16% of the total population.  That figure is set to rise to 24% of the population by 2013, only six years  from now. In assimilating that figure, the conclusion is that one in four or a  quarter of the population is aged over 60. That would suggest that we need a  specially appointed commissioner to look after their interests.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The office of the Northern Ireland Commissioner for  Children and Young People was created to look after the interests of children.  In fact, a former Member of this House, Patricia Lewsley, now fills that  position &mdash; very ably, I might add. The 2001 census told us that, at that time,  there were 298,054 children in Northern    Ireland under the age of 16. That is 17&middot;68%  of the total population. That figure is remarkably close to the 275,000 people  of pensionable age, and it is lower than the 2013 figure for people of  pensionable age. I would contend, therefore, that if Northern Ireland has a Children&rsquo;s  Commissioner for 17&middot;68% of the population, it could surely have an older  people&rsquo;s commissioner for 16% of the population.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Setting aside the numeric argument, which is incontestable,  are there any special circumstances pertaining  to older people that merit the special protection that a commissioner  for older people might afford them? My conclusion is that there most certainly  are.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Nearly one in three people of pensionable age lives alone, and half of all people of pensionable age  identify loneliness as a major problem. One in every five of older  people in Northern Ireland  lives in poverty, and half of fuel-poor householders here are aged over 60.  However, the number of older persons in receipt of home help has decreased by  11% from 1998.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is believed that, at  any one time, 5% of older people are  at risk of abuse, and one quarter of those who abuse them are their sons  and daughters.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Two thirds of people over the age of 65 think that older  workers are discriminated against in job recruitment, a feeling, I might add,  that in many cases is born from bitter experience.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Ageism, in all its forms, is deeply contemptible. Therefore, the House should support the motion.  Often, ageism is nothing more than the naked ambition and self-interest  of younger people who want to sweep older people away as if they are of no  account and have nothing to offer. To them, youth is nothing more than a mantra  to paper over their own self-interest. They are so self-centred and  narrow-minded that they disregard the wealth of experience that older people  can offer.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is much more that I could say, but I am reminded,  especially, of a young doctor of my acquaintance who was working in one of the  most exclusive and affluent areas of one of our great cities. She called to see  an old lady, who had &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I ask you to draw your remarks to a close.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Robert  Coulter</strong>: I support the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  That was quite an interesting story. <em>[Laughter.]</em></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>A Member</strong>:  What happened next?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Robert  Coulter</strong>: I will tell you again. <em>[Laughter.]</em></p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Members will have to find out the end of the story at another  time.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>: I  welcome the motion, but I too regret that the first mandate of the Assembly,  before its suspension, did not proceed with  the issue. At that time, the need for such an appointment was  recognised, and it would have gone ahead after the appointment of the  Commissioner for Children and Young People, but, sadly, that did not happen.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Much time has been wasted, and many older people have had  to survive &mdash; or die &mdash; without the protection of such an advocate. It was  mentioned earlier that it has been left to the voluntary sector &mdash; Age Concern,  Help the Aged, St Vincent de Paul, the Salvation Army, and so on &mdash; to help out.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is clear, from consideration of the Welsh model, that  the major issues have been set out. There is clearly an opportunity to use that  model, update it and change it as the priorities change with life.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Why should there be a  commissioner for older people? Hardly  a day passes that we do not hear of issues relating to older people that are embarrassing and even  shameful. That should not happen in a modern democracy that has put so  much emphasis on equality issues.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Being equally poor and  equally discriminated against is not, of course, a reason for doing  nothing. Neither is it good enough to make an appointment and leave the future  to the new appointee. Attitudes across society must change &mdash; in families, in  neighbourhoods, across the range of public services and especially in health  provision, in education, in jobs, in housing, and so on.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">What are the benefits of having a commissioner for older  people? They are endless. The prospects of a long and healthy life for older  people are much greater if those people are cherished as important individuals  in society, encouraged to remain active and made to feel that they still  contribute to society in a positive way. That would mean that fewer older  people would be forced into costly residential care at an early age, more of  them would remain free from strokes and heart disease, and we would have a  better society.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A healthier society appreciates its older people, does not  experience high levels of brutal attacks on elderly people, forms positive  relationships with them, checks on their well-being and learns from their  lifetime experiences. That already happens in many regions, especially in rural  areas. However, it is hit or miss and is not universal.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The appointment of a commissioner is vital in order to  rebuild good practices that were widespread in the past but have somehow been  forgotten in this modern rat race that has focused on the material aspects of  life while overlooking the most cherished gift that we have &mdash; our older people.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the past, Governments have not been good to older  people. They forced them to live on derisory pensions, gave them poor housing  and overlooked issues such as hypothermia, isolation, fear of dying in poverty  and, for many years, begrudged them free travel. There are many other issues.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In recent times, the issue of free transport has been  addressed, and warm homes schemes have been introduced. Although there has been  some recognition of other issues, they are still far from being resolved. Sales  of emergency drums of heating oil are on the increase, and there is no need for  me to tell Members who the main customers are.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As the second mandate of the Assembly finds its feet and  begins to pick up the pieces of a neglected past, everyone should identify with  those who were forced to live through the Troubles, complained little and are  now at a stage in their lives when they could benefit from a commissioner. Let  us begin. I support the motion and I congratulate my colleague Mary Bradley, who has championed this cause for many  years.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Robinson</strong>:  I commend Mrs Bradley for proposing the motion. As the issue has been debated  on the Floor of the House before, I hope that the support that Members  previously expressed will be evident again today.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Many older people are extremely able to speak for  themselves &mdash; we all have constituents who raise the profile of issues that  affect older people and who campaign on their behalf &mdash; but that is not the  whole picture. There is no doubt that older people are among the most vulnerable in our society. They are more  likely to live on low incomes and about half of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  elderly live on less than &pound;10,000 per year. As a result, many older people live  in fuel poverty, as was highlighted in the House recently. Older people are  also more likely to suffer from a long-standing illness and be entitled to  benefits but, unfortunately, many do not take up the benefits to which they are  entitled.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Those facts outline  some of the reasons why we need a commissioner for older people in Northern Ireland, but we can also draw on our  experience of having the Northern    Ireland Commissioner for Children and Young  People. We should also look to Scotland  and Wales,  where people have already taken the initiative. A commissioner for older people  could increase awareness of the interests of older people, promote  opportunities and reduce levels of discrimination against older people. The  role could help us all to value the contribution that older people have given  to society and &mdash; far more importantly &mdash; highlight the role that they still  play.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">A key role for any  commissioner should be to monitor the work of the Assembly and to review  how it affects older people. A commissioner would also provide the ability to  fight individual cases and act as an advocate on people&rsquo;s behalf. Such a role  would provide direct empowerment to older people, who have hitherto been able  to turn to their elected representatives but have not had a direct voice. I  hope that Members will support the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The DUP is rightly proud of its record in this area. From  delivering free transport for older people to pioneering the warm homes scheme,  we can point to many achievements. However, the job does not stop there. I  fully support the call that has been made, both today and previously, to  introduce a commissioner who can provide a voice for older people throughout Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, I commend the work that Help the Aged, Age  Concern and other agencies have done to make life a little more comfortable for  our elderly citizens. I support the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I will start by thanking a number of people. In particular, I thank Mr McCarthy  for introducing some vitality into the debate &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  Not vitality but truth.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  It is good to see that he is still paying attention.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I also thank the Rev Dr Robert Coulter for his comments. I  can tell him that ageism is an issue that the Ulster Unionist Party takes very  seriously. It is fair to say that we have checked for ageism and we have not  found any sign of it as yet, but we will keep the matter under review, as it is  a serious issue.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">One issue that has come across is that the proportion of  people who are elderly will rise from 16% to 24%. Those numbers are quite  startling, as they mean that one person in  four will be of pensionable age. However, the fact is that we are all  living longer. As we heard from the Minister of Health, Social Services and  Public Safety earlier, the very significant advances that we have made in  enabling people to live longer is one of the real successes of our society. Of  course, in those additional years people need some help when concerns arise  with health or with other issues. We need to understand the unprecedented  challenges that such people face and how we might go some way towards  alleviating them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In February, during the run-up to the recent election, when  we were all going round knocking on doors, like plenty of other people I was  struck by the number of people who, after 6.00 pm when it became dark, would  not open their door&mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  When they saw who it was.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I am pleased to see that Kieran McCarthy is still alive.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I was also struck, when delivering leaflets, by the number  of houses that had a letterbox to the side.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Why? Kids put  firecrackers through their letterboxes. It is disgraceful that elderly  people keep money in kitchen drawers so that they have ready cash to hand over  to burglars if their homes are broken into. That is awful: in what kind of  society are we living?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Fear is not the only  problem. Eighty thousand people live  on their own, and loneliness is an issue. The distance that elderly  people live from public transport is also an issue. Members mentioned abuse,  which manifests itself in many forms: it might be an elderly person doing too  much babysitting, or it might be a 65-year-old person looking after an  85-year-old relative.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Rev Dr Robert Coulter did not get a chance to finish  the story that a doctor had told him. He wanted to tell Members the story, so I  will finish it now. The doctor told him about an old lady who had had a  distinguished career. She had been wealthy but had been left on her own,  suffering from dementia. Her daughter had robbed and abandoned her, leaving her  without a penny. The daughter had obtained power of attorney, cleared out her  mother&rsquo;s bank accounts and put the house in which her mother was still living  up for sale. That sort of thing goes on.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Twenty-two per cent of old people live in poverty. However,  one statistic confuses me: 49% of old people live on an annual income of less  than &pound;10,000, which means that almost one half of the elderly population lives  on less than &pound;10,000 a year, but those people are not considered to be living in poverty. That is outrageous.  Inflation for elderly people is almost 50% higher than the headline inflation  rate. Many people think that young people  are most likely to get into debt. However, it is actually elderly people  who get into debt.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is much that we can do. We need one independent person to look after elderly people  because the many issues concerning them cut across several areas. Such a  person could champion the rights of elderly people and could ensure that all  Departments, not only internal champions, looked after them. All Members, including  Kieran McCarthy, should support the motion unanimously.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy First  Minister (Mr M McGuinness)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I  am pleased to address the Assembly on the matter of older people, and in particular on how best to deal  effectively, champion and promote issues that impact directly on them. I  thank Mary Bradley for tabling this important motion.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Office of the First Minister and the Deputy Minister appointed junior Ministers whose  responsibility is to co-ordinate policy for older people, across  Government and in the Executive, thereby ensuring that older people&rsquo;s needs are  championed at every level of the decision-making process.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mary Bradley referred to the demographic ageing of society.  That represents one of the major challenges of the twenty-first century, as  fertility levels have fallen and longevity has increased, with older people  living longer and healthier lives. Technology has altered employment patterns &mdash;  combined with changes in age structure and health, the experience and meaning  of old age has been transformed.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As Mary Bradley said, statistics show that the population  is getting older: between 2001 and 2041, it is anticipated that the number of  people here will increase from 1&middot;689 million to 1&middot;723 million. Over the same  period, the number of people of pensionable age will increase from about  259,000 to 495,000, which means that, over  the next 40 years, the number of people in this group will almost  double. By 2030, one quarter of the population of the developed world will be  over 65 years of age, and almost one half of the population of western Europe  will be over 50 years of age.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Such a demographic  change brings not only challenges but  rich opportunities to harness the experience, expertise and creativity of  older people.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The fact that people are living longer and healthier lives  is a cause for celebration, not least because it reflects the success of our  health and care services. However, despite that, it is of serious concern that  too many older people suffer financial  hardship, or live lonely and isolated lives, often in fear of their  personal safety.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The debate has produced a clear consensus that urgent  action is needed to improve the lives of those older people who are most at  risk and most vulnerable. Mary Bradley  highlighted elder abuse and discrimination. In her view, current  Government policies are not sufficient. Alex Easton mentioned the work of  various commissions and their contribution to the political process. Mickey  Brady talked about marginalisation and the need to literally bring older people  in from the cold. He also mentioned the contributions that older people have  made to our society during their lifetimes.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Danny Kennedy rightly addressed crime against the elderly.  He mentioned that some Members might fall into that category. He looked at me  when he made that comment; I should remind him that he is not too far behind  me. However, he also paid a compliment to the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister by  saying that he thinks that we are well capable of dealing with the issues  raised today.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Kieran McCarthy thanked people who campaign on behalf of  the elderly, and I am pleased to see that some of them are visiting the  Building today. He spoke about the need for  everyone to support old people, particularly those old people who are  abused in their own homes and who are subjected to criminal activities. He also  drew attention to the importance of apprehending those responsible and  supporting the police. I wholeheartedly endorse that sentiment.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Alistair Ross talked about The Zimmers &mdash; I am glad that he  was not looking at me at the time. Several Members highlighted the contribution  of the First Minister to the Assembly. Given the work that has been achieved  over the last number of weeks, that is deserved praise.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The contribution that carers make to old people is crucial.  Alastair Ross touched on that when he talked about the exclusion of older  people. Fra McCann mentioned the need for a strong voice for older people and  the need for all of us to support their rights. Nelson McCausland spoke of the  value and success of the Commissioner for Children and Young People. He said that the motion is a matter of equality and human  rights. He also talked about the importance of consultation with groups  who are involved with older people.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Rev Dr Coulter asked whether he should declare an interest in the debate &mdash; every Member of the  Assembly needs to declare an interest on this issue. John Dallat talked  about attitudes across society and the need for those attitudes to change. He  also mentioned the importance of neighbours and keeping in contact with older  people. George Robinson and Basil McCrea also made important contributions to  the debate.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I recently visited a house not far from my home where three  people in their mid-70s, two brothers and a sister, had their house broken  into, were abused in their own home, and had a considerable sum of money stolen  from them. I acknowledge the positive work of Help the Aged, Age Concern, the  Society of St Vincent de Paul and others  who work on behalf of older people. Many Members also praised the work  of those vital organisations.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The needs of older people are all too apparent.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  Does the Minister also condemn an attack that took place yesterday on an  elderly resident of Ballywalter, who was robbed in broad daylight in the middle  of the street? That is an example of the society that we are living in.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy First  Minister</strong>: I wholeheartedly condemn it, and I urge anyone with any  information about that incident, or any other incident where older people are  abused, to pass it on to the police.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are too many reports of disgraceful attacks on older  people and burglaries in their homes, where they have a right to be safe and  secure. That is apparent through the extensive body of research, which shows not only the difficulties that older people face  in accessing services such as transport, but also the loneliness and  lack of support they experience, particularly those in single pensioner households.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The research also shows that needs become particularly acute for those who are over 75  years of age, and those concerns are reflected in what older people have to say. There were 14 workshops held here  recently as part of the development of the action plan on social inclusion. The Get Heard project made it clear that  older people wanted to see an end to age discrimination, and increased  availability of better jobs for older workers, including more support for  part-time workers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am happy to say that some of those concerns have begun to  be addressed. For example, last October new legislation was introduced to  prohibit unjustified age discrimination in the workplace, which created  important new rights and responsibilities for all employees and businesses  here.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">People are living longer, healthier lives, and it is  essential that the talents of older workers do not go to waste. They must have  the opportunity to continue working if they want to do so. Age regulations will  accelerate a culture change in the workplace and will impact on every aspect of  the employment relationship from recruitment to retirement.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Age regulations also  represent a very positive addition to the current body of  anti-discrimination law and will make a practical difference to many people.  However, legislation alone is not enough.  Progressive policies are also  required that will identify the barriers and problems faced by old  people in their daily lives and remove those barriers while keeping to, and  being guided by, the United Nations Principles for Older Persons.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The previous devolved Administration established an  interdepartmental and inter-sectoral working group to develop a strategy and an  action plan to improve the lives of older people. That work was completed  during suspension, and it falls to the Assembly to ensure that the strategy and  action plan are fit for purpose as a matter of priority.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The first action plan to deliver the objectives of the  current older people&rsquo;s strategy and progress report has been published. It covers many important areas of public service  including housing, transport and community safety.  Specific examples of the positive actions include the all-island free  travel scheme for older people; a benefit uptake programme aimed at ensuring  that older people receive all the benefits  to which they are entitled; and a fuel poverty strategy, which aims to  eradicate fuel poverty in all vulnerable households by 2010.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Later this year, the Executive will consider and agree on a future action plan for older people. It is  evident that there is much support in  the Chamber for establishing an independent office of commissioner for  older people. Such an office exists in Wales  but not in Ireland, England or Scotland, and we therefore intend  to examine the previous Administration&rsquo;s Ageing in an Inclusive Society  strategy, with a view to ensuring that the commitments therein reflect the  views and priorities of the new Executive.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The case for a commissioner for older people will be  discussed with Ministerial colleagues and the Executive, and proposals will be  brought forward. Our proposals will look at how best to champion the needs of  older people and the costs and benefits of different options. Ultimately, our  proposals must be those that are most likely to deliver the positive outcomes  that our older people deserve.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy First  Minister</strong>: I have just finished, but I will give way and I will answer.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I seek the Minister&rsquo;s assurance that the Committee of the First Minister and  Deputy First Minister will have full access to any new proposals and any  consultation exercise.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy First  Minister</strong>: We are fully committed to working closely and in harmony with the  Member&rsquo;s Committee.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  I thank all who took part in this worthwhile debate. I will attempt to touch on  what everyone said without delaying proceedings, as I am conscious that there  is more work to do.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Alex Easton took part in the debate and talked about the  illnesses that older people have to contend with and how they often feel left  out. Mickey Brady mentioned the contribution that older people make to society  and said he would like them brought in from the cold. Danny Kennedy talked  about neglect, abuse and ill health and how it was time for a new approach.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Kieran McCarthy said we should have a fair deal for older people, including cold-weather payments.  Alastair Ross talked of crime against the elderly, fuel costs and health  issues such as dementia. Fra McCann talked  of attacks on older people and the motion on free personal care for the  elderly that my colleague Carmel Hanna moved in the Assembly last week.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Fra McCann also said that older people feel undervalued. It  is important that we carry through what we do agree for our older people today  and do not just talk about it.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Nelson McCausland mentioned the value that a commissioner  could have and how that is an equality issue &mdash; perhaps even a human rights one.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Rev Robert Coulter said  that we need a commissioner and gave us some percentages. He pointed out  the value of the Children&rsquo;s Commissioner and how the same could happen for our  older people. He did start to tell us what sounded like a very good story, but  unfortunately he did not get to finish it &mdash; so, perhaps some other time, Dr  Coulter.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">John Dallat said that older people could either survive or  die and said that the Welsh model might be useful to us. He said that we should  all be ashamed of the attacks that take place on older people, and he too  supported a commissioner.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">George Robinson also supported a commissioner. He said that  there are many older people who cannot speak for themselves and that a  commissioner would help them greatly.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Basil McCrea talked  about the elderly being afraid to open their doors. We all know that is true  from our own areas, where they have five and six bolts on their doors.  God bless them &mdash; I do not think that people could get in to them if there was a  fire. I hope I have left no one out.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister himself spoke then, and I welcome his saying  that he will look at the situation and at the need for a commissioner. After  all the years in which this has been talked about, the facts and figures show  why we should have a commissioner for the elderly. I urge the Minister to do  this sooner rather than later.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank Members for their contributions. I hope we can all  look forward to the day when the elderly get their commissioner and feel valued  and safe in their homes. We will all have played a part in that.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That this Assembly calls upon the Office of the First  and Deputy First Minister to prioritise, as a matter of urgency, the  appointment of a Commissioner for Older People, as previously supported by the  Transitional Assembly.</p>
	      <p class="H4StageHeading">Post Offices</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I beg to move </p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly notes the grave threat to rural  communities with the closure of up to two hundred Post Offices in Northern  Ireland, and calls upon the Office of First Minister and Deputy First Minister  to use their office to support the retention of Post Offices by advocating the  use of Post Office services for governmental and council business as far as is  practicable.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Hit wusnae sae lang sine at we met in this chammer an&rsquo;  taaked aboot the ill daeins agin oor Poastal Service an hoo needfu&rsquo; hit wus tae  houl oantae es monie poast offaices es cud bae kep&rsquo;.

Instead  o&rsquo; a &ldquo;Pretend &lsquo;Semmelie&rdquo; es yin member cried hit in the las&rsquo; debate aboot this  issue in Janwerry aa the tim&rsquo; o&rsquo; the Transitional &lsquo;Semmelie, we ir noo a  devolved &lsquo;Semmelie at bes fit tae maak a differ an&rsquo; pley a baag pairt no onie  tae houl oantae oor Poast Offaices bit tae mak&rsquo; thaim betther.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It was not so long ago that Members met in the Chamber and  discussed the attack on our postal service and the necessity of retaining as  many post offices as possible. The situation today is the same, if not worse,  but there is a major difference. This is not a &ldquo;pretend Assembly&rdquo;, as one  Member called the Transitional Assembly during the debate on post office  closures in January; this is a devolved Assembly that can make a difference and  play a major part in the retention of our post offices and their enhancement.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The bare essentials  remain as they were: it is planned that up to 200 post offices will be  shut. That is the crux of the matter, and problems arising from that are  especially evident in rural communities, which continually and consistently bear the brunt of the Labour Government&rsquo;s machinations. The closure of rural  schools because they are supposed to  be not viable; draft planning policy statement 14 (PPS 14) will prevent  growth and the retention of family units; higher petrol prices make the now  necessary daily journeys into town for necessities more expensive; and little  support is given to the agriculture sector. Ultimately, the Labour Government  has attacked the culture and diversity of country life. Furthermore, the  closure of the local post office often leads to the closure of a local shop  that often doubles up as a post office and which cannot survive alone; or of a  shop next door to the post office that has lost business because customers will  now use the shops beside the post office in the bigger towns. The new  arrangements will be great for town businesses &mdash; most of which are thriving &mdash;  but not so great for village life, which centres round the small businesses  that are the core of the village.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It has been estimated that 82% of small businesses will be  adversely affected by the post office closures, and 15% of them attribute the  success of their business to the presence of  the post office. The knock-on effect of the post office closures will be  the closure of a further 50% of rural businesses. Make no mistake: the closure  of post offices is part of the incessant attacks on rural life by those who do  not understand or will not try to understand  how anything outside the city looks or works.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My constituents who live around the Ards Peninsula or in  Lisbane, Killinchy and Ballygowan consider the post office to be an invaluable  part of the village, and for many it is a connection to services that they  would otherwise have no access to. Some elderly people are holding on to their  independence for as long as possible before succumbing to the institutionalised  nursing or residential homes that have previously been debated in the Chamber,  but the removal of the post office from their locality is making that even more  difficult. They will no longer have the superb network of local post offices  where the staff know and remember their customers&rsquo; names, where they will  notice if wee Mrs Jones has not collected her pension and check that she is OK.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The already busy staff in the main post offices do not have  the time to register who or who has not been in. That, along with the added  costs of travelling by bus or having to make unnecessary car journeys, will not  only adversely affect the financial part of pensioners&rsquo; lives &mdash; which is  already a delicate balance in many cases &mdash; but will add to their vulnerability.  They face an arduous bus journey, feel less safe in a town where no one knows  them, and, understandably, they will feel more alone and vulnerable in the sea  of bodies that they meet.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Jack McCullough of the National Pensioners&rsquo; Association has  spoken of the detrimental effect that post office closures will have on the  confidence of the community&rsquo;s elderly sector. Age Concern has said that more  than 95% of elderly people consider the post office to be their lifeline into  the community &mdash; and as the previous debate was about the elderly, that is  particularly pertinent. If it becomes the case that their nearest post office  is 10 miles away &mdash; or further &mdash; that lifeline is stretched to the limit.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is not only elderly people who will be affected by the  post office closures, so will the disabled and restricted. The closures will  mean that those people will have to travel in special kneeling buses or costly  private taxis to collect their benefits, or they will have to, unwillingly,  give up more of their independence and assign power of attorney to someone else  to collect their pensions when they have always been able to do so themselves.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Royal National Institute for the Blind (RNIB) said that  the post office closures will affect the blind and partially sighted  particularly hard, and that it will leave  them even more financially and socially excluded. The closures will also  effect those whose ability to get into the  main towns is restricted by our often unreliable and, sometimes, restrictive public transport system, which is not  helped by the poor state of our country roads.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members could carry on if their wages were late, but that  is not the case for most of the elderly or the disabled people who live from  pension day to pension day and from benefit day to benefit day.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Donaldson</strong>: Will the Member join me in com&shy;mending the National Federation  of SubPostmasters (NFSP) &mdash; in particular, its Northern Ireland branch &mdash; on its  excellent work to promote the benefits of post offices? The NFSP campaigns not only for the retention of its  service and businesses but for the retention of a service that is an inherent  part of the whole community &mdash; especially for the elderly, as the Member has  said.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>: I thank the Member for his intervention, and I agree with everything that he has said. The  people whom we represent tell us the same story.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">For an elderly person, a two-day delay in collecting a  pension can lead to a choice between heating the house and buying food, or even  living that wee bit longer. Isolation is also a problem for young mothers with  small children. Access to the village shop and other amenities is important, as  it provides them with a chance to pop into the village to collect their child  benefit, or simply to interact with adults instead of children. Those issues must  be grasped.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">People who want to pop in to lift an extra tenner to put on  their electricity card now must pay an extra &pound;1&middot;25 for doing so, because cash  machines that charge users are becoming more common in our villages. That cost must be levied, but, nonetheless, it is an  extra cost. Only 4% of villages have a bank, whereas 60% have a post  office. A large number of closures will mean that reliance on those types of  cash machines will be greater, and those who cannot afford to shoulder a  greater financial burden will acutely feel the financial ramifications.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">More than 4&middot;3 million people have a Post Office card  account (POCA), but that will no longer be so handy for lifting money.  Subsequently, use of that account will become more limited, and thereby less  attractive, so the Post Office will lose more business. From an environmental  perspective, added journeys to another post office can never be a good thing.  All those extra pressures will prove too much for many people.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My colleague Mr Donaldson has mentioned the National  Federation of SubPostmasters&rsquo; campaign. The Federation of Small Businesses  (FSB) has stated that 86% of small firms send their mail through the Post  Office. That includes 69% of their invoices. Those firms will now have to  factor in the financial cost of the journey to a main post office and the cost  to their business in lost working hours.  Those are clear problems.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">First and foremost, we  must be adamant in our refusal to phase out the use of POCAs for current  Government transactions. Furthermore, the Post Office should once again have  responsibility for social security payments, using modern chip-and-pin methods.  That would enhance the Post Office service, while making the system more  efficient &mdash; the current banking system is riddled with problems and  inaccuracies.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Encouraging large numbers of people to use post offices  again would show the modern and efficient systems available in the local post  office to greater advantage. It would also encourage new business, as customers  could avail themselves of services of which they were not previously aware. It  is important that customers realise that they can tax their car at the post  office. Members should cast their minds back to a few years ago, when  tax-renewal forms had to be sent to Coleraine.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I thought of another suggestion when in the Ards Borough  Council building the other day. The secretary and the receptionist were both  very busy. One was answering the phone, the other was dealing with dog  licences, and, all the while, a queue of people was building up behind them. It  struck me that some of that work could be shifted to local post offices. Why  not let the post offices deal with dog  licences? How much longer will those  queues be when super-councils are introduced under the review of public  administration (RPA)?</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Members will undoubtedly highlight other ways in which the  Office of First Minister and the Deputy First Minister  can help the post offices and how it has within its grasp the ability to  change the future of post offices in Northern Ireland. The crux of the  matter is that the imminent closure of some  200 post offices will adversely affect many in our Province. OFMDFM and  the rest of the Assembly must step up to the mark and back a service that has  the potential to flourish and to benefit all in the Province, should it be  given the opportunity to do so. I urge Members to support the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  I beg to move the following amendment: After &ldquo;rural&rdquo; insert &ldquo;and urban&rdquo;; and  leave out all after the second &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; and insert</p>

	      <p class="B3BodyText">The purpose of my amendment is to ensure the inclusion of  urban post offices in the motion and to ensure that the Office of the First  Minister and the Deputy First Minister consider the formulation of an effective  strategy to maximise the use of Post Office services by Government Departments.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">When I last spoke in the House about the threat faced by  post offices, I highlighted the need to retain Post Office card accounts to help ensure their continued  viability. I welcome the news that the Government are to proceed with the  successor to the card account and to extend the social network payment until  2010. However, it is essential that the successor to the card account remains a  Post Office product with a full migration of current account holders over to  the new version. The new card must be complemented by a comprehensive Post Office banking offer with full access to all  major High Street banks at Post Office counters.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Unfortunately, the Government have not seen fit to extend  their own use of the sub-post office network to deliver key services. Even Post  Office Ltd itself has not chosen to deliver a full range of banking services  and other products to the network.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  Members should know that the Minister for Social Development has sought advice  on retaining and extending the Post Office card account so that it can be used  for the delivery of benefits in the future. Furthermore, the use of the card  account as a delivery mechanism does not interfere with the parity rule  endorsed by this House. Benefits can therefore be obtained at full value even  though the system of delivery is separate from that used in Great Britain.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>: I thank Mr Maginness for his inter&shy;vention. I recognise the  commitment of the Minister for Social Development to facilitating  benefit payments through the Post Office network in Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The news of the closure of 2,500 post offices in the UK as a whole, with 200 of them in Northern Ireland,  is a huge blow to the network, even though  compensation will be made available to the people affected by those closures.  Nevertheless, local communities will be left to pick up the pieces.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Earlier today the Assembly debated the rights of older  people. A report published by Age Concern on the post office closures stated  that 99% of older people in rural areas consider the local post office to be a  lifeline. Many older rural dwellers feel isolated; the report showed that 56%  of people over 60 living in the countryside  fear that post office closures will leave them feeling even more  isolated. Seventy three per cent of those older people surveyed believed that  if Post Office services in their area were to be discontinued, they would be  unable to access any similar services that might be provided.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">These are hard facts; once again, they underline the value of our local post offices. The closure of  post offices will create problems for disadvantaged residents who need  cash for basic groceries &mdash; money that they previously had access to in the post  office. Elderly and disabled people and anyone with restricted mobility, such as mothers with young children, will face  problems travelling to branches that are further away, especially those  who have to depend on public transport, which can be unreliable in rural areas.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The closure of a local post office can cause the loss of  independence and community spirit for residents with damaging repercussions for  local shops and businesses. As I mentioned earlier, the amendment includes  urban post offices because it is not only rural post offices that are  threatened. The New Economics Foundation&rsquo;s report, &lsquo;The Last Post&rsquo;, states that  there are significant knock-on effects for businesses, community groups and  local people when an urban post office closes. One out of six urban post office  closures took place in deprived areas where their role is particularly valuable  and where a large number of people depend on them to access pensions and  benefits through the Post Office card account.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Westminster Government must review their proposals.  What is needed is not further closures but adequate investment in a suite of  banking services, improved business services, payment for the social and  economic service that is provided by non-commercial offices, as well as  investment grants for refurbishment and modernisation of offices.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The motion, as amended, demands more than just action from  the Westminster Government, although that is important. It also calls on the  Government of Northern Ireland to take resolute action to maximise the use of  Post Office services by Government Departments. Before restoration, Members  often called on direct rule Ministers to address particular issues. Now, the  Assembly has its own Ministers who have the opportunity to take action on its  behalf. I hope that they will do so.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am sure that all Members in the Chamber will agree that  the post office is a key element of the local community, whether it is urban or  rural. To close a post office is to take  away from the identity of the community and to rob it of vital services,  from which it may never recover. I hope that the House will support the motion as amended and that the Executive will take  appropriate action in support of the Post Office network. Go raibh maith  agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I call Mr Paul Maskey. I remind Members that this will be Mr  Maskey&rsquo;s maiden speech in the Assembly. As Members are aware, it is the  convention that such a speech be made without interruption.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Maskey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. No pressure, then. I am glad that  I have the opportunity to say a few words on the motion and want to thank the Members who brought it before the  House.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The closure of 200 post offices does not only affect the  rural community; it has an adverse effect on the urban community as well,  although perhaps not to the same level. According to Advice NI&rsquo;s response to  the Post Office network consultation, the number of Post Office branches in the  North of Ireland is 540: 30% of them, around 160 offices, are in urban  communities, and 70%, around 380 offices, are in rural communities. Therefore,  almost a third of post offices are in an urban setting. The Government have yet  to say where the closures will take place,  so many could be in urban areas.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The local post office is, and should always be, at the  heart and soul of local communities, particularly those that are in rural and  disadvantaged urban areas. The closure of those post offices will be the death  knell for many villages and towns, when the magnet that draws people together  will be no more. The Assembly can discuss neighbourhood renewal, building up  communities and creating a strong infrastructure that will enable communities  to modernise; however, the British Govern&shy;ment want to pull the very heart out  of those communities.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">For many older people and, indeed, young parents who do not  have access to a car a visit to the post office can be a major ordeal. In many  cases, the service is being located further and further away from their  doorsteps. Many people whom I represent in West Belfast  simply cannot afford to pay to travel to the nearest post office and will be  disadvantaged when they must cover the cost of public or private transport to  get them there and back.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I am particularly concerned about what the adverse effect  will be on communities when many pensioners will lose their gathering place and  that essential service is removed. Many senior citizens use the post office as  a meeting place. For some, it is the sole reason that they have ventured  outdoors.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">4.00 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore the removal of that service would be a great  injustice. The Post Office network is in its current state because of  deliberate British Government policy. If that essential community service is to  survive, a U-turn in that policy is required.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">When the payment of benefits moved from payment books to  electronic accounts, post offices lost out dramatically as the Government  encouraged recipients to have their benefits paid into bank accounts. The loss  to convenience stores of NIE (Northern Ireland Electricity) power cards, saving  stamps for TV licences and other pre-payment cards was another blow to the  network. Therefore the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First  Minister (OFMDFM) and the councils should adopt a proactive approach by  advocating that Departments use post offices.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I support the motion and the amendment. Go raibh maith  agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I thank the Members who tabled this important  motion. I accept that the closure of post offices is probably a reserved  matter and still the preserve of the Government at Westminster. However, even at this early  stage of the debate, Members have heard about the importance of the issue and  the strength of feeling that clearly exists about the retention of urban and  rural post offices.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The wider argument about rural communities illustrates  ongoing concern for their future. The Labour Administration appear to be intent  on forcing people to live in towns and urbanised areas, effectively abandoning  the countryside. I share the views of the Ulster Farmers&rsquo; Union (UFU) and its  president, Mr Kenneth Sharkey, on the reduction of services that are available  to the rural community. Healthcare services are being centralised, and Members  need only read the Bain Report to see the uncertain future that is being mapped  out for rural schools.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is a reduction in the provision of emergency services  in rural areas, not least in my constituency of Newry and Armagh. There is a great need  for ambulance services in south Armagh,  but they are not provided. The planning process is in gridlock. The  introduction of PPS 14 and new area plan proposals combine to wreak havoc in  its administration. There is a reduced policing service in rural areas. Indeed,  it appears that we live in a country in which criminals break into police  stations and in which members of the Policing Board are known to the police in  all kinds of ways.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">All the above are  hammer blows to the rural com&shy;munity, but one of the principal blows is  the scaling down of local post offices. As Members heard earlier, the rural community generally has an ageing  population. As older people are perhaps not as electronically minded as  young people and may not have email, internet shopping or banking facilities  close to hand, they rely heavily on post offices to provide banking facilities.  Yet, increasingly, many services are being withdrawn, forcing people to have  their benefits paid into newly opened bank accounts and to pay their  electricity and phone bills by banking transfer.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">One by one, services that are critical to the viability of  post offices have been taken away, leaving the post offices in an almost  impossible position. The Government&rsquo;s policy may have merit in other parts of  the United Kingdom, but in Northern Ireland  it creates conditions whereby the rural community is being hopelessly  abandoned.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Just as people came to  regret the criminal destruction of the local railway network in the  1960s, there will be regret if the killing-off of rural post offices is  allowed. I support the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McQuillan</strong>:  The motion concerns an issue that will impact on every constituency in Northern Ireland.  The potential closure of approximately 200  post offices across the Province will have alarming consequences for the  whole community. Rural communities, in particular, are likely to be affected.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I hardly need to remind the House about the way in which  our rural communities have been adversely affected by a wide range of damaging  factors in recent times. Those factors include the general decline of  agriculture that has resulted in many people leaving the farming industry for  good; having to deal with the consequences of foot-and-mouth disease; BSE, and  a planning system that pays scant regard to the need to preserve and populate  the rural communities &mdash; something that has  been exacerbated by the introduction of the famous PPS 14 by direct rule  Ministers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Lack of housing is driving more people away from their home  communities, resulting in a fall in pupil numbers  in rural schools and inevitably leading to school closures. Other  factors include poor public transport, the commercial life of rural towns, and  villages being constantly challenged by large supermarkets and out-of-town  shopping centres.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That is the backcloth to the latest Government proposals  that could lead to the closure of 200 post offices, largely in rural  communities. Therefore, it is little wonder that many people see the proposal  as the final act in removing the heart from our towns and villages. Of course,  we all recognise that the post office is a business and must operate in a  commercial environment: no one denies that. Modernisation and change in the way  of operating are essential to all businesses in the twenty-first century.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, the post office means so much more to a community  than the mere measurement of commercial value in pounds and pence. The social  value that it brings to the community is much greater than that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Earlier in the year,  Postwatch Northern Ireland carried out a survey on people&rsquo;s attitudes in  rural areas to a number of issues regarding local post offices. The findings  were revealing. Seventy-three per cent of those surveyed used the local post office  at least once a week &mdash; that figure rose to 88% among those aged 55 and over.  More than one third got cash from the post office &mdash; that figure rose to 58%  among those aged 55 and over. Ninety-four  per cent regarded local post offices as important to their daily lives,  and 73% lived within a mile of the post office that they used most often.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Those figures underline the vital role that local post  offices play in the lives of those living in rural communities and emphasise  the need to ensure their retention. Of course, the question is: how can that be  achieved? Some way must be found to quantify the social value of post offices  in commercial terms. Who will pay for the social element, and through what  mechanism? I am convinced that central and local government in Northern Ireland  have a key role to play in helping to support the retention of post offices.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I support the call for an urgent and innovative programme  of action to be drawn up by the Executive. That programme should identify ways  in which local services could be contracted to post offices under service level  agreements. For example, dog licences and other charges due to local councils  could be paid at post offices. For a fee, post offices could be used as public-information points for tourism and other  services. The Civil Service must be encouraged to think outside the box  if the conditions are to be created whereby the retention of post offices can  be justified.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I hope Members will send a strong message back to our rural  constituencies that we recognise the immense difficulties that people face and  that we are determined to begin the long haul back to revitalising our rural  towns, villages and hamlets. The post office is vital to the aim of retaining  the heart of each community. Innovative, proactive measures can be identified  to achieve that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I urge the Executive to put this urgently needed programme  of action into place. Fine words are not enough. We need to show that further  decline is not inevitable. Rather, the saving of the post office could kick-start  the beginning of better days for our rural communities. I support the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. For the record, I declare an  interest as a former employee of the postal service. I welcome the motion and  the amendment and I thank the Members for proposing them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The loss of up to 200  post offices in the Six Counties will  have a devastating effect on rural and urban com&shy;munities and areas of  social disadvantage. According to the published criteria for identifying closures,  rural communities are the most vulnerable; the proposals by the British  Government will hit them hardest. It is vital that the social importance of the  Post Office network in rural communities is highlighted, and I welcome the  opportunity that the motion presents us to do that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The rural post office is not just a central part of the  community; it is an essential link, particularly for older people. Rural post offices provide a lifeline to  thousands of older people who would otherwise be isolated. In many areas  of social disadvantage, the post office provides a lifeline for people  struggling on benefits.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The apparent  determination of the British Government to undermine the future of the  Post Office network is a disgrace. The decisions to withdraw services such as  TV licence payments and the Post Office card accounts that people use to draw  pensions and other benefit payments have  had a devastating impact on the viability of the Post Office network.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In its previous incarnation, the Assembly made clear its  support for the Post Office network. The proposal of the motion, namely the  retention of post offices by advocating the use of their services for  governmental and council business, is both feasible and practical. I believe  that there is scope for the new Executive to respond imaginatively to the  threat in a way that supports and enhances the Post Office network and supports  rural and disadvantaged communities. The implementation of the proposals in the  motion will be a positive start. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  The Assembly has already heard that across  the United Kingdom, the Post Office network has been losing millions of  pounds over the last seven years. Even a Government subsidy of &pound;150 million  could not stop the rot.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Alistair Darling, the Secretary of State for Trade and  Industry, indicated that as part of the latest phase of rationalisation, up to  200 post offices across Northern    Ireland face closure and that the Government  subsidy would be withdrawn by 2008. That development places a considerable  number of local post offices in a precarious position, given that of the 8,000  rural post offices across the UK,  only 1,500 make any money.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Inevitably, the pressure of Government policy will now come  to bear on rural post offices, which are less productive than their urban  counterparts. Although value for taxpayers&rsquo;  money is important, the Government &mdash; in its haste to stem the losses  that the Post Office is sustaining &mdash; has lost its objectivity and abandoned a  fundamental commitment to provide maximum possible public access to Post Office  services.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">One trend that is  profoundly unhelpful to the main&shy;tenance of the network is the removal  of services from post offices. Revenue from the services that have been  withdrawn has fallen by a whopping &pound;168 million in the past year, which serves  only to compound the problems faced by sub-postmasters across the country. One  particular example is the plan to remove the Post Office card account. Across the UK,  including Norther<span style="letter-spacing:0pt; ">n Ireland</span>, 4.3 million people use their Post Office card  accounts to access benefit payments, yet moves are already afoot to wind the  system up. That completely disregards the wishes of customers to use the  service and ignores the implications for local post offices.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As other Members have stressed, post offices are a lifeline  for local communities, particularly in rural areas where closures will have  shattering social and economic effects. The latest announcement of a further  raft of closures is totally unacceptable. It is also economically short-sighted,  as any finances saved by the closures will  inevitably result in a dip in productivity by local small businesses,  which will ultimately lead to a loss of revenue.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">That view is supported by a survey that was carried out by  the Federation of Small Businesses, which found that 82% of the owners of small  firms were of the opinion that the closure of their local post offices would  adversely affect their businesses.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Although the economic  impact of widespread closures is undeniable, the repercussions are  infinitely more serious for the future cohesion of local communities and the  confidence that they require to survive.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">4.15 pm</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The independent monitoring organisation Postwatch  commissioned research that was published in January 2007 and which paints a clear  picture of how greatly local communities value post office services. Of those  surveyed, 21% were retired, seven out of 10 used a post office at least once a  week, and 82% were very or extremely  satisfied with the service. The most important aspect of that survey may  be the responses on the level of importance that people attach to their local  post offices. Some 94% of people believe that the post office is important to  them, and 78% stated that it is extremely or very important. Most pertinently,  that figure rises to 92% of people aged 55 or over, and 83% of females who were  surveyed believed their local post office to be extremely or very important. I  could go on, ad infinitum, about the importance of those responses, but it is  clear that post offices play a central role in the lives of rural communities.  To date, the closure of rural post offices  has had a profound impact on communities, and has hit the most  vulnerable in society &mdash; elderly people, the disabled and those with mobility  problems &mdash; particularly hard. I support the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I, along with party colleagues, welcome the motion and thank Mr Shannon for  raising this important matter in the Chamber.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">As my colleague Mr Kennedy pointed out, the closure of post  offices is another attack on rural communities by the Labour Government.  Members have considered the problems of rural communities in various Assembly  debates. I represent a large rural constituency, and I live and work in a rural  community. Therefore, I know at first hand of the effects of those problems on  rural areas. With the Assembly up and running, Members can move more speedily  on a proper rural-proofing agenda in which there are in-built protections for  rural schools, hospitals and transport, which are all linked effectively.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  I accept what the Member has said about rural communities, and how post office  closures will impact on them, but does the Member not believe that urban  communities and those who suffer the greatest deprivation will also be severely  affected?</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I have no difficulty or issue in accepting that, and I will speak shortly about  the amendment that Mr Bradley has tabled.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There are difficulties with the distances that people must travel to access Post Office services, and  earlier, in the debate on a  commissioner for older people, Members heard that 80,000 people live on  their own. That ties in with what Mr Bradley said about urban areas. There is  an important social aspect to rural post offices and the services that they  provide to local residents.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Post Office must attract as much business and interest  as possible, and other Members have spoken of the range of services that it  must offer. There are additional actions  that Government Departments can take. The  full-time and part-time employment that post offices offer to  hard-pressed rural communities is important.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I have no difficulty with the rural/urban context in which  your amendment is set, Mr Bradley. Notwithstanding Mrs Robinson&rsquo;s valid point  that the greatest threat is to rural post offices, we should not ignore the  urban ones.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I urge caution on the second part of the amendment, which  ties in Departments. Have you considered some of the cost implications of that?  Bearing in mind that it is not a devolved matter, and there is no money set  aside in the block grant, you must consider carefully before you bind  Departments, including that of your colleague the Minister for Social  Development &mdash;</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I remind the Member to address the Chair, not an individual  Member.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I apologise, Mr Deputy Speaker.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Notwithstanding that point about the risks of Departments  being tied into financing things, and the cost implications of that for the  Departments and for the Assembly, I have no issue with supporting this worthwhile  motion. Post offices play a huge part in rural communities, so I support the  motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>: I support the motion and the amendment. If the post office  issue is not addressed, Postman Pat will be gone forever &mdash; and I do not mean  the cartoon.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Useful debates took place in the previous Assembly. It is  not new to suggest that Departments could play a vital role in sustaining post  offices. Members may wish to know that a pilot scheme was envisaged for  Coleraine, and officials from the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy  First Minister addressed the borough council on that issue.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Unfortunately, other matters took precedence. The Assembly  was suspended, and more and more post offices have closed in the meantime. Most  closures have happened in rural areas, but there have been some in suburban areas also. That has inflicted some  financial hazard on people, if we take into account the cost of taking  taxis into city centres, and so on. We must not underestimate the loss to our  friends in urban and suburban areas.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Long debates have taken place at Westminster,  and so-called solutions have been found, all of which have failed to recognise  the unique role that the post office plays in the lives of people in Northern Ireland &mdash; and in the Republic of Ireland.  Sadly, because of partition, we do not have the level of discussion that could  take place to come up with a shared solution for both North and South. The problems relating to the future of  the post offices are exactly the  same in the North and the South.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We are compelled to work to a model that was designed for  large urban areas in Britain.  For example, we must send our complaints to Glasgow. That may be fine for Celtic or Rangers supporters, but, for  those of us who depend on the post office, it would be nice to have  somewhere more convenient to lodge our complaints.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Post offices cannot survive as agents of Government  services alone. There must be investment in new technology and an extension of  the range of services provided. For example, in small towns where there is no  police station, post offices could deal with routine police matters, such as  reporting lost property or processing documents and other matters for follow-up  later. It is only an idea; do not panic.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The post office could be a communications centre for  Internet services. It could also extend its range of services in other  commercial operations. Given political will and commitment, there is no reason  why post offices should disappear.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In Northern    Ireland there are unique opportunities to  retain post offices for the payment of Government benefits to customers. Members have already mentioned that.  Unfortunately, Government Departments have shown a remarkable lack of interest  in the seriousness of losing our post offices. I would like to shout from the  rooftops to our 11 Government Departments and other agencies to make a  concerted effort to embrace the uniqueness of the Post Office and give it the  oxygen of life, which it urgently needs.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We can stand idly by; we can choose to do nothing and allow  the post offices to die a slow and painful death. Then it will be the turn of  banks in rural areas, and some day, sooner rather than later, we will find that  there are no shops in our rural towns and villages &mdash; no anything &mdash; and it will  be too late. Is that what we want for the next generation? I think not. It  should be remembered that 40% of small towns and villages in Britain now  have no post office, bank, butcher or baker &mdash; no anything.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Out of this debate should arise a plan or strategy to  enable action to speak louder than words. Let us talk to our neighbours in the  South and share our concerns and our solutions. Let us put an end to the  scandal whereby a letter from Derry takes a  week to be delivered to Muff, three miles down the road. Let us find a common solution  to a common problem: how to save our post offices. Let the action begin. I  support the motion, although I hope that it will be amended.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Armstrong</strong>:  The motion relates to the vital importance of our rural communities. I am sure  that Members realise that rural communities have become increasingly threatened  in recent years. As Mr Bradley has said, while urban post offices are also  under threat, the main problem lies in rural communities.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The rural way of life  has been under threat in various ways for some time. The farming  industry is the backbone of the rural community, and I scarcely need to dwell  on the difficulties that agriculture has faced in the last ten years. They  include falling prices, BSE and foot-and-mouth disease. Farmers, and industries  situated in rural areas, have faced all these pressures.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Soaring house prices also have a serious effect on rural  communities. They make it almost impossible for people &mdash; particularly young  people &mdash; to find accommodation in the villages where their families have lived  for generations. Members should not forget that, in the midst of this already  critical situation, our esteemed direct rule Ministers saw fit to impose  Planning Policy Statement 14, which has had a serious effect on rural  communities.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">To add to these factors, and largely as a result of them,  many rural communities have seen enrolments in local schools decline. Many  rural schools are now threatened with closure, just as post offices are. Such  schools are the bedrock of our communities.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I could go on, but I trust that I have shown that rural  communities are already dealing with a range of problems and challenges. On top  of all that, we now face the problem of losing almost 200 post offices in Northern Ireland,  most of them situated in rural areas. That is not acceptable. Rural post  offices are a vital part of the fabric of rural life and must remain open.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Last month the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) said  that:</p>
	      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Post Offices are a life line for local communities  particularly in rural areas and their  closure would have a devastating effect on local economies and their  spending patterns. The loss of post offices will have an immeasurable impact  throughout the effected communities &hellip; This action is completely unacceptable  and very short-sighted.&rdquo;</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The FSB points out that, in addition to the many  individuals who will be greatly inconvenienced by these closures, 82% of small  businesses reported that the closure of local post offices would have an  adverse effect on them.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Like the rural  community, post offices have been under threat for some time, as various  functions have been gradually taken from them, making them even more difficult  to operate. I have no hesitation in calling on the First Minister and the  Deputy First Minister to use their powers  to support the retention of our post offices.</p>
	      <p class="TimePeriod">4.30 pm</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First Minister (Rev Dr Ian Paisley)</strong>: Members are well aware that the Post  Office is the primary responsibility of the Department of Trade and Industry.  Decisions on the future of the Post Office network are not ones, unfortunately,  that we can make. Perhaps it is fortunate that someone else will make those  decisions, but we would like to be able to make them. If we were making the  decisions, we would do our best to save the post office system, but that is  beyond us. However, we must have a strategy to impress on the Secretary of  State for Trade and Industry the very strong feelings of the people of Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Today&rsquo;s debate has  amply demonstrated the concerns our communities have about the future of  the Post Office network. Many people, particularly the most vulnerable in our  society, depend on the post offices and the service they deliver. They are part  of their life and well-being. The Post Office is about more than delivering  mail, although that is critical. It is about managing finances, paying bills,  buying stationery and goods in a friendly local shop and accessing important  forms for a wide range of Government services. Those services are important to  the community, especially to the aged and those who need help filling in forms  in a world that has gone wild for form filling.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In the House of Commons recently, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, Alistair Darling,  announced his proposals for the future of the network. I pay tribute to  the fact that he approached the Northern Ireland Members of Parliament, and we  put to him matters that gave us concern. We are concerned about the plan that  he has for Northern Ireland  post offices, and we must be given that plan in good time. However, we do not  know what that plan is. I asked Mr Darling for the number of post offices, and  he could not give me the number. I asked him where those post offices were, and  he said that he did not know.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I told Mr Darling that he did not know where &ldquo;A hog hill&rdquo; is,  but I know that it is called &ldquo;Ahoghill&rdquo;. That is the ignorance of the people  who are handling some of the affairs of Northern Ireland.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Immediately the plan for the future of the Post Office  network is available, Members of the House should study it carefully, list  their objections and put them forcibly to the Government.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First  Minister (OFMDFM) played an important role in co-ordinating the views of all  Departments on the Department of Trade and Industry&rsquo;s plans as they were being  developed. Indeed, the Government&rsquo;s acknowledgement of the social role of post  offices reflects the strong representations that have been made. Mr Darling  said that he wants to give the devolved Administrations a greater say in shaping  the network of the future, and we certainly want to have a say, because we had  no say in the past.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">We note the amendment  calling for cross-departmental strategies to maximise the use of post  offices by Departments. We will certainly continue to work with the other Northern Ireland Departments,  particularly with those with a direct interest in the Post Office, such  as the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development and the Department for  Social Development. The potential of post  offices to deliver public services can form part of that work.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In response to Mr Shannon, Mr Dominic Bradley and Mr Alban  Maginness, I say that OFMDFM understands that the Social Security Agency  remains committed to allowing people to access their pensions or benefits in  cash at post offices if they choose to do so. However, OFMDFM has received  legal advice that states that EU procurement law prevents the extension of the  Post Office card account contract with Post Office Ltd. Instead, there must be  a transparent procurement exercise allowing  all contenders, including post offices, to express an interest. Those  matters must be fully ventilated, and we must know what the answers are in law.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, we must be realistic about what can be achieved.  In the past, a number of exercises considered additional services that could be  offered, including pensions and car tax. Those exercises demonstrated that the  range of services capable of generating income was limited, particularly where  post offices are located in sparsely populated areas. Furthermore, Departments  cannot simply allocate major commercial undertakings to outside bodies,  including the Post Office, without appropriate and transparent public  procurement procedures, nor would it be possible for OFMDFM to direct them to  do so.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">However, there are other potential developments to which we  can look forward. For example, the UK Government is now looking towards  expanding the role of the Post Office as a provider of personal financial  services. It must also be for post offices themselves to consider other  services that they could offer in order to help their customers.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The aim of OFMDFM must be to help lay the foundations of a  viable and stable network of post offices that will protect and support the  well-being of those people most in need of the services that they offer. I  assure the House that we will seek to play a full part in that work and that  OFMDFM will work with everyone who has an interest. For that reason, I am happy  to support the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. T&aacute; an-&aacute;thas orm achoimri&uacute; a  dh&eacute;anamh ar na harg&oacute;int&iacute; a rinneadh anseo inniu ar son an leasaithe. I am  pleased to make the winding-up speech on the amendment. Various arguments have  been made in support of the amendment from both sides of the House. There were  minor differences, but there is a general air of agreement with different  emphases here and there. That is a good thing, as it indicates a degree of  unity.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member for West Belfast Mr Maskey outlined the need for  the protection of urban post offices. That is a crucial aspect of the  amendment. He underlined the fact that the older population in urban areas  depend on post offices and said that, in many cases, the post office was a  lifeline for them, as it is for many people in rural areas.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Boylan, a previous employee of the Post Office, has some  experience of the issues on the ground. He highlighted the devastating effect  that post office closures would have in rural areas. He said that the  conditions governing closure indicate that rural areas would be hit the  hardest, and I accept that point.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Boylan also mentioned the fact that areas of social  disadvantage will suffer the most, and I agree with him on that point. In fact,  it will be the people who depend most on post offices and need them most, both  in rural and urban communities, who will be hit hardest by closures.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My colleague Mr Dallat mentioned the previous OFMDFM  strategy, when officers and staff from that office advocated, in various rural  outreach settings, the use of post office services at local councils, etc. Mr  Dallat also suggested that post offices could, in this modern age of  communication, become centres for Internet use. He further suggested that  certain aspects of policing services, such as clerical work, could be delegated  to post offices. He called for Departments to make full use of postal services,  and for the Assembly to work in close harmony with the Republic of Ireland  to find common solutions to the problems that post offices are facing.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">In my speech, I  outlined some of the services that are needed  to bolster up our post offices for future viability. These included a  full suite of banking services to be available in post offices. I also  mentioned the need for present Post Office card account holders to be  transferred to the new accounts that are available.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">There is also a dire need for much investment in the Post  Office estate and for full training for sub-postmasters. Recently, I spoke to  some rural sub-postmasters who emphasised the need for linkages between post  offices and the high street banks.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I appreciate the commitment from the Minister for Social  Development, who investigated the possibility of delivering benefits through  the Northern Ireland  postal network. I hope that her investigations meet with success.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I also appreciate the commitment from the First Minister to  do all in his power to ensure that post offices survive. I realise that this is  not a devolved matter, but there is much that can be done through OFMDFM to  support the post offices.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">My amendment is in no way aimed at negating the motion;  rather, I sought to include the urban communities in the debate. They should be  included because they will suffer too. The second part of my amendment was  meant to strengthen the motion.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member should draw his remarks to a close.</p>
	      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  I welcome the debate and thank all those who have contributed &mdash; it has been  positive and constructive.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">The sad reality is that some 2,500 post offices, both urban  and rural, are earmarked for closure across the United Kingdom. I listened  carefully to the First Minister. He made it clear, and rightly so, that the  responsibility on the future of post offices does not lie with OFMDFM. I  suspect that if it did, a better outcome could be expected. However, the sad  reality is that the responsibility lies elsewhere.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that Mr Bradley, having listened to the debate, will  now withdraw his amendment. I suspect that he will, as he is normally quite  reasonable. I would not want him to change now, and I am sure that he does not  want to change either. <em>[Laughter.]</em></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, I hope that the House will unite in favour of  the motion that has been well debated and deliberated on. I hope that everyone  will take cognisance of that.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I hope, too, that we will see maintained in Northern Ireland  a network of post offices that serves both urban and rural communities. We have  heard much today, and rightly so, about the elderly &mdash; we had a good debate on  the commissioner for older people &mdash; but any closures in the Post Office network  will affect the elderly most.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">It is in rural communities that the impact of closures will  be felt most severely. It has been said that the post office is the heartbeat  of a rural community and I believe that to be true. Many things are delivered  through the local post office. In rural communities in particular, people look  to their post office. Rural post offices deliver a superb service. They have  become part of the infrastructure of rural Northern Ireland, but we are now on  the verge &mdash; the very edge &mdash; of seeing all of that change.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyText">I will not say much more lest I detract from what has  already been said &mdash; I have five or six foolscap pages remaining in my speech,  but much of it has already been delivered &mdash; so I say simply that the House should  unite on maintaining our rural and urban Post Office network. To those who  would use this opportunity to score political points, I say that today is not  the time and there will be plenty of other such opportunities in future. Today,  Members should put their community first by uniting on the motion, which I  commend to the House.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question, <span style="font-style:normal; ">That the  amendment be made,</span> put and agreed to.<strong><span style="font-style:normal; "> </span></strong></p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Main Question, as amended, put and agreed to.</p>
	      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
	      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly notes the grave threat to rural and urban  communities with the closure of up to two hundred Post Offices in Northern  Ireland, and calls upon the Office of First Minister and Deputy First Minister  to formulate an effective strategy on a cross-departmental basis to maximise  the use of postal services by government departments.</p>
