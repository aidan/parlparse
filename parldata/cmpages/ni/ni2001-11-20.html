                morning there was to be a motion pertaining to the serious
                situation at Bombardier Shorts. Is it in order to ask why that
                motion was withdrawn?</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is unfortunate that, from time to time,
                some change may arise in the circumstances of someone who has a
                motion on the Order Paper, after the Business Committee has
                agreed the Order Paper but before it is printed. It may concern
                a Member who is tabling a motion, a Minister with an item of
                business, or a particular clause of a Bill, with the result that
                that item of business must be withdrawn. It can even happen that
                items of business that are on the Order Paper do not proceed for
                various reasons.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As far as the particular circumstances are
                concerned, I would prefer that those issues did not become a
                matter of substantial debate in the Chamber. There is, of
                course, no reason why the Business Committee could not discuss
                such a matter.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fourth meeting of the North/South
                Ministerial Council (NSMC) in the tourism sectoral format took
                place in Dublin on Wednesday 7 November 2001. After nomination
                by the then First Minister and the then Deputy First Minister,
                Dr Seán Farren and I represented the Northern Ireland
                Administration. The Irish Government were represented by Dr
                James McDaid TD, Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation.
                This report has been approved by Dr Farren and is also made on
                his behalf.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Andrew Coppel, chairman of Tourism Ireland
                Ltd, presented a progress report to the council on developments
                since the last tourism sector meeting. Mr Coppel reported that,
                after an open recruitment process, Mr Paul O’Toole formally
                took up his position as chief executive of Tourism Ireland Ltd
                on 16 July 2001. Mr Coppel also gave an update on recruiting
                staff to new positions in the company and on progress on the
                company’s new premises in Dublin and Coleraine. Mr Coppel
                reported that the board of Tourism Ireland Ltd had formulated a
                comprehensive marketing programme for the 2002 season, together
                with the creation of new marketing communication materials. Mr
                Coppel also informed the Council that a tourism marketing
                partnership had been formed with members of the tourism industry
                to assist Tourism Ireland Ltd in its strategic thinking.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council noted that preparation of the
                Tourism Ireland Ltd corporate plan had commenced. It is intended
                that the plan will be submitted for approval at the next meeting
                of the North/South Ministerial Council in this sector.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council received a verbal report from Mr
                O’Toole on developments since his appointment in July. That
                covered issues such as market conditions in the tourism industry
                after the events of 11 September and the objectives and strategy
                of the company for the 2002 marketing campaign. The Council
                assured Mr O’Toole of its support in meeting the significant
                challenges facing the company.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Farren gave the Council an update on the
                progress made on the tourism training initiatives that were
                discussed at earlier meetings, such as the business renewal for
                hospitality and tourism operators programme, the operational
                skills development programme and the scheme facilitating the
                exchange of teachers, educationalists, trainers and
                practitioners.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council agreed that its next meeting in
                tourism sectoral format would take place in Northern Ireland in
                February 2002.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the Minister advise the House if a
                location has been identified for the Northern Ireland
                headquarters based in Coleraine? Has recruitment begun, and when
                is the Coleraine office likely to open?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Significant progress has been made in
                establishing the Coleraine office. Discussions between Tourism
                Ireland Ltd, the Valuation and Lands Agency and the developer
                are almost complete. Tourism Ireland Ltd wishes to ensure that
                the Coleraine office is a fully functional regional office,
                including reception, necessary information technology
                infrastructure and the ability to meet the trade and to support
                future board meetings.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Owing to the technical requirements of the
                information technology role in Coleraine, costs are still being
                calculated. Temporary premises have been identified in the New
                Row area, at numbers 34 to 36b, and will be available from 1
                December 2001. Coleraine will have 16 staff with responsibility
                for information technology, direct marketing, printing and
                distribution, financial and administrative support for Coleraine,
                call centre management and public relations. It is expected to
                take approximately four to five months to build the new
                structure with the specific information technology requirements
                that are necessary. In the meantime, temporary facilities will
                be available. Some staff are already transferring. Two have been
                identified so far. The total complement will be 16.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dallat:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Representing as I do the North’s number one
                tourist area, which includes Coleraine, I welcome the Minister’s
                interest in that area. Can he give the number of people, North
                and South, participating in the training programmes that he has
                announced? Has any evaluation taken place? What relationship
                will the new tourism company have with the regional tourism
                organisations (RTOs)?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I see that the last two Members are impartial
                in their opinions of the tourism potential of Coleraine.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Regional tourism organisations remain a
                significant tool in the delivery of a successful tourism policy.
                Tourism Ireland Ltd has already engaged with them directly. As
                far as I know, the chief executive and his colleagues have been
                to see most of the RTOs and have explained their ideas to them.
                One measure of the company’s success will be its ability to
                build strong partnerships with the RTOs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall have to defer to my Colleague, Dr
                Farren, regarding numbers on training programmes. I shall write
                to the Member with those details. Dr Farren will confirm that
                the response has been exceptionally positive, and we are very
                pleased. Some of the schemes are oversubscribed, particularly as
                regards graduates. The Council of Education, Recruitment and
                Training (CERT), which is the Republic of Ireland’s equivalent
                body for dealing with training in the tourism and hospitality
                sector, and the Department for Employment and Learning have
                worked very closely together. The schemes have advanced more
                quickly than expected since our meeting in Letterkenny, and we
                expect a positive outcome. Dr Farren’s Department and CERT
                will monitor the results, and I am sure that those can be made
                available to Members.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McElduff:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle.
                Cuirim fáilte roimh an chruinniú agus roimh an ráiteas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the meeting, the statement and Mr O’Toole’s
                appointment as chief executive of Tourism Ireland Ltd. Does the
                comprehensive marketing programme include a focus on cultural
                tourism? Have the Minister’s thoughts on market conditions
                developed in the wake of the events of 11 September?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr O’Toole and Mr Coppel reported on events
                after 11 September, and it will come as no surprise that there
                has been a significant impact. Air traffic and passenger
                movements in the United States immediately dropped by 90%, as
                did confidence in the market. Approximately 25% of the seats on
                flights across the Atlantic have now gone.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This period, like spring, is called the
                shoulder of the season, and it is being used increasingly to
                bolster tourism earnings. Undoubtedly, there will be a
                significant fall-off, and there is no way of sweeping that under
                the carpet. The precise extent varies among sectors, and the
                full picture will not be available until statistics are
                collected.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Cultural tourism is an area with significant
                growth potential. Marketing plans are still being established,
                but it is obvious that we can offer culture-related and
                heritage-related tourism. We believe that it is attractive to
                visitors from North America and Europe. Last year, we had a
                substantial increase in tourism from France, and it was in the
                area of natural resource-based cultural heritage, gardens, and
                visits to historical sites. Cultural tourism will be one of the
                growth areas of the future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall briefly return to Mr Dallat’s
                question, because I was not quick enough with my notes. I do
                have some statistics on participating numbers. However, in view
                of the different categories it would still be better to provide
                details in writing.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr J Wilson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister will be aware that August was a
                particularly disastrous month for the tourism industry. I
                believe that Americans are in the habit of booking holidays in
                February and March. At that time of the year, we were in the
                middle of the foot-and-mouth disease crisis. Action must be
                taken to attract lost business back to Northern Ireland; it will
                not happen of its own accord. Are there plans to make the
                industry more buoyant?</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">10.45 am</p>
                </i><b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member has identified one of this year’s
                twin problems. The foot-and-mouth disease outbreak happened in
                the spring — I think in February. Many holidays are booked
                during March and April. Undoubtedly, there was a significant
                downturn in business, with figures of 10% to 15% mentioned.
                However, until the season is over, and statistics are analysed,
                it will be difficult to determine the exact amount of decline.
                Moreover, a complete cut-off point was reached as a result of
                the events of 11 September.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The North/South Ministerial Council has
                discussed the problem at great length. The chairperson and the
                chief executive of Tourism Ireland Ltd are focused on that
                issue. They have set out an ambitious, but thoughtful, marketing
                programme for the coming season. Members will be impressed with
                it. It is intelligent, with Tourism Ireland Ltd retaining a
                degree of flexibility. The company does not commit its entire
                budget to any one sector. It will hold back some resources so
                that it can react as events occur. However, using the Gulf War
                in 1991 as a yardstick to measure how quickly the American
                market can recover, it took three to four full seasons. That was
                taken into account on the marketing plans.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We shall not attract the same volume of
                business from North America. Therefore, we must attract more
                business from closer to home. That means refocusing additional
                marketing in Great Britain. There will be a specific marketing
                strategy for Scotland and the north of England, as those areas
                attract the most visitors. We shall also refocus to a degree on
                Europe because, although there have not been the same flight
                difficulties, huge access problems exist. That is another major
                issue.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for his report. Members
                are interested in the outlook for 2002 and must be satisfied
                with predictions. Many people want to know when Tourism Ireland
                Ltd will begin to make an impact. That is its first test.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another important issue is the relationship
                between the Tourism Ireland Ltd offices abroad, the IDB offices
                and the Executive Information Service offices in Washington and
                Brussels. Will an integrated approach be adopted to maximise the
                benefits as widely as possible?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If things go according to plan, the transfer
                of staff from Bord Fáilte and the Northern Ireland Tourist
                Board will formally take effect on 1 September. For the first
                time, the company will have its own staff. The transfer of
                people from the overseas offices to Tourism Ireland Ltd will
                take effect from 1 December.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The future of the overseas offices has not
                been determined. The Council will return to the issue at its
                next meeting, because several instances of duplication have
                arisen. Some of the offices are located in embassy buildings,
                whereas Tourism Ireland Ltd’s approach will be market driven
                and commercially focused. Therefore offices must be established
                with that in mind. At the moment, the Industrial Development
                Board (IDB) has a network in North America and one or two
                offices in other parts of the world. However, those offices are
                not specifically linked to tourism. Tourism Ireland Ltd is a
                joint company owned by the two tourist boards.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">New York is still one of the best places to
                have an office — it would be inconceivable not to have one
                there. We would need some convincing that Washington would be a
                suitable location for a tourism base — we do not even have an
                Industrial Development Board office there. However, when the
                Executive office in Washington is opened we expect the IDB to
                make use of it, although that may not be on a permanent basis. I
                note the point and will mention it to the company, but there are
                no plans to develop a totally integrated approach with the
                Tourism Ireland Ltd offices. I can, however, foresee
                circumstances where the Brussels and Washington offices could
                have a gateway into both of those sectors.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall call one further Member, but I wish
                to make a comment that is more for the benefit of Members who
                are not here than those who are. Ministers have generally been
                good about making statements to the House rather than making
                them outside first. That should be appreciated and respected.
                Statements are made to provide information and to give Members
                an opportunity to ask questions. Therefore in future I do not
                intend to call Members to ask questions on ministerial
                statements if they have not been here for ministerial
                statements. It is clear that those Members do not intend to ask
                questions on the statement but on a subject that takes their
                fancy. If Ministers are good enough to come to the House to make
                statements rather than make them outside, Members ought to be
                good enough to be in the Chamber to hear the statement on which
                they can ask a question. That is a warning for the future, and I
                hope that Members will transmit that to erring absent Members.</p>

                monitor and saw the Minister speaking, I was afraid that I would
                miss something in my rush down to the Chamber, so I stayed to
                watch the speech on the monitor. That way I made sure that I did
                not miss anything in the Minister’s statement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am impressed by the marketing angles. I was
                also impressed by what the Minister said about the need to focus
                on Europe. The same air flight difficulties do not exist in
                Europe as in the United States. The Minister will know what my
                question will be. What accommodation will be made for the fact
                that the euro is being introduced? Is Tourism Ireland Ltd making
                any plans to accommodate the euro, with foreign tourists in
                mind?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member has combined ingenuity in
                introducing the matter and predictability in asking the
                question. As the Member knows, my Department is responsible,
                through the euro preparations forum, for ensuring that
                businesses are aware of the implications of the introduction of
                the euro in January. Tourism Ireland Ltd does not have a
                responsibility in that regard, for, although the Republic is
                introducing the euro and we are not, it is still the
                responsibility of individual businesses to prepare. However,
                Tourism Ireland Ltd and the respective tourist boards have been
                anxious to ensure that customers can be accommodated. With
                effect from January, customers in the European Union have a
                right to be accommodated. Therefore, if businesses fail to
                follow the guidance that we have issued or to take up our offers
                of help, they will fail as businesses because they are obliged
                to be able to take payments and make appropriate arrangements in
                euros with effect from January. Tourism Ireland Ltd is trying to
                market in two currencies. That is a difficult problem to tackle.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The literature that is being prepared will
                make specific reference to currencies. It will point out the
                differences and try to offer the best advice to potential
                visitors by ensuring that they are fully informed. Similarly,
                industry is being kept informed of the proposed contents of the
                literature and the web site so that it can be prepared. However,
                individual businesses have an obligation to ensure that they can
                accommodate our visitors. They will be in default if they do
                not.</p>

                (SR 319/2001) be approved.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall refer to those Regulations as the
                part-time workers Regulations. They were laid before the
                Assembly on 12 September 2001, came into operation on 21 October
                2001, and are subject to confirmation by the Assembly within six
                months of the latter date.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Regulations amended the Part-time Workers
                (Prevention of Less Favourable Treatment) Regulations (Northern
                Ireland) 2000, which implemented European Union Directive
                97/81/EC, as extended to the UK by Directive 98/23/EC, in
                Northern Ireland. The aim of this essentially technical
                amendment is to enable the Labour Relations Agency to conciliate
                in industrial tribunal cases brought under the part-time workers
                Regulations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Under the Industrial Tribunals (Northern
                Ireland) Order 1996, the Labour Relations Agency may conciliate
                between parties to certain employment disputes, and, if both
                parties agree, reach binding agreements that obviate the need
                for a tribunal hearing. However, the Labour Relations Agency is
                granted that power only in respect of disputes relating to
                specified employment legislation. The list of such legislation
                did not cover disputes relating to certain provisions of the
                Part-time Workers (Prevention of Less Favourable Treatment)
                Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2000. The Regulations before the
                Assembly today will enable the Labour Relations Agency to
                conciliate in that jurisdiction also. In other words, these
                Regulations effectively make good an omission relating to the
                jurisdiction of the Labour Relations Agency in certain
                provisions of those Regulations. I commend the Regulations to
                the Assembly.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Committee for
                Employment and Learning (Dr Birnie):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On behalf of the Committee, I welcome the
                approval of this statutory rule. The Committee considered the
                rule on 11 October 2001, together with the report from the
                Examiner of Statutory Rules, and the Committee had no objection
                to the rule. As the Minister said, the statutory rule is a
                technical amendment to primary legislation, and it gives new
                powers to the Labour Relations Agency to conciliate on claims
                where part-time workers allege that they have suffered a
                grievance at work.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At present such cases must go directly to an
                industrial tribunal. The Committee welcomes the proposal because
                it will take pressure off the tribunal system.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee shares the concern raised by
                many people about the increase in the number of cases that went
                through tribunals in the past decade. The Committee for
                Employment and Learning will scrutinise how this legislation and
                other improvements relating to the tribunal system help both
                employers and employees, so that a speedier resolution can be
                achieved. However, the Committee wants reassurance that the
                Labour Relations Agency has received, or will, if necessary,
                receive, the extra resources needed to carry out this function
                effectively. Subject to that caveat, I add the Committee’s
                support to the motion.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dallat:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a Member of the Committee for Employment
                and Learning and as someone with an interest in equality, I too
                welcome the motion. It will enable the Labour Relations Agency
                to help to settle disputes in the workplace. Indeed, I will take
                this opportunity to say that the performance of the Labour
                Relations Agency has been very satisfactory in recent times.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important that part-time workers have
                the same rights and protection as their full-time colleagues.
                For too long part-time workers were the Cinderellas of the
                workplace. This statutory rule proposes equality for a group
                that has suffered terrible injustices in the past, often
                resulting in personal hardship not only for individuals but also
                for their families. At a time when more and more people are
                employed part time — sometimes by choice, but often through
                necessity — it is critical that their human rights are
                protected in the same way as those of full-time workers. There
                never was, nor should there ever have been, any excuse for
                treating workers differently, but part-time workers have on
                occasions been exploited in the most appalling ways.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us send out a clear message that the age
                of equality is arriving — slowly, but surely — and that the
                Assembly is determined to eliminate all forms of social and
                legal injustice so that the principles enshrined in the Good
                Friday Agreement apply to everyone. Part-time workers have been
                treated badly by both the Government and the private sector.
                That should now end. We hope that all employers now follow the
                example of others who never differentiated between full-time and
                part-time workers, but treated them as people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Can the Minister tell us what percentage of
                industrial tribunal cases the Labour Relations Agency deals with
                successfully?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Farren:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the two Members who have spoken.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Workers who lodge an industrial tribunal
                application under the Part-time Workers (Prevention of Less
                Favourable Treatment) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2001 will
                have the same right as in other jurisdictions to approach the
                Labour Relations Agency for assistance in reaching a conciliated
                settlement with their employers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In response to Mr Dallat’s question, the
                Labour Relations Agency facilitated a conciliated settlement in
                over 22% of all cases brought to industrial tribunals and played
                a key role in a significant proportion of the 33·5% of cases
                withdrawn. Obviously, access to the Labour Relations Agency for
                assistance in reaching a conciliated settlement can be quite
                effective and should, in all justice, be available to part-time
                workers as much as to full-time workers, as this amendment to
                the Regulations is intended to ensure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Regulations provide for greater choice for
                part-time workers and their employers in the way in which their
                cases are handled. They will afford them the opportunity to
                avoid the cost and inconvenience of a full hearing, if they
                wish. Any reduction in the number of cases needing to be heard
                by an industrial tribunal is also good news for the tribunal
                system itself. I can tell Dr Birnie that my Department will
                monitor the resource implications of any significant increase in
                the caseload of the Labour Relations Agency.</p>

                Health, Social Services and Public Safety to work towards the
                common validation and recognition of the qualifications of
                health and social services staff on a cross-border basis.</p>

                thank the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety
                for attending.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All Members are aware of the financial and
                staffing problems in the health sector. Recognition of
                qualifications on an all-island basis would give staff greater
                flexibility of movement. That would be especially important in
                the border counties, where hospitals and boards already work on
                a cross-border basis for the benefit of their patients. Such
                recognition of qualifications would remove the need for dual
                registration, which is time consuming and costly. It would also
                go some way towards tackling staff shortages, especially in
                positions that must be filled at short notice.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The current registration system prevents
                nurses from working throughout areas such as those covered by
                hospitals in Letterkenny and Derry or Sligo and Enniskillen.
                Everyone is aware that waiting lists are growing — in some
                cases, that is due to a shortage in nursing staff — and this
                small move would have long-term benefits for patients and would
                help to shorten waiting lists.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There have always been strong links between
                practitioners North and South; most difficulties concerned
                service delivery, which is affected by the registration
                situation. The British Medical Association (BMA) has written to
                welcome the commitment in the Programme for Government to
                develop areas for closer co-operation through the North/South
                Ministerial Council. The BMA asks for a cross-cutting study of
                the barriers that doctors face in North/South work. The BMA also
                wants clarification of any new all-Ireland system of
                registration of medical practitioners and of how such a system
                would solve the professional, legal and technical problems of
                working in both jurisdictions. The BMA also recognises the
                importance of sharing clinical expertise and experience and of
                co-operation in areas such as research and development. In
                September 2000 the BMA and the Irish Medical Organisation
                jointly hosted the first all-Ireland health conference.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Paramedics can work on both sides of the
                border as a good Samaritan act, and they have a good working
                relationship. However, there are some serious problems. Agreed
                training standards would benefit patients, especially in the
                border counties. I urge all parties to support this common-sense
                approach; it can only be of benefit to patients and staff.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCarthy:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Ramsey said, there is a crisis in almost
                every sector of Northern Ireland’s health and social services,
                including staff throughout the Health Service. The motion is
                worthy of support because, if implemented, health and social
                services staff throughout this island would be able to exercise
                their skills across Northern Ireland. Currently, health staff
                are being brought into our hospitals from the far corners of the
                world. Such staff are very welcome, and they contribute
                enormously to the welfare of all the people of Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the health spokesperson for the Alliance
                Party, I fully support the motion. Ms Ramsey mentioned the
                border counties; I would prefer to include all counties in
                Northern Ireland among those that would benefit from the
                proposal.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr J Kelly:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I
                too support the motion. As my Colleague has said, it will help
                to bring forward the harmonisation of healthcare throughout the
                island of Ireland. That is significant. It is not a political
                point. The health issue affects all of us who live on this
                island.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Considering the wider issue, with
                co-operation, major savings could be made in health benefits,
                particularly in the border counties. As Kieran McCarthy has
                said, that is not confined to the border areas but applies to
                the island of Ireland. That is especially true in relation to
                nursing and health and social services staff, because there is
                currently a shortage of nursing staff. Nurses are being brought
                in from the Philippines and from other Far Eastern countries to
                help to service the shortage of nurses in the island.
                Harmonisation, or fewer difficulties for nurses from one part of
                the island practising in another, would help to alleviate those
                shortages.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The shortages are an important issue, but the
                wider picture involves an attempt to bring some harmonisation to
                health provision. We looked at the fuel crisis, and we discussed
                harmonisation in that context, given the wide variation in fuel
                prices — petrol and diesel, et cetera — between the
                Twenty-six Counties and the Six Counties. The harmonisation of
                healthcare would have a much greater impact on the well-being of
                our citizens throughout the island of Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion, while it is confined to the issue
                of health and social services staff, widens the horizon and
                gives us an idea of how we might approach health on a 32-county,
                all-Ireland basis. I support the motion. We should give
                consideration to its wider implications for health provision.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Morrice:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion on the grounds that it
                makes sense. I must admit that I understood that in the single
                European market there was provision for the freedom of movement
                of goods, capital and services throughout the member states of
                the European Union.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Strenuous work has been conducted in Brussels
                to move towards the mutual recognition of diplomas and
                qualifications in all European Union countries. That would be
                important, not only on a cross-border, island of Ireland basis
                but on a Europe-wide basis. In a single market, people with
                qualifications should be able to move — whether it is to the
                Republic of Ireland, Italy, Greece, Portugal or anywhere in the
                European Union. In the early days there was mutual recognition
                of qualifications in hairdressing. That got through, but there
                is still much work to be done on other qualifications, such as
                pharmaceutical industry qualifications.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion not only on an
                all-Ireland basis but also on a Europe-wide basis.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Committee for Health,

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I congratulate Sue Ramsey on tabling the
                motion and apologise for not being in the House for her speech.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Co-operation and Working Together (CAWT) is a
                long-established co-operative venture. The CAWT project was set
                up in 1992 when the North Eastern and North Western Health
                Boards in the Republic, and the Southern and Western Health and
                Social Services Boards in Northern Ireland, entered into formal
                arrangements. That was the Ballyconnell Agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important to work towards the common
                validation and recognition of the qualifications of health and
                social services staff on a cross-border basis. Nurses are the
                backbone of any health service, and that is true of Northern
                Ireland, where there are major problems in the Health Service.
                There are grades for nurses, social workers and others. It is
                not irrelevant to note that many nurses in the Ulster Hospital
                and elsewhere are working at higher grades and have more
                responsibility than they are being paid for. It is important to
                sort out our own house. It is also important for cross-border
                issues. Nursing qualifications in the North are recognised in
                the Republic and vice versa, but educational qualifications in
                the North and South must be standardised.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Queen’s University is the only medical
                school in Northern Ireland, but there are several such schools
                in the Republic. Qualifications are recognised on both sides of
                the border and worldwide. The same goes for special needs,
                general medicine and surgery, but other qualifications such as
                diplomas may cause problems.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Doctors and general practitioners from the
                South work in Northern Ireland in primary care, and the same
                applies vice versa. The question of doctors being revalidated
                every few years is at the forefront of debate in the United
                Kingdom, including Northern Ireland, and parts of Western
                Europe. That will also apply to nurses and members of other
                professions. I am not sure what the position on revalidation is
                in the South, but that is something to be considered over the
                next couple of years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The North/South Ministerial Council set up
                the Obstacles to Mobility working group that dealt with
                standardisation and recognition of qualifications across the
                board. Ms Morrice made some comments about social workers. The
                social worker mobility study was part of that working group. The
                Northern Ireland Social Care Council was established on 1
                October 2001. Its primary role is to register and regulate the
                social care workforce and to draw up codes of practice for
                social care workers and their employers. The council was set up
                to redress the lack of qualifications among social care staff
                here. Bearing in mind that 80% of the 30,000 social care staff
                in Northern Ireland have no relevant qualifications, the
                cross-border mobility study was undertaken for the National
                Social Work Qualifications Board in the South and the Central
                Council for Education and Training in Social Work in Northern
                Ireland. The aim of the research was to analyse social work
                training courses on both sides of the border to identify any
                differences between them and to examine, in particular, social
                policy, social delivery structure and law. The ultimate aim of
                the project is to facilitate the cross-border mobility of social
                workers through the development of a teaching tool to bridge any
                gaps in training between the two jurisdictions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The most significant difference between
                training for social work in each jurisdiction was that, in
                general, courses in the Republic lasted longer than courses in
                the North.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Among the recommendations for facilitating
                cross- border mobility was the creation of a system of cross-
                border exchange placements, an idea that was generally well
                received on both sides. It was suggested that intensive seminar
                exchanges, and the sharing of information, should continue.
                Recommendations were also made in regard to the contents of the
                resource pack, social services systems and Government
                structures.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is still much work to be done, but
                progress is being made. The Minister of Health, Social Services
                and Public Safety has the support of the House in carrying out
                this useful work.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Savage:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When dealing with such issues as the
                validation of qualifications, we should think in broader terms,
                beyond an all-Ireland approach. Recently, the all- Ireland
                approach has proved beneficial in dealing with foot-and-mouth
                disease. Everyone is concerned about health, and the all-Ireland
                approach to such matters of common concern as healthcare is
                always sensible, but we must also think in European terms.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Surely there is parity of qualifications
                between member states? Recently, Spanish doctors and nurses were
                recruited to the beleaguered English Health Service. Their
                medical qualifications, therefore, were acceptable. Is the
                motion really necessary? Surely protocols exist for the
                recognition of all qualifications obtained in EU member states?
                Are we saying that those protocols are inadequate? There is a
                sound reason for their existence: to ensure genuine
                comparability of qualifications between member states.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Health, Social Services and
                Public Safety should indicate whether she is satisfied that
                those protocols are effective. If they are, why change them? On
                an administrative level it may be simpler to change them, so
                that those from the South may apply more easily for jobs in the
                Health Service here. However, does that not discriminate against
                those with equivalent qualifications from other member states
                such as Germany, France or Spain? The Minister for Employment
                and Learning could no doubt advise us on that. However, we must
                be mindful that we do not breach European regulations by giving
                favoured member status to the Republic of Ireland over other
                member states.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Should there not be protective measures for
                those who have already qualified in Northern Ireland?
                Comparability of qualifications is all right in itself, but
                those who qualify in our own system must be protected. If there
                is a shortage of applicants for jobs, people will have to be
                recruited from other countries. However, if that is not the
                case, are we to allow those from elsewhere to slip into jobs in
                our system ahead of those who qualified in Northern Ireland?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have a duty of care to protect students
                who qualify in our own institutions in the job recruitment in
                our system. Our primary duty is to protect the welfare of the
                young people of Northern Ireland. We must not be seen to enact
                legislation that is contrary to EU regulations. Anything that
                can be done to bring the Health Service up to a more acceptable
                standard must be the priority of every Member.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am old enough to remember when work permits
                were necessary in order to get a job in the North. However, we
                now live in a global society in which people want to travel and
                gain experiences — they do not want bureaucracy to get in the
                way of their careers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion is useful in that it raises issues
                that affect all Departments. Since partition there have been
                many cases of hardship created and maintained by two sets of
                bureaucracy that sought to separate, differentiate and divide.
                Health has no respect for political borders. However, the
                absence of common validation and recognition of qualifications
                has created real hardship for the people who work in the Health
                Service and, more importantly perhaps, for the people who need
                the service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Cross-border bodies create opportunities to
                confront many issues relating to qualifications and training. As
                already mentioned, our membership of the EU endorses that fine
                principle and in many respects enables us to address the issue.</p>

                is made with expediency and effect on this issue, on education,
                on the legal system, on social services, and on many other
                issues that affect people’s lives daily.</p>

                Switzerland and Italy, where are the survivors buried? We must
                focus on the issue. We talk about where people should receive
                the medical treatment they need, and who is best equipped to
                administer it. However, if someone is the recipient of medical
                care, it does not matter who provides it, or where that person
                receives it, as long as he or she is receiving the best
                attention.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The point has been made that we live in a
                global society. We should view this issue in an all-Ireland and
                British Isles context and also, as Jane Morrice stated, in a
                European context. I want people to return to the Health Service
                in Northern Ireland. Members should recognise that there are a
                number of foreign nationals working in the Health Service, all
                of whom provide a service here that is not being provided by
                other people for different reasons. We should not be disparaging
                about Filipinos or anybody else. They have come here and they
                have done a job, and I think that they have done it very well.
                Anyone who has relatives in hospitals or nursing homes where
                those people are working will bear testament to that.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">By tabling the motion I did not intend to be
                disparaging about outsiders coming here to work. The motion aims
                to make it easier for people who gain qualifications in Belfast
                but who want to work in Louth to be able to work there. I was
                not criticising outsiders who come here to work.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr B Hutchinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not suggesting that Ms Ramsey said that.
                I am picking up on what other Members said when they mentioned
                Filipinos. I am saying that we should recognise the skills that
                those people have and what they do in the medical professions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a great deal of talk about
                qualifications. It is important that somebody who has qualified
                at Queen’s University can go to work in Dublin, Milan or
                elsewhere. That is their choice, and they are entitled to it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When I was growing up there was a notion
                about hospitals and nurses. People had a Florence Nightingale-
                syndrome conception about nursing. That has changed. Nowadays,
                young girls and young men do not see nursing as a profession
                that they want to go into because there are so many social
                problems. The Government did not put money into the Health
                Service in Northern Ireland over the past 30 years, and everyone
                knows what has happened.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A few weeks ago, when Belfast City Hospital
                staff were dealing with people involved in the anthrax scare at
                the Post Office, 46 people were lying on trolleys in corridors.
                That image is not one that would encourage people to work in the
                Health Service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nurses, doctors and medical staff are people’s
                first point of contact when entering an accident and emergency
                department, and they are often abused because there are no beds
                available or because patients cannot get immediate treatment. We
                must improve the Health Service to attract staff back — nurses
                do not want to stay in that situation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I gave blood yesterday here, and I spoke to
                one of the staff. She said that she had left the City Hospital
                to work for the Blood Transfusion Service because the abuse from
                patients and their relatives on the wards was increasing and
                that it was worse for her colleagues in accident and emergency.
                This is a result of a lack of proper Health Service funding over
                the past 30 years.</p>

                in the United Kingdom because the Health Service has been run
                down over the past 30 years. Unless we do something about that,
                cross-border validation and recognition of qualifications will

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker, I thank Sue Ramsey for bringing
                this matter to the Floor of the House. I am pleased that I have
                been able to attend the debate, and I have listened with
                interest to the points made by Members.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Working towards a common validation and
                recognition of the qualifications of health and social services
                staff on a cross-border basis is an area in which I have a
                particular interest. I recognise that the wide range of
                professionals involved makes this complex. The extent to which
                the development of common validation has been explored varies
                between professional groups.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Ramsey and other Members have pointed out
                that people who qualify in nursing in the South must have their
                qualifications formally recognised by the regulatory body here
                to allow them to work as nurses or midwives here. The same is
                true for people in other professions who qualify in the South
                and who wish to work here. Therefore although a professional
                qualification may be recognised North and South, to be able to
                practise in both jurisdictions, a person must register with both
                regulatory bodies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Hendron said that some groups have taken
                steps to correct this, resulting in the new regulatory body for
                social care staff, the Northern Ireland Social Care Council (NISCC)
                and the Central Council for Education and Training in Social
                Work its predecessor (CCETSW). These bodies have established
                close links with the National Social Work Qualifications Board (NSWQB)
                in the South and have undertaken some joint work, including the
                recent cross-border mobility study. I am keen to see further
                development of initiatives of this kind, as such work is
                extremely important.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some of the existing arrangements inhibit the
                development of flexible cross-border working patterns that would
                offer service benefits North and South. Mr Savage and others
                queried the potential benefits, but they are clearly there.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Centre for Cross Border Studies published
                a report earlier this year on cross-border co-operation in
                health services in Ireland. The report cited the requirement
                that registration and accreditation of nursing, medical and
                allied professions be carried out North and South as a serious
                inhibition to developing joint appointments, staff rotations,
                placements and cross-covering, all of which health professionals
                have been discussing as ways to improve services in their areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report highlighted the fact that
                undergraduate and postgraduate training is organised and
                accredited by different bodies, North and South. It was also
                recognised that, in many cases, reciprocal recognition does not
                exist, and this inhibits partnerships in training programmes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Mr Dallat said, there are other aspects
                far beyond the question of validation or accreditation that must
                be taken into account. In considering the obstacles to mobility,
                the North/South Ministerial Council will consider some of the
                more general questions. The main issue is not just mutual
                recognition, but also differing terms and conditions of service
                and general barriers, not specifically related to health and
                social care.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Savage asked whether the measures that are
                in place, or that we seek to take forward, are discriminatory.
                The underlying rationale of mutual recognition is to remove the
                potential for discriminatory action; it will not favour one
                member state over another.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The North/South Ministerial Council has
                commissioned a study on obstacles to mobility between the two
                parts of the island. I anticipate that similar barriers will be
                identified to those already cited and which individuals have
                encountered when moving, either North to South or vice versa.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Hendron mentioned co-operation. The health
                and social care professionals working in border areas have local
                knowledge of the practical benefits of working together in the
                various fields. They have carried out that work across different
                areas. The recent Altnagelvin/ Letterkenny partnership project,
                for example, detailed 13 constraints to effective cross-border
                partnership. The knowledge and awareness of the various barriers
                and obstacles to cross-border working has come from those who
                have working experience and who seek to improve matters in their
                areas. They are, therefore, well placed to contribute to the
                North/South Ministerial Council’s study of obstacles to
                mobility.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These considerations highlight the complexity
                of the area and the need to be clear about the barriers and how
                they might be overcome. I am keen to see progress on the matter
                and will be exploring the use of the North/South Ministerial
                Council as a vehicle for progressing the issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Morrice and others said that this is a
                question for the island of Ireland. It is also a question in a
                wider European context. I was delighted to jointly open a recent
                conference at which the delegates studied the work in the wider
                context.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have listened carefully to Members’
                contributions and will respond in writing to any issues that I
                have not covered. I welcome this debate; it is key to the
                improvement of border areas. It is vital that people from that
                substantial part of the island get the best out of local
                services. A recent North/South Ministerial Council sectoral
                meeting on health and food safety considered regional and
                supraregional services. I appreciate the attention that the
                Assembly is giving to this important matter.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Ramsey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I
                listened carefully to the Minister and to Members.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is probably one of our easiest debates
                on health matters. As far as I know, it is the first time that
                everyone has agreed a motion. We are moving forward.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several Members mentioned the problems faced
                by the Health Service in general, and I agree with them.
                However, if we make it easier for staff to work on an all-island
                basis we shall fill gaps in provision in the short term. Kieran
                McCarthy said that we should not concentrate solely on the
                border counties. I agree with that, but the primary effect of
                the proposed changes will be on people living in those areas,
                because they live close to hospitals on either side of the
                border.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Jane Morrice and Billy Hutchinson mentioned
                the European market. I agree with what they said, but, at
                present, nursing staff must re-register, which has cost
                implications for the individual. That system should be stopped,
                and registration should be automatic. Several Members, including
                Mr Dallat, said that the issue involved all Departments. We
                should aim at making things easier for professionals working in
                the health sector or in any other sector.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Hendron rightly said that nursing staff
                were the backbone of the Health Service. I also agree with Mr
                Savage, who said that it was not simply an all-Ireland matter
                and that we must examine the matter in a European context.
                However, tall oaks from little acorns grow. The problem of
                foot-and-mouth disease was dealt with successfully by work done
                on an all-Ireland basis. If we start by considering
                qualifications from an all-Ireland perspective we can progress
                to involving the British-Irish Council and Brussels.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for saying that the
                motion covered a range of professionals associated with the
                Health Service. It highlights the problems faced by those
                working at service delivery level. All Members seem to agree
                with the motion, so I hope that it will be passed. We must sort
                out the problems as soon as possible.</p>

                part-time RUC Reserve members in the Police Pension Regulations
                is as follows:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Where a member is medically discharged
                from the force because of an injury received in the execution of
                his duty and sick pay ceases, the RUC (R) Pensions Regulations
                provide for the payment of a pension if the member, as a result
                of his injury (providing such injury is not wholly or mainly due
                to the member’s own serious and culpable negligence or
                misconduct), is permanently disabled from following his own
                employment. The amount of such pension, which includes a lump
                sum payment, depends on the degree of disablement, the rate of
                Police pay on which the calculation is based, the length of RUC
                (Reserve) service and the National Insurance Benefit to which a
                member may be entitled.&quot;</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Part-time RUC Reserve members are liable for
                further national insurance contributions under the Social
                Security Benefit (Northern Ireland) Act 1992 to the maximum
                contribution levels that occasionally apply. There was no
                mention of a pension for part-time members anywhere in RUC
                Regulations. Similarly, no pension provision was made for
                full-time members of the RUC Reserve: rather, a £500 bounty was
                paid on a triennial basis — a not inconsiderable amount in the
                1970s. At the same time, regular RUC officers received no
                bounty, but were still expected to pay a percentage of their pay
                into the pension scheme. Some officers received less take-home
                pay than some of their full-time Reserve colleagues.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It seems strange and, indeed, discriminatory
                that full-time Reserve members were paid a bounty every three
                years while part-time members were not. That bounty was surely a
                payment in place of a pension provision. A judicial review in
                1994 rightly resulted in a pension scheme’s being awarded to
                full-time RUC Reserve officers, backdated to 1988. Again, the
                part-time Reserve was not included in those new arrangements.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall speak about the status of the
                part-time Reserve. Part of the problem is that some people
                regard the part-time Reserve as part-time employees of a
                part-time force. Full-time Reserve officers are full-time
                workers employed under renewable contracts, and the Chief
                Constable regards that section of the force as essential. He has
                praised that part of the full-time force and believes that he
                would have great difficulty meeting policing needs without the
                part-time Reserve. The full-time element of the Reserve is made
                up of full-time workers, and the part-time Reserve is part of
                that. Members are not part-time workers of a part-time force;
                they are part-time workers of a full-time force. There was a
                debate earlier on the rights of part-time workers. This motion
                continues that debate but addresses a specific aspect of it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us briefly look at the work of the
                part-time force. Men and women do their day’s work but assist
                the community and help to maintain security in the evenings and
                at weekends, and their presence frees full-time Reserve and
                regular officers. Surely, we all recognise the important work
                that policing must undertake, particularly in the evenings and
                at weekends. I also remind the Assembly that the part-time
                Reserve remains in situ under the new policing arrangements.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Under the terms of the relevant pension
                legislation, part-time Reserve members were and are in non-pensionable
                employment. Heretofore, that also applied to the full-time RUC
                Reserve. Part-time members could, if they wished, contribute to
                their pension plans, and those contributions were eligible for
                tax relief at the highest rate. All contributions to an approved
                pension scheme are eligible for such relief. If, as in the case
                of the full-time Reserve, a bounty of £500 were paid into a
                pension fund, a gross payment in the region of £700 would have
                followed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At that time of high inflation and of high
                returns from tax-free growth, which were allowed because of the
                legislation that applied to pension contracts, a substantial
                fund could have been established for part-time members. The
                majority of those members have given more than 20 years’
                service to the Northern Ireland community. That should have
                provided a reasonable annuity and, in normal circumstances, a
                lump sum at a reasonable cost to the taxpayer. The police
                pension scheme is one of the best available in the public
                service. It allows for retirement after 30 years’ service,
                with no loss of benefits for retirement before the statutory age
                of 65.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that the Assembly will agree that the
                RUC part-time Reserve has been overlooked for years in respect
                of a bounty payment or a pension. The present Government have
                introduced the stakeholder pension scheme. Part-time members
                have received letters that tell them that they can buy into the
                scheme. However, when they buy in, they receive no Government
                contribution, unlike their full-time colleagues. Others who work
                in security and emergency cover in Northern Ireland, such as the
                Territorial Army and the Royal Irish Regiment — formerly the
                Ulster Defence Regiment — contain part- time elements who
                receive a bounty payment. I ask the Assembly to support the RUC
                part-time officers’ attempts to get what they duly deserve.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Attwood:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to raise some points about the
                entitlements and future recruitment of the Police Service of
                Northern Ireland Reserve. Members have on various occasions
                discussed the entitlements of workers in Northern Ireland. One
                such debate was on the minimum wage, which applies especially to
                those in part-time permanent or temporary contracts. Therefore
                in the context of the entitlements of workers in general, and of
                part-time workers in particular, the Chamber should consider the
                work and employment conditions of PSNI members and of the PSNI
                Reserve.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On hourly rates, holiday entitlement, and
                general pay and conditions, the principle outlined in the motion
                warrants consideration, and, in many people’s opinion,
                support. That principle is, if consistency is to be maintained
                in the Chamber, that all part-time workers should be entitled to
                equal conditions, whether they belong to the PSNI or to any
                other public or private service. Given that that is the
                principle being advanced, the SDLP is sympathetic to Mr Hussey’s
                motion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, Members must be cautious in applying
                that principle. It was interesting that Mr Hussey talked about
                the bounty payment for those in the full-time Reserve, and how
                that could be applied to those in the part-time Reserve. That
                differs from an established pension scheme in which people make
                weekly or monthly payments into a pension fund.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That aside, we should be cautious as to how
                far the principle might apply in respect of pension entitlement
                for members of any organisation who give only a few hours of
                service. Part-time workers might work for only four hours in any
                week. Therefore, the application of a pension principle to those
                who might work for such limited hours needs to be carefully
                thought through.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would also caution that while there may be
                some merit in the motion, and while it may be considered further
                in other places, its principle, and the approach adopted by
                Government and policing organisations to it, should not in any
                way be used to delay or frustrate the new beginning for
                policing. There is concern that delays in resolving the
                negotiations between the representative policing organisations
                and the Government on the severance scheme for members of the
                full-time Reserve might bring about a delay in the new beginning
                for policing. Such delays could be in relation to the phasing
                out of the full-time Reserve or to the recruitment of the new
                PSNI part-time Reserve.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Whatever the entitlement of the full-time or
                part-time Reserve might be, it is important, in order to be
                consistent with the new beginning for policing, and mindful of
                the security situation, that recruitment into the new part-time
                Reserve start quickly. In that recruitment the Patten principle
                that people should be recruited from areas where there are no,
                or few, members of the current part-time Reserve should be
                applied vigorously. It is important that the target of 2,500
                part-time Reserve members over three years, outlined in the
                Patten implementation plan, be achieved in a way that is
                consistent with the new beginning for policing. That will ensure
                that the growing support for the PSNI will begin to develop pace
                in all sections and all communities in the North.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order. I must caution the Member that the
                motion is very clear. It is about the RUC part-time Reserve and
                the pensions of people from that era. It is straying outside the
                realms of the motion to talk about those who may come to be
                members of the PSNI.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Attwood:</p>

                surprised that you have already given me the flexibility that
                you have.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I return to the substance of the motion. It
                is also important — and this is part of the emotional thinking
                as opposed to the political and tactical thinking behind what
                Derek Hussey has outlined — to acknowledge that the part-time
                Reserve, over the years of service within the RUC, and now
                within the PSNI, did fulfil a valuable role. That role was not
                the role of the established RUC; it was to provide community
                support and community service in the North. Contractually and
                practically, that was the role of the part-time Reserve, and
                that role will be valuable in the future in ensuring that the
                core value of policing — community policing — is honoured,
                respected and advanced. In having sympathy with the motion, we
                wish to acknowledge that that was the historic and intended role
                of the part-time Reserve. We also acknowledge that its members
                — like other members of the RUC — far too often, in far too
                many places and in far too many ways, had unjustified and
                illegitimate threat and terror inflicted on them. Immense pain
                was caused to the part-time Reserve, the RUC and their wider
                families. In that context, and for those reasons, the SDLP has
                sympathy with the motion and will not oppose it.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I congratulate Mr Hussey for moving the
                motion. The DUP will wholeheartedly support it, and I hope that
                all Members support it fulsomely and without caveat. It is
                essential that the House should defend the rights of those in
                employment, whether they work in the Health Service, education
                or policing. Public representatives have a duty to do that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that no one will let his anti-RUC bias
                deny members of the RUC Reserve their pension rights. I welcome
                Mr Attwood’s saying that it is appropriate for proper
                employment arrangements to be made for the RUC. It is
                appropriate. He made some justification of it. I do not mind
                what spin he puts on it as long as he and the SDLP support the
                motion. That is progress.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The House must send out the message that RUC
                Reserve pensioners deserve proper recognition and proper pension
                rights. It is essential that the House does what it can to raise
                that issue with the Government, the Chief Constable and those
                people who take the decisions that deny members of the RUC
                Reserve their proper pension rights.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hussey mentioned the vital role played by
                part- time members of the RUC. That can be seen from the rolls
                of honour in police stations and other public buildings that
                show the ultimate sacrifice that those people made, even though
                they were part-time members of the police force.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Attwood said that the RUC Reserve did play
                a vital role. I hope that &quot;did&quot; is not the operative
                word and that the Reserve continues to play a vital role because
                it remains part of policing here.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was interested in the operational manpower
                figures for Northern Ireland in Her Majesty’s Inspector of
                Constabulary’s report. They should be a wake-up call for
                Members interested in effective policing. Members of the
                Northern Ireland Policing Board should accept that if they want
                more beat officers in rural and urban areas, full-time and
                part-time members of the Reserve play a vital part in everyday
                policing here.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Look at the statistics. In Mr Attwood’s
                constituency, West Belfast, 43% of all police officers on the
                beat are members of the full-time and part-time Reserve. In
                areas west of the Bann, an average of one in three officers is
                in the full-time or part-time Reserve. In North Antrim, 25% of
                officers on operational duty are in the full-time or part-time
                Reserve. In other areas the figures are over 40%. People should
                realise that the vital role played by those members must be
                recognised by an adequate salary and pension and, as Mr Hussey
                pointed out, by a bounty such as is made available to others who
                work for the defence of this country.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The policing demands of Northern Ireland
                cannot do without the level of manpower that the full-time and
                part-time Reserve provide. With that important issue in mind, it
                is essential that we support the motion. Some people are in
                danger of sacrificing good and effective policing on the altar
                of Patten, as if he were a god.</p>

                for the gander. The motion does not refer to upcoming officers
                in a new and developing service, but to the right of the
                part-time RUC Reserve to receive proper pension entitlement. The
                motion refers to part-time, not full-time, staff, and to past,
                rather than future, service. I draw that to the Member’s
                attention as I drew it to the attention of Mr Attwood earlier.</p>

                off and reprimanded. Nonetheless, I am glad to have put those
                issues on the record.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with Mr Hussey that many members of
                the RUC Reserve have been overlooked with regard to pensions or
                bounties. However, I will go further and say that they have been
                treated with contempt when it comes to their pension rights.
                They are being turned into a political sacrifice, and they are
                paying the price, because they are losing their pension rights.
                Northern Ireland is also paying a price, because it will lose
                out on the service and the level of effectiveness that we can
                expect from the police in the future. I hope that all sides of
                the House will have the courage of their convictions. If Members
                support employment and pension rights for other people under
                other circumstances, I hope that they will support those rights
                for members of the RUC Reserve.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion, which is very
                appropriate at the moment. I have a little problem with the new
                initials — PSNI — especially after your chastisement of my
                Colleagues, Mr Speaker, for introducing what you saw as a
                subject that was not relevant to the motion. Nonetheless, it is
                important that people like me, who have never had any initials
                to use other than &quot;RUC&quot;, get into the habit of using
                &quot;PSNI&quot; and become familiar with the term. Mention of
                the PSNI is relevant because if the treatment of the former RUC
                Reserve members is unjust and ungenerous, that will have an
                effect on the future recruitment of a very necessary part of the
                policing service of the country.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I know well from my own many years of service
                in the police that there are many occasions of public importance
                — from motor racing events to political gatherings and other
                large public occasions — which it would be absurd to man with
                expensive, professional, highly trained people. What is needed
                is bodies on the ground who are well trained for the functions
                that they are being asked to perform and who are available at
                short notice.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we forget about the service of the
                part-time RUC Reserve, we will find their replacements hard to
                recruit. We spoke to the Police Federation, which represents all
                ranks of the police on such matters, and we were given some
                technical advice about the complications that could happen if
                identical pension schemes were to be introduced for regular and
                reserve police. We concluded that it was proper to examine each
                police reservist’s service individually. An honorarium system
                would take due account of the service given by individual men
                and women and enable them to make pension provision if they so
                wished. I have discussed this with Mr Hussey, who concurs, and I
                am happy, therefore, once again, to practise saying the initials
                &quot;PSNI&quot;, and to support the motion.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hussey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome Members’ contributions. I thank
                Mr Attwood for his support of the principle and his
                acknowledgement of the excellent input of officers to the
                community over 30 years and of the pain — and worse — that
                they have suffered. I thank Mr Paisley for his expansion of my
                explanation of the vital role of the reserve element in policing
                in Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker, I thank you for your intervention
                and reminder that the debate is on the RUC part-time Reserve.
                However, the point was also made that that element continues
                through. Sir John Gorman took that line. His contribution was
                one of the most telling. He said that the way we treat officers
                who have served in the RUC part- time Reserve will impact on
                people’s attitude to joining the new PSNI. His idea of an
                honorarium has opened the debate up a little, but policing is a
                reserved matter. We may have some impact if those responsible
                read the Hansard report of the debate. I sincerely urge them to
                consider carefully the matters we have raised. I urge support
                for the motion.</p>
