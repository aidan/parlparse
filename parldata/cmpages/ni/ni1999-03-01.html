                </font></b><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">By virtue of paragraph&nbsp;1 of the schedule
                to the Northern&nbsp;Ireland (Elections) Act 1998, it falls to
                the Secretary of State to determine where meetings of the
                Assembly shall be held and when. I have received a letter to the
                Assembly from the Secretary of State directing that the Assembly
                shall meet at Parliament&nbsp;Buildings, Stormont at
                10.30&nbsp;am on Monday 1&nbsp;March until 6.00&nbsp;pm on
                Tuesday 9&nbsp;March 1999.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Secretary of State has also indicated
                that she will consider a further direction as respects this
                period, in particular in the light of any indications she may
                receive as to the wishes of the Assembly after it has begun to
                meet.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the last sitting, as recorded on
                page&nbsp;120 of Volume&nbsp;2 of Hansard, Mr&nbsp;Dodds raised
                a question as to whether remarks about the Orange Order and the
                RUC made by Mr&nbsp;Mitchel&nbsp;McLaughlin at the sitting on
                16&nbsp;February&nbsp;1999, recorded on page&nbsp;105 of
                Volume&nbsp;2 of Hansard, were unparliamentary. At the time I
                said that, however objectionable Mr&nbsp;Dodds or others might
                have found the remarks, I did not believe them to be
                unparliamentary or a breach of privilege. Having examined the
                matter further, I am still of that view.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr&nbsp;Initial
                Presiding Officer. The business of today’s sitting was
                originally trailed as being the presentation of the report from
                the Standing Orders Committee. I understand that the Committee
                is within sight of the finishing line and that its report will
                come later. However, I understand that the Committee’s work
                was further disrupted at its last meeting by the behaviour of
                Sinn&nbsp;Féin/IRA members who questioned the integrity of the
                SDLP joint Chairman. Subsequently the meeting had to be
                adjourned.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Are you satisfied that the Chairmen of the
                House’s Committees have sufficient powers to deal with this
                kind of disruptive behaviour? Should those who cause such
                disruption not be ejected from the meeting, rather than the
                meeting itself being stopped?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Initial Presiding Officer:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I understand that the meeting to which you
                refer took place on Friday afternoon. I have not received any
                report of it save what you have said, Mr&nbsp;Robinson, although
                this morning I have been engaged in making preparations for
                today’s sitting. Obviously, if any such matter were to be
                brought to my attention by the joint Chairmen of the Standing
                Orders Committee I would be content to look into it. That is a
                matter for them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If there are any other matters in regard to
                that which I should deal with, I will do my best to do so.
                However, it seems to me that this is essentially a Standing
                Orders matter, and if the Standing Orders Committee is unable to
                address the matter of Standing Orders for Committees, things are
                in poor shape.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I look forward to receiving a report of what
                happened at the meeting.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr C Wilson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Initial Presiding Officer, as you are
                aware, last week I lodged with your office a complaint about the
                presence in this Building of a large number of delegates from
                the Irish Republic. I believe that they were senior civil
                servants. This matter was of concern to many Assembly Members.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Apparently the delegates were allocated a
                number of rooms and were free to roam around. They appeared from
                every doorway — it was almost an infestation of Dublin civil
                servants. I would like you to tell us under what authority —</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Farren:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Initial Presiding
                Officer.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Initial Presiding Officer:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is not permissible to intervene with a
                point of order during a point of order, but you may make your
                point after this.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr C Wilson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This matter was of concern not only to my
                party but also to many others who wondered on what basis these
                people had gained access to the building and under whose
                authority the rooms had been allocated. I believe that protocol
                dictates that proposals for official visits from other bodies
                should, at the very least, be brought before the Shadow
                Commission or the Committee to Advise the Presiding Officer. I
                do not think that any party knew that these people were going to
                be here. The Assembly should be notified of any visits by people
                from a foreign state. Members should also be given information
                on the proper procedures to be followed in the event of any
                future visits of this nature.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Initial Presiding Officer:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are three matters relating to this
                issue. The first is a political one, and it is not for me to
                comment on, save to say that I think it would be best if all our
                comments, political or otherwise, were made in the most
                courteous way.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second matter concerns the arrangements
                for the allocation of rooms. I remind Members that we are not
                legally in possession of this Building. Until the appointed day
                the Building will remain the property of Her&nbsp;Majesty’s
                Government. The Secretary of State or Ministers acting on her
                behalf occasionally request the use of offices or other
                facilities here. In fact, these are rather more than requests,
                as ownership still rests with the Government. Offices must be
                made available in response to requests from the Secretary of
                State or her Ministers. The Building is the property of the
                Government, and such requests do not come through the process
                that applies to other applications. This request was made in the
                way that I have described.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The third issue is to do with security and
                whether people are adhering to the regulations that have been
                established. Following the Member’s complaint, I asked for a
                report from the Keeper of the House. Having received a written
                report, I met with that official. I have asked for further
                enquiries to be made, and I hope to have meetings later today to
                address the matters so that everyone may be clear on how the
                security of all those who come into the Building can best be
                ensured.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Farren:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Initial Presiding Officer, thank you for
                your clarification about the authority under which the civil
                servants from Dublin were present in these premises over the
                last week. I wish to express a very strong objection to language
                used by Mr&nbsp;Cedric&nbsp;Wilson of a party whose name escapes
                me for the moment. To describe servants of the Southern state as
                infesting this Building is very objectionable, and I wish my
                objection to be recorded.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Initial Presiding Officer:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I understand your objection. I think I
                indicated earlier that such points are essentially political
                matters rather than matters of order. That does not mean that
                they cannot be made, of course.</p>

                public relations and political and Assembly advice and

                declaring of clients, the services which require such

                Parliament Buildings, making representations to Ministers, civil
                servants and other Members, accompanying delegations to

                debates in the Assembly, include debates in Committees, the
                presentation of a public petition, and meetings of Committees at
                which evidence is heard. On all such occasions the Member will
                declare his or her interest at the beginning of his or her
                remarks. It will be a matter for the Member’s judgement, if
                the interest is already recorded in the Register, whether he or
                she simply draws attention to this or makes a rather fuller
                disclosure. Declarations of interest made in Committees shall be

                bands of £5,000, shall be deposited with the Clerk of Standards
                at the same time as it is registered in the Register of Members’
                interests and made available for inspection by the public.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unfortunately I have to begin with an
                apology. My voice is not in its usual working order because of a
                bad dose of the cold. I hope that Members will be able to make
                out what I am saying.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let me at the outset refer to the comments of
                Mr&nbsp;Robinson about the last meeting of the Committee on
                Standing Orders. I am very moved indeed by the Member’s
                concern for my safety and welfare. The Committee has worked very
                well for the last nine months. I cannot recall a single cross
                word or a single vote at any other meeting.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee has almost completed its work
                — owing to the energies of Mr&nbsp;Cobain and myself, with a
                remarkable degree of consensus, I think. I regret the minor
                squall which shivered our timbers on Friday afternoon, but I
                fancy that I steered the ship safely into port without any glass
                being broken. <i>[Interruption]</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will find out later what the remark was.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Members are well aware, the Committee is
                working very energetically to compile a set of workable Standing
                Orders. It is with some regret that it is not able to bring a
                full report to the Assembly today. However, all good things come
                to those who wait.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Having created an air of anticipation, I have
                a duty to put before the Assembly a matter which I think cannot
                wait until the Committee has completed its task. The Assembly
                has been in operation for approximately nine months, albeit in
                shadow form. I suppose one could say that it is time for us to
                make a delivery of some kind. Last week we heard from a quintet
                of quantity surveyors, when the Assembly was asked to adopt the
                Commission’s report. This week, it is the medics.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Last Monday some Members may have initially
                — I emphasise the word &quot;initially&quot; — been
                surprised at the projected increase in the operating costs of
                the &quot;New Assembly plc&quot;. The reasons for this were soon
                made clear, but the media saw it as a controversial issue. I
                trust that today the media will note that the Assembly is, I
                hope, going to christen a bouncing baby Prudence. This is about
                self-regulation, about setting up an infant system of
                registration and the monitoring of Members’ interests.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee on Standing Orders has
                considered this issue and has come up against some problems.
                There are a number of imponderables. Will there, as elsewhere,
                be an Assembly Commissioner to look after standards? We do not
                yet know. If there is no Commissioner, what alternative
                arrangements will be made? We do not know that either. If there
                is to be a Commissioner, how will he be appointed? What exactly
                will he do? We do not know the answers to any of these
                questions. The enquiries that have been made through the Office
                of the Initial Presiding Officer have not yet yielded any clear
                information.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We therefore consider it unwise to continue
                to wait for such answers, and, through this motion, we are
                proposing a temporary arrangement based on minor adaptations to
                the Code and Guide to Members’ Interests at Westminster — a
                document which will be familiar to those who are also Members of
                that House.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proposed arrangement is an interim one
                which will provide the quickest means of establishing a form of
                regulation pending the setting up of more permanent and more
                carefully considered arrangements.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">10.45 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We propose — as Dr&nbsp;Paisley suggested
                last week, albeit for other reasons — that a Committee on
                Standards and Privileges be set up. This Committee would be a
                Standing Committee of the House, standing not in the Westminster
                sense, but in the true sense of its being a permanent Committee
                of the House. The issue of Members’ interests is much too
                serious and wide-ranging an issue to rest with the Committee on
                Standing Orders.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We recommend that the policy functions
                associated with this be passed to the new Committee, and we seek
                the Assembly’s approval, in principle, for its establishment.
                Our detailed proposals on Committees generally are contained in
                the draft Standing Orders, but because they are far-reaching, we
                ask Members to be patient and await their exact delineation,
                probably next week. If the Assembly chooses to approve this
                interim arrangement, it is our view that the matter of Members’
                interests, including the interim issues, should be taken forward
                by the proposed new Committee.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The purpose of action on Members’ interests
                is to assist Members in the discharge of their obligations to
                the Assembly, to their constituents and to the general public.
                Members have a duty to uphold the law and to act in accordance
                with the trust placed in them. Holders of public office should
                promote and support, by their leadership and example, the
                principles of selflessness, integrity, objectivity,
                accountability, openness and honesty. In essence, this
                translates to the following:</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members should base their conduct on a
                consideration of the public interest, avoid conflict between
                personal interest and the public interest and resolve any
                conflict between the two in favour of the latter. We should at
                all times conduct ourselves in a manner which maintains and
                strengthens the public’s trust and confidence in the integrity
                of the Assembly and never undertake any action which would bring
                the Assembly or its Members into disrepute.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The acceptance by any Member of a bribe to
                influence his or her conduct, including any fee, compensation or
                reward in connection with the promotion of, or opposition to,
                any Bill, motion or other matter submitted or intended to be
                submitted to the Assembly or to any Committee, is unlawful and
                entirely unacceptable.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is proposed, as part of this package, that
                a Register of Members’ interests be established. This would be
                under the control of a Clerk of Standards who would also act as
                Clerk to the proposed new Committee that we wish to see
                established as soon as practicable. Members can see from the
                papers the range and extent of the proposed register.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will not spend time repeating or explaining
                what is before the House. The Guide itself is sufficient. We
                should fulfil conscientiously the requirements of the Assembly
                in respect of the registration of interests in the register. <i>[Interruption]</p>

                number of Members who are having lengthy conversations, and this

                Committees or in any communications with Ministers, Departments
                or executive agencies. In any activity with or on behalf of an
                organisation with which a Member has a financial arrangement,
                including activities which may not be a matter of public record,
                such as informal meetings and functions, he or she must always
                bear in mind the need to be open, and honest with Ministers,
                Members and officials.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No Member should act as a paid advocate in
                any proceedings of the Assembly. No improper use should be made
                of any payment or allowance made to Members for public purposes,
                and the rules which apply to such payments must be strictly
                observed. Members must bear in mind that the information which
                they receive in confidence in the course of their Assembly
                duties should be used only in connection with those duties and
                that such information must never be used for the purpose of
                personal or financial gain.</p>

                Order on this matter, we must be seen to be completely open and
                honest in our dealings, and that should be characterised today
                by a readiness on the part of the Assembly — a readiness that
                we saw last week when it embraced the Commission’s report —

                that you did not call him to order. I thought that as you had
                not ruled on that matter, I was perfectly within my rights in
                referring to it.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.00 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given that I do not anticipate an abundance
                of Members who wish to speak today on this issue, I am a little
                surprised at how assiduous you are in calling me to order on
                this point.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Coming back to the main point, I do hope that
                the Committee on Standing Orders will be able to finish its work
                in the constructive way in which it has operated throughout. It
                is unfortunate that that incident occurred on Friday.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to deal with a couple of points that
                the Chairman went into in some detail. It is a sign of the times
                that we are bringing this type of motion to the Assembly.
                Fifteen or 20 years ago this would not have been one of the
                first priorities of any elected body, but it is right and proper
                that one of the first duties of the Assembly should be to
                implement this report and set up a Committee on Standards and
                Privileges. That is no less than all Members should now expect,
                and, indeed, members of the public and the press expect it. We
                should be open and transparent in our work; people should know
                exactly what our interests are; and this motion should therefore
                command the unanimous support of all Members.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The recommendation to set up a Committee on
                Standards and Privileges is very welcome. Such Committees have
                operated well in the House of Commons and elsewhere.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to draw attention to one point: this
                report does not specifically recommend or deal with an Assembly
                Commissioner on Standards and Privileges. That will be dealt
                with by the Committee on Standards and Privileges, but my view,
                and the view of my party, is that such a person should be an
                appointed official of the House whose duties would be to monitor
                how the rules were being applied, to draw to the attention of
                the Committee and the House any breaches or difficulties that
                were foreseen or were occurring with the operation of the
                various rules and to investigate complaints made by Members or
                by members of the public.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important that these issues do not
                become party political and that we do not have members of
                Committees from any one particular party carrying out
                investigations, whether that be the Chairmen or the members of
                those Committees. Investigations should be carried out by
                someone who is answerable to an entire Committee and is an
                official of the House.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The idea of having an Assembly Commissioner
                on Standards and Privileges who was an official to look after
                this area, to monitor, to draw attention to and to investigate
                is a good one and something that the Committee, when it is set
                up, will arrange quickly, and I anticipate that this Committee
                will be set up very soon.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When we debated this in the Standing Orders
                Committee there was some initial thought that we should just
                have a general, wide-ranging motion, leaving it to Members to
                register interests that might be perceived as interests that
                they should register. However, several members of the Standing
                Orders Committee believe that we need to be more specific, and
                more certain, because there is nothing worse in this area than
                uncertainty and vagueness. Members need to know where they
                stand, and what interests need to be registered. Likewise, the
                public should know exactly what should be registered and
                declared as an interest.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was also made clear that the Committee,
                when it is set up, should have the power, specifically, and the
                Chairman drew attention to this, to tweak the rules and change
                them if necessary as we proceed so that they are what the
                Assembly requires and what the people of Northern&nbsp;Ireland
                deserve and require.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These rules are not set in concrete. They are
                very full and follow very closely what is in operation in the
                United&nbsp;Kingdom and what is going to be in place for the
                National Assembly of Wales. They can be changed as we go along,
                and any changes will be brought to the House, to enable them to
                reflect the particular needs of this Assembly and the people of
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I warmly welcome this report and hope that it
                will have full support from all sections of the House.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr ONeill:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although I am not a regular member of the
                Standing Orders Committee, I frequently attend its meetings as a
                substitute for my party. I should like to place on record my
                appreciation of the Committee’s hard work and, in particular,
                the work of the joint Chairmen, both of whom have put in a great
                deal of effort. It would not be beyond the bounds of acceptable
                comment to mention Denis&nbsp;Haughey in that regard. His work
                as a Chairman has been exemplary and visionary, and has helped
                to guide the Committee through many rough patches. It is very
                disturbing when his character is impugned in a meeting, as
                happened on Friday, and I strongly object to that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important to begin at the beginning
                when debating the motion. As Mr&nbsp;Dodds said, there was a
                time when this topic would not have come up for discussion. It
                is important to recall the need to introduce a method of
                self-regulation for Members of an elected Assembly. The origin
                lies in the spate of allegations in Britain in the early 1990s
                which, when taken together, persuaded many people that standards
                in public life were falling and that an atmosphere of sleaze had
                taken hold.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The allegations included cash for questions;
                the employment of ex-Ministers and former officials by firms
                that they had privatised; links between political donations and
                appointments and honours; and fraud and corruption in local
                government and in quangos. All of that will be familiar to
                Members. Public concern on all those matters led the Prime
                Minister of the day to set up the Nolan Committee in 1994 to
                inquire into standards in public life. Although Neill has
                replaced Nolan, the Committee is expected to continue
                indefinitely. Perhaps that is good. I hope that our Committee,
                when it is formed, will continue, as Mr&nbsp;Dodds said,
                tweaking and improving the rules as it goes along.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most of Nolan’s findings were adopted or
                added to by the Select Committee on Standards and Privileges.
                Those same standards are reflected in the important report that
                is before the House. Historically, many of the people that we
                represent have a jaundiced view of democracy. Some have had
                little trust in it and have adopted other means to get their
                views across.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is incumbent on the Assembly to ensure
                that the unique form of democracy that we are attempting to
                build is not only above reproach but is seen to be above
                reproach. That is essential not just on moral grounds, which of
                course it should be, but also because it is necessary for us to
                demonstrate that Members and the systems that we are creating
                can be trusted. That is why the report is so significant.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The requirements for Members to register
                their interests are open, clear, comprehensive and
                straightforward. They cover all the main areas that might be
                considered vulnerable to abuse. They also clearly set down the
                limits and procedures both for Members and for the public. In
                that regard the procedure for the declaration of Members’
                interests is so laid out as to cover almost every possible
                situation, whether in Assembly debates, written notices,
                Adjournment or emergency debates, or anything else.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The advocacy rule is also of great
                importance, and it deals well with both the initiation of
                proceedings and participation in a debate in which the Member
                has a financial interest. In particular, the section deals well
                with a difference of opinion that arose between Nolan and the
                Select Committee on the types of bodies with which Members
                should be allowed to have a paid relationship. Members will
                recall that the Committee concentrated on actions that might be
                open to abuse or suspicion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They therefore distinguished between paid
                advice, which was permitted, and paid advocacy, which was
                prohibited. Nolan had rejected this as unenforceable, and there
                is little doubt that he was right. Financial relationships of
                this kind have the potential to corrupt by influencing
                decisions. I welcome the fact that the report’s proposals
                cover all financial interests. There are some issues on which I
                should like some clarity because I was not present when some of
                them were discussed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Category 2 on page 5 lists exceptions from
                some representative roles on various bodies. Now that district
                councillors are being salaried, should not district council
                payments be included in that section along with the others? If
                there is a reason for not doing that, it should be made clear.
                Is everyone satisfied that the Committee on Standards and
                Privileges can provide the Assembly with rules for the necessary
                level of control? Will the role of the Clerk of Standards, which
                is outlined in paragraph 66, be the same or similar to that of
                the Independent Commissioner at Westminster?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with the line in paragraph h of
                Annex&nbsp;A which states that a Member’s duty is</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;to his or her constituents and to
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland as a whole, rather than to any particular
                section thereof &quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The duty that that places on a Member in
                terms of responsibility is stated in paragraph&nbsp;63. Should a
                complaint be made, is it sufficient merely to include the
                provision in paragraph&nbsp;66 which will</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;expect the complainant to assemble
                supporting evidence&quot;?</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That will sometimes be difficult for a
                Member, never mind members of the public. One must have the
                discretion to dismiss frivolous or malicious complaints, but
                perhaps there is a need to allow some greater opportunity to
                seek out information. In Westminster, there have been many
                examples of personal papers, bank and credit card statements
                being examined by the Commissioner.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the penalties to be imposed on an errant
                Member be the same as in Westminster where public censure,
                apology, suspension and eventual expulsion are imposed? If so,
                how will they be operated here? Perhaps the Committee could
                explore that in the future. It could also explore a Member’s
                right to appeal, and what procedure might be put in place to
                allow that. We should offer Members that opportunity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On personal conduct and integrity, the report
                states</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Holders of public office should not
                place themselves under any financial or other obligation to
                outside individuals or organisations that might influence them
                in the performance of their official duties.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is a worthy requirement. Over the
                weekend, there has been much concern in my area about the fact
                that a convicted murderer, and self-confessed and brutal
                murderer to boot, has continued his membership of the
                Orange&nbsp;Order. That this should be allowed to continue is a
                matter of great concern, but the question that came to my mind
                was what influence such an organisation might have on a body
                such as this if that kind of standard were allowed to continue.</p>

                the Ulster Resistance and the DUP to talk about disruption in

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Initial Presiding Officer, I would like
                some clarification from you on Committees, on the Register of
                Members’ interests and on the fact that people are coming out
                of Committees and talking about their business outside before
                matters are brought to the House. Here we have Members who were
                not at the Standing Orders Committee yet seem to be aware of
                what happened there, or rather are not aware of what actually
                happened — that would be my line. I cannot understand how the
                issue of disruption has arisen. I was at the meeting, and I did
                not see any real disruption. If every time questions were asked
                or there was cross-questioning or discussion, the Initial
                Presiding Officer vacated the Chair, the Chair would be empty
                quite often. We need to look further at this issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issue in question is the recognition of
                the Irish language. Members should be allowed to speak it freely
                in the Chamber. That is Sinn&nbsp;Féin’s position, and people
                have a right to debate that and other matters in Committees. The
                purpose of Committees is to enable there to be discussion on
                issues before they come to the Chamber. I saw no problems at all
                with the discussion that took place on Friday.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Initial Presiding
                Officer. The week before last the Committee meeting was
                adjourned at 3.45&nbsp;pm, whereas last week it was 5.00&nbsp;pm
                before it was adjourned. So other interests may have been
                involved apart from what was going on in the meeting itself.</p>

                rather unusual. It would be difficult for me to take a point of
                order from you now. However, since the Member was in the throes
                of his speech, I am not sure that it was necessary for him to
                call the matter a point of order and I will therefore permit you

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have from a very early stage made it clear
                that a translation is a courtesy to other Members; it is not to
                clarify the position for me. I have taken the precaution of
                making arrangements for myself so that I can know if a
                translation that is proffered is a reasonably accurate
                translation of what was said. However, I have always taken the
                view — and this is one that I have expressed to the Assembly
                and which Members have never challenged — that when Members
                speak in another language they should give a translation out of
                courtesy to the other Members.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I cannot say whether Mr&nbsp;Molloy
                understood or not, but it is absolutely clear that many other
                Members did not. I therefore ask Ms&nbsp;Rodgers to translate.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Ms&nbsp;Rodgers for her intervention
                and I am pleased to hear that this has been her first time to
                speak in her native tongue in this Chamber. This is an important
                matter to discuss. I am not an Irish language speaker and I
                openly admit and regret that. That does not mean that I do not
                recognise the right of people to speak it. I want to see it put
                quite clearly on the record and on Standing Orders that people
                do have the right to speak the Irish language — not a language
                of their choice but the Irish language.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Initial Presiding Officer:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have been trying for some time to define
                for myself quite how the right to speak the Irish language comes
                into registrable interests. It is not entirely impossible that
                it would, but it is taking increasing ingenuity to find out how
                it might. I should be grateful if Members would return to the
                motion on the registration of Members’ interest and the Code
                of Conduct.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Molloy:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As you said at the last meeting of the
                Assembly, Mr&nbsp;Initial Presiding Officer, one question begs
                an answer. Nearly every Member who has spoken has referred to
                the Standing Orders Committee on Friday. It is only right that
                I, as a member of the Standing Orders Committee, also refer to
                it. However, I do welcome the interventions, which have been
                worthwhile. It is not simply a matter of choice — it is a
                matter of putting on record in the Standing Orders. That is what
                we are supposed to be debating.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important to support this report. It is
                a temporary measure. Until Standing Orders and the Committee for
                Standards and Privileges start to deal with the issue of members’
                interests and have in place a register of those interests, it is
                important that we set in place some categorisation of standards.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important that the financial interests
                of Members are recorded as well as their non-pecuniary
                interests, but it is more important that we have recognition in
                the register of Members’ interests in secret organisations. I
                refer, in particular, to the Loyal Orders, the Freemasons and
                other related organisations. This would ensure that we know
                where Members are coming from, and that, when Members speak on a
                particular issue, we know which organisation they support.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dallat:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the report and want to express my
                thanks to the Members of the different political parties who
                have worked so hard to produce it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I note that the register will include not
                only pecuniary interests but also non-pecuniary interests. That
                is fundamental. It is very important because much of the past
                mistrust has been based on the belief that power was often
                exercised outside the democratic institutions in a way that
                served no one well in the long term.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am delighted that this proposal comes
                before the Assembly on the same day that new legislation aimed
                at preventing religious discrimination in the provision of a
                wide range of goods and services also becomes law. I am
                convinced that there is a genuine desire on the part of the
                Government to chart a new beginning, free from the mistrust of
                the past.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given the opportunity and the goodwill of all
                parties, I am convinced that the fears of the past can be laid
                to rest. Everyone, irrespective of class or creed, can, with
                confidence, take their rightful place in society, apply for
                jobs, seek goods or services and know that discrimination will
                play no part in the decision-making process.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To make this work, it is essential Members
                complete the register, declaring all outside interests, so that
                no allegations can be made that Members used their position in
                public life to influence decisions outside the House.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People have a right to belong to any
                organisation provided that it is not illegal and that includes
                semi-secret or oath-taking societies. However, I am convinced
                that they should openly declare their membership of these
                organisations so that there can be no confusion in the minds of
                the public when it comes to making decisions on behalf of the
                electorate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Northern Ireland there has been a tendency
                to believe that real power has often been in the hands of people
                who, while operating quite legally, are very restrictive in who
                belongs to their organisations. It would be unfortunate if
                people continued to believe that the power to influence
                decisions remained anywhere but in this House.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The public must begin to place their
                confidence in the ability of the Assembly to make decisions on
                their behalf, which are influenced by nothing but the common
                good of everyone, irrespective of who they are or where they
                come from.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am convinced that there is an enormous
                amount of goodwill for this new Assembly and that the majority
                of the people in the whole community share that goodwill.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am further convinced that as we learn to
                work with and trust each other, confidence will grow and, in
                time, the Assembly can become a model for the rest of the
                democratic world. Many people will look for signs that no
                external interests are capable of influencing the way we do our
                work. I belong to no such organisations and have to respect the
                rights of others who do, but they should record their membership
                of all organisations, including those that demand an oath of
                secrecy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, while it is not yet our
                responsibility, I hope that the Code of Conduct, with which I
                strongly agree, can be adapted to meet the needs of district
                councils. My Colleague Mr&nbsp;ONeill spoke about that. Only by
                adopting and enforcing the highest standards of public
                integrity, can we advance the cause of democracy.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr S Wilson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was out of my seat and had to move back to
                my natural home. I was not thinking of joining the Ulster
                Unionist Party. I had not intended to speak, but after listening
                to some of the comments I feel that it is worth noting a few
                points about the Code of Conduct.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As some Members have said, we do not wish the
                House to get the same reputation as the Dáil in the Irish
                Republic or the reputation that some elements of Westminster
                have obtained for the Mother of Parliaments. There have been
                allegations of sleaze and backhanders, and of people having
                their overdrafts cleared or ignored by the banks. It is
                important to ensure a Code of Conduct that will protect the
                Assembly and its Members from such allegations. The problem is
                that when one Member is tainted by allegations we all tend to
                get tainted.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Code of Conduct is important. As my
                Colleague Nigel&nbsp;Dodds has said, the rules are extremely
                tight so as to cover every eventuality. If new eventualities
                arise, the Standing Orders Committee will be able to tighten the
                rules even further. The integrity of the Assembly is important.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There was a late intervention by Sinn&nbsp;Féin.
                Mr&nbsp;Molloy spent most of his time defending his behaviour
                and that of other members of his party at Friday’s meeting of
                the Standing Orders Committee. He said little about the report
                but, of course, that does not surprise me because Sinn&nbsp;Féin
                members must have choked when they read the first page. They may
                not have got past the first page, or the first paragraph of the
                first page.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The section that is headed &quot;Public
                duty&quot; deals with the public duty of Members. We should not
                forget that opposite us is a party which includes people who
                have been convicted of bombing, murder, blackmail, kidnapping
                and extortion. What is the first public duty of a Member of the

                the law places an obligation on all Members to accept and abide
                by the legally binding determinations of a statutory body which
                has authority, placed on it by Parliament, to make such
                determinations? Does the Member agree that it is therefore the
                duty of Members to accept such determinations? I am referring,

                thought with him. We may find that there are some other
                expulsions from the Assembly before long.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I had not intended to speak in this debate
                but I was provoked by other Members’ contributions. The Code
                of Conduct represents an important step towards ensuring that
                the Assembly is not afflicted by the same sleaze and corruption
                which can be found in another Parliament on this island. I trust
                that Members will adhere to the Code and that it will be
                rigorously enforced to ensure that this House is not brought
                into disrepute.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On behalf of the Alliance Party, I welcome
                the Code of Conduct and support the motion. In view of the fact
                that the guidelines which we will be adopting are very similar
                to those to be adopted by the Welsh Assembly, it is very
                appropriate that we are discussing this matter on St&nbsp;David’s
                Day.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The importance of this report is that it will
                safeguard Members’ interests. It is important that the highest
                standards of honesty and integrity are upheld by those elected
                to serve the community. Obviously there will be temptations, and
                politicians’ reputations will be at stake. It only takes the
                actions of one person, or of a small number of people, to
                tarnish the reputations of all politicians. That is why it is
                important that the requisite standards are set out in this
                document. We have only to look at the situation in the Republic
                of Ireland, where the reputations of a number of politicians
                have been tarnished by their activities in recent years. I was
                listening to the radio yesterday, and I heard that one of the
                biggest-selling records in the Republic at the moment is called
                ‘The Little Brown Envelope’, which takes a swipe at
                politicians. Is it purely coincidental that it is Mr&nbsp;Haughey
                whose name is on the motion before the House today?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The public needs to be able to have
                confidence in politicians. We have been elected to serve the
                public interest, not self-interest, and the public is entitled
                to expect full accountability from its elected representatives.
                Last week, the ‘Belfast&nbsp;Telegraph’ published the lists
                of the interests of our representatives at Westminster. This
                made very useful reading. However, I feel that, as well as
                including details of any remunerative posts, lists of Members’
                interests should include details of non-pecuniary interests. I
                agree with Mr&nbsp;Molloy’s comments about the need to include
                in the register of interests membership of any organisation, be
                it the Masons, the Orange Order, the Knights of Saint Columbanus
                or the Knights of Malta. Membership of all these organisations
                should be included.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The main point of my intervention is to state
                clearly the Alliance Party’s support for this document and to
                express the hope that it will be accepted unanimously.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion and would like to
                commend the work that has already been done by the Committee.
                Sammy&nbsp;Wilson has already raised a very important point in
                relation to the extent to which Members of the Assembly and,
                indeed, the wider public in Northern&nbsp;Ireland can have
                confidence in this document. He pointed out that the Code states</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Members have a duty to uphold the
                law&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">His comments about some of those who are
                inextricably linked to paramilitary groups are very serious. One
                could accuse Members from this side of the House of being
                churlish, of looking back at the past and talking of other
                people’s misdemeanours. However, rather fortuitously and
                amazingly, page&nbsp;1 of the Code of Conduct requiring Members
                to uphold the law reflects page&nbsp;1 of the Belfast Agreement
                — the Bible for the Members opposite, including Sinn&nbsp;Féin.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Under the heading &quot;Declaration of
                Support&quot; on page&nbsp;1 another commitment is required:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;We reaffirm our total and absolute
                commitment to exclusively democratic and peaceful means of
                resolving differences on political issues, and our opposition to
                any use or threat of force by others for any political purpose,
                whether in regard to this agreement or otherwise.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As reflected in the document today, it is a
                requirement for Members of the Assembly to support fully the
                democratic process and the structures for law and order in the
                Province. Someone commented recently that that is also a
                requirement for those taking their seats on the 26&nbsp;councils
                across Northern&nbsp;Ireland. The Sinn Féin members and those
                fronting other paramilitary groups cross their fingers and make
                pledges about their support for the democratic process and the
                Crown forces, but they do not mean a word of it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One has to question whether this document
                means much when people find it difficult to get past the first

                Presiding Officer. You are allowing Members to continue to make
                general remarks about people. I am a Belfast city councillor and
                a Member of the Assembly. I take seriously the pledges that I
                make. I am not sure if other Members do — even the Member who
                is speaking. If he is going to talk about &quot;other
                paramilitary groups&quot;, I wish he would name them because I
                am fed up with his not naming them. Is he talking about me? If
                so, I would like to be able to answer the allegations that he
                makes.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Initial Presiding Officer:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have already made it clear that when
                Members speak in general terms they have a degree of cover in
                that their words cannot be taken as being unparliamentary. The
                more particular they are, the more they come to the edge. This
                may be frustrating for the Member, and I understand that.
                However, if Members are precise and particular, they are more
                likely to fall foul of privilege and be accused of using
                unparliamentary language.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr C Wilson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thought that I made it very clear. I will
                help Mr&nbsp;Hutchinson: I was referring to parties which
                continue to front fully-active paramilitary groups, which are
                inextricably linked to those groups, and which are clearly in
                breach of the commitment to use solely the democratic process to
                achieve their political goals. If Mr&nbsp;Hutchinson feels that
                his party is associated with groups such as I have described,
                that is a matter for him. He is the best judge of that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to the pledge of office, the
                issue of decommissioning is currently occupying minds. You will
                recall, Mr&nbsp;Initial Presiding Officer, that several weeks
                ago the entire Unionist family represented in this Chamber
                endorsed a motion that stated</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;any party inextricably linked with a
                paramilitary organisation retaining arms cannot give a total and
                absolute commitment to exclusively democratic means of resolving
                differences on political issues or oppose the use or threat of
                force by others for such purposes.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For that reason, the issue of
                decommissioning, which we are currently facing, is of no great
                consequence. This is because the Unionist Members in the Chamber
                have declared that until the parties represented end their
                associations and affiliations with paramilitary groups that are
                fully active and operational in the Province, they cannot make
                the &quot;Declaration of Support&quot; as required by the
                Belfast Agreement or meet the requirements of page&nbsp;1 of the
                Code of Conduct.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Even if there were a change of heart on the
                part of the Republican movement, which is represented by
                Sinn&nbsp;Féin, it would have to meet the requirement to stand
                down its forces, which are armed and fully prepared to return to
                war.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Initial Presiding
                Officer. Unfortunately I was out of the Chamber, but I did hear
                that you had made an adjudication, if not necessarily a full
                ruling. It reminded me of a discussion at a previous session
                when, because only two members of Sinn&nbsp;Féin were singled
                out, even though they were not mentioned by name, it was
                perceived that it was not specifically the whole group that was
                being challenged. Given that the Progressive Unionist Party has
                only two Members in this Chamber are you not out of order in
                some respects, Mr&nbsp;Initial Presiding Officer, in not linking
                those two circumstances together?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Furthermore, could you clarify the issue of
                fronting paramilitary organisations. What does
                &quot;fronting&quot; mean? If you require assistance from
                Mr&nbsp;Cedric&nbsp;Wilson, I am sure he would be more than keen
                to deliver it. I would also like you to consider a previous
                ruling on the issue of two Sinn&nbsp;Féin Members being singled
                out but not named as potentially taking up ministerial posts.
                The two sets of circumstances are absolutely similar, and I
                fancy that Mr&nbsp;Cedric&nbsp;Wilson is sailing close to the
                wind, as you suggested others were on that day.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One needs to be a little careful in raising
                points of order about matters which were spoken of in the
                Chamber if one was not watching or listening to what was said.
                The Member did not mention the party of which you are a member.
                It was your colleague who raised that question, and therefore
                the matter which you raise does not apply in respect of a
                limited number of Members. That is absolutely clear.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ervine:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Further to that point of order. I must point
                out that there is a continuous cacophony of language used in
                this Chamber mostly, I would have to say, directed at Sinn&nbsp;Féin.
                Others have drawn in the Progressive Unionist Party at various
                times and lumped it in with Sinn&nbsp;Féin, the perception
                being that it is associated with paramilitary organisations. I
                challenge your suggestion that I do not have the right to
                comment even though I saw the proceedings in my office as they
                were played out.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Having said that, one needs to consider the
                fact that the perception from some Benches is that there is more
                than one party associated with paramilitary organisations.
                Mr&nbsp;Wilson did not say &quot;group&quot; or
                &quot;party&quot;; he said &quot;parties&quot;. He therefore
                included the Progressive Unionist Party. I require, either on
                your part, Mr&nbsp;Initial Presiding Officer, or in consultation
                with Mr&nbsp;Wilson, some definition of the word
                &quot;fronting&quot;.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You have raised a number of matters. One
                matter which I must raise is the question of challenging
                rulings. Secondly, as far as observing the proceedings from
                outside is concerned, that is justifiable. It is the convention
                in other places that Members who wish to participate in debates
                listen to the speeches coming before and after; in some places
                it is the convention that Members sit through the whole debate
                if they wish to intervene. While the latter is a very
                restrictive convention the former convention is not an entirely
                unreasonable one.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will study Hansard, as I always do. If
                there are matters which need to be brought to the attention of
                the Assembly I will bring them, with due conscientiousness.
                However, I have to point out that there are times when Members
                themselves put matters on the record. They put matters into
                Hansard by raising them, responding to them, or objecting to
                them. On a number of occasions remarks would not have been on
                the record if they had not been responded to.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will look at this particular matter, and I
                will study it. I have looked at it already in terms of the
                relevance of various speeches to what is being said, and I am
                persuaded that within certain bounds the speeches have been
                relevant. I will address the matter which the Member raises.
                However, I must say that at this point I am not convinced by the
                point of order that he raises, and has raised reasonably
                extensively.</p>

                operate under the rules and procedures which we have created
                here. Continuously reminding Members of conventions in other
                places may be perfectly reasonable for those who understand the
                workings of other places, but it is a one-liner put-down to tell
                people who do not understand the workings of those other places
                that they should behave in a different way.</p>

                in situations where the Initial Standing Orders are not
                adequate. No Member has challenged that. ‘Erskine&nbsp;May’
                is available for all Members to read and when the Assembly’s
                Standing Orders are brought forward in full, I suspect there

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let me make it clear, lest I did not refer
                specifically and sufficiently clearly to the point raised by
                Mr&nbsp;Ervine, that it is not for me to produce definitions of
                what Members are saying. If Members do not wish to spell
                something out — for whatever reason — that is a matter for
                them. It is not for me to challenge them to be more clear in
                their speech. I do have to say, however, that in referring back
                to one of the things that was said earlier, I am not sure that
                you have strengthened the point of order that the Member you
                referred to has raised — in fact, quite the opposite, I
                suspect.</p>

                Member who has not heard the remarks made to raise them as a
                point of order? He has, of course, the right to read Hansard and
                then draw your attention to the matter, but he cannot raise it
                on hearsay. Surely that ruling has to be adhered to.</p>

                he had heard it from the media, but on clarification he made it
                clear that he had seen it on the annunciator. I can amplify
                further. On the specific point that the Member raises, I believe
                that it is not unreasonable that when Members are participating
                in debate, they should be prepared, if at all possible, to wait
                for the person speaking before them and the person speaking
                after them. I am advised that there may be some Members who may
                not wish to do that, and the Committee on Standing Orders or
                other Committees of the Assembly may wish to address such
                matters. However, I do not think that it is an improper thing to

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Surely, Sir, you need to look at that again.
                No annunciator is accepted in the House of Commons. A Member
                there cannot get up and say that while he was sitting in his
                room watching the debate, he heard a Member make such-and-such a
                comment and he wants to challenge it. If that Member was not at
                the meeting, the only way he can challenge a point is to check
                the Hansard Report. Even the media that records proceedings in
                the House of Commons is not accepted as a means of checking the
                contents of people’s speeches, as we found out when we raised
                certain matters in the House of Commons.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Initial Presiding Officer:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I may find it necessary — and I have not
                done so up until now — to invoke the practice of taking points
                of order at a time of the Speaker’s choosing, otherwise the
                poor joint Chairman of the Standing Orders Committee will have
                expired before he has had the opportunity of winding up.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is clearly a matter of dispute between
                Members here. At least it is better that the Member saw it on
                the screen rather than his relying on hearsay, which was the
                accusation previously made against him. He has made it clear
                that he saw it; he brought it here; the matter has been spoken
                of, and it has been ruled upon. I propose that we leave there
                and give the joint Chairman the opportunity of winding up the
                debate.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am very glad to say that the reports of my
                expiring are decidedly premature. And my wife and children are
                delighted.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A number of matters have been raised, and I
                would like to refer to them in order.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, I want to thank Mr&nbsp;Nigel&nbsp;Dodds
                for his remarks. He points out that the report does not make any
                recommendation in regard to the appointment of a Commissioner.
                That may well be the case, but it was our view that this issue
                was best left to the Committee of Standards and Privileges, and
                they may recommend the appointment of a Commissioner.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dodds also raised the matter of when the
                Committee would be appointed. It should be appointed immediately
                devolution takes place, but it is a matter for the Assembly to
                decide whether it wishes to act prior to that. It would be
                difficult for a Committee of Standards and Privileges to act in
                a proper way unless a Clerk of Standards and a Commissioner were
                appointed at about the same time. There might be some difficulty
                about that, but it is something that we could, perhaps, look at
                again.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition, Mr&nbsp;Dodds raised the issue
                of the Committee’s having the power to tweak and adjust the
                rules as time goes on; he welcomed that, as do I.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank my Colleague Mr&nbsp;Eamonn&nbsp;ONeill
                for his kind remarks.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Whether district council payments are
                registrable interests is an interesting question, one that I
                have not considered. The Committee on Standards and Privileges
                should look at that in detail. By and large the registration of
                interests relates to areas where a Member may derive a pecuniary
                or other valuable interest from his advocacy in the Assembly,
                and it is not clear whether or not that would be the case.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a general principle, if someone is elected
                to a public position, and, therefore, is in the public domain,
                the registration of interests is intended to overcome the
                difficulty of people not knowing Member’s interests, so I
                think it should be included, along with membership of the House
                of Commons, or any other public position.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Robinson is obviously a much more
                experienced parliamentarian than I am, and I defer to his
                judgement in this matter, but I still think that the matter is
                best left to the Committee on Standards and Privileges, which
                can work out an exact protocol for it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Colleague Mr&nbsp;Eamonn&nbsp;ONeill also
                raised the matter of the Clerk of Standards and the degree of
                power that he will have. The Clerk of Standards will be the
                chief administrator in this area: he will act as Clerk to the
                new Committee and maintain the Register. However, on the other
                hand, the Commissioner will be an independent appointee who will
                advise Members on standards and oversee the system of
                registration. Some of these matters will be presented in more
                detail when the Standing Orders become available, and I ask my
                Colleague Mr&nbsp;ONeill to wait until then.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr ONeill also raised the matter of an
                appeals procedure. I will require some time to look into this,
                but I will come back to him.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr ONeill, Mr Molloy and Mr&nbsp;Dallat
                raised, in turn, the question of membership of various Orders
                and organisations, whether open, semi-secret or oath-bound.
                There is a very particular Northern&nbsp;Ireland angle to this,
                and it will need to be looked at in some detail. The Westminster
                model does not require registration of the membership of such
                bodies. I am given to understand that the Welsh are considering
                a requirement for members of the New Welsh Assembly to register
                if they are members of the Masonic&nbsp;Order. The Committee on
                Standards and Privileges will need to look very carefully at the
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland angle to this — it is not a matter that
                I am prepared to give an off-the-cuff judgement on at the
                moment.</p>

                and I hope he will agree that none of them requires any specific

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This debate has been requested by five of the
                six Members for South Antrim. Unfortunately, the DUP Member is
                the exception. It has been inspired by two factors. First, there
                is the nuisance that is suffered by many of our constituents in
                the Mallusk area; secondly, there is a desperate need for a
                regional strategy for disposal of waste, especially in the
                Greater Belfast area.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is not just a Mallusk problem. Members
                from East Antrim will be well aware of the problems around
                Magheramourne and the threats to the environment in that area.
                At this stage Mallusk is clearly suffering most, and we shall
                outline the problems and suggest some solutions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The saga began in 1988 at Cottonmount when
                part of Boyd’s quarry, which some Members may remember for
                motor trials, was suggested as a possible site for landfill. A
                detailed public inquiry was held at that stage, and planning
                permission was granted for a small part of the quarry for four
                or five years. Immediately after planning permission was
                granted, UK&nbsp;Waste became the operators.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Residents say that many problems, such as
                smell, birds and flies, litter blow and the inevitable traffic,
                started at that time. In fairness, UK&nbsp;Waste has made some
                efforts to reduce those problems, but it has failed to satisfy
                the concerns of residents.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mallusk is not an area with a few residents,
                as it was some years ago. It is becoming more and more built up.
                Even in the past seven years, since the boundary review, Mallusk
                ward clearly has the highest population in Newtownabbey. It is
                now more than 50% over the average for Newtownabbey wards, and
                that was in advance of the most recent approval of planning
                permission for a major greenfield housing site in the area.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is quite clear that the area is becoming
                less suitable for the operation of a landfill site though it may
                have been acceptable for a few years. I need to be careful here
                because of the sub judice rule, but I can say that there has
                been a new application for a massive extension that would carry
                four million tonnes of waste — a huge proportion of the total
                waste that is generated in Northern&nbsp;Ireland — for
                20&nbsp;years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In a judicial review, the courts have
                instructed the Department of the Environment to grant planning
                permission, although the Minister is appealing that decision.
                Without prejudice to that judicial review, it is my opinion that
                to grant permission for a single landfill site on such a scale
                at a time when we are about to approve a waste management
                strategy for Northern&nbsp;Ireland, would make such a strategy
                unviable if that were not predicated upon this site being the
                major dump.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A second major landfill site is about to come
                back into operation, and doubtless the Members for Belfast can
                tell us about that. It is my understanding that Belfast City
                Council intends to keep to itself the four or five years’
                lifetime that it has on the foreshore.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The strategy document that we need to
                consider was produced in draft form in June last year. We do not
                know when the Department is going to produce the final version.
                The document makes it clear that Northern&nbsp;Ireland’s waste
                management is well behind European practice.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It sets out four principal objectives: the
                need to reduce the amount of waste generated in the first place
                — and we all know the problems of packaging and so on; the
                need to make best use of that waste which is generated; the need
                to encourage practices which minimise damage and nuisance; and
                the need to move waste handling up the hierarchy of waste
                management. That means that reduction of waste is to be
                preferred to reuse of waste, which is to be preferred to
                recycling of waste, which is to be preferred to recovery of
                waste, which is to be preferred to landfill.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The document says that there will be a
                planning policy statement from the Department which, at least in
                draft, is likely to favour co-ordinated plans and strategic
                facilities to avoid environmental impact and nuisance, moving
                waste up the hierarchy and regarding landfill as an option only
                when it is possible under the best practice guidelines. Targets
                are laid out within that, based on European targets which
                suggest that landfill should be cut to 75% of its 1995 levels by
                2006 and to 35% of those levels by 2016. Those are optimistic
                targets and, perhaps, unrealistic. It will be interesting to see
                if they survive in the final version. We will require a massive
                initiative to get anywhere near the 75% target, never mind the
                35% one.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need that kind of strategy at regional
                level, but it will run into major problems if what the residents
                would describe as a &quot;superdump&quot; at Mallusk is allowed
                to proceed with a lifetime of 20&nbsp;years and taking virtually
                all the waste produced in Greater&nbsp;Belfast. Such a landfill
                site, if it goes ahead on a traditional basis with mixed
                domestic and industrial waste of every kind, including the
                organic waste that leads to problems with methane and run-off,
                will bring about a major conflict in the area between the
                increasing population and the difficulties with the kind of
                waste which will be dumped.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have some sympathy with UK&nbsp;Waste. The
                delays that it is suffering from are the same delays as those of
                us on councils that are using its dumps are suffering from and
                that the residents are suffering from. Antrim Council, of which
                I am a member, applied five-and-a-half years ago for planning
                permission for a relatively modest operation, a single landfill
                site to serve Antrim and possibly Ballymena. The Department has
                still not given us a response, just as it has failed to give a
                response to UK&nbsp;Waste.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If an operation on that scale has been held
                up by the need for a strategic plan, there is clearly a failure
                within the Department to sort out its business. Clearly, when
                the Assembly gets powers, and when a Minister accountable to the
                Assembly is responsible for the Department of the Environment as
                it is at present, the matter of regional strategic planning for
                waste management must be a major priority.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must create a cultural change to promote
                waste reduction, reuse, recycling and recovery. At the moment,
                the strategy in the draft plan is extremely vague. It is totally
                unclear how this cultural change will come about. There are
                great problems, given the scale of operations in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland, and even at regional level, with creating
                the critical mass necessary to promote recycling. Even with
                cross-border co-operation, that critical mass may be difficult
                to attain, in comparison with what happens in Great&nbsp;Britain
                or on the European mainland.</p>

                things seriously.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In particular, we have to be prepared to
                examine the issue of energy recovery by way of an
                energy-from-waste scheme. We need to deal with that which cannot
                be reused or recycled. I know there are major concerns — we
                all probably received mail from Friends of the Earth, Belfast,
                about the dangers of dioxins. I am also aware that
                energy-from-waste schemes are working well in other parts of
                Europe, including inner south London, so there are options which
                we need to examine to ascertain the facts and see what is
                possible.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In years to come Cottonmount may prove to be
                an acceptable site for the disposal of predominantly inert waste
                from an energy plant, but we need to have a strategic plan in
                place. We needed one three years ago, not just this year, and it
                must be a priority in fairness to all concerned, whether they be
                the councils that use the facility or the companies which run
                the facility, or the residents in Mallusk, and they are the most
                important of all.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Boyd:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This issue has come before the House because
                of errors made by the Department of the Environment as a result
                of which many residents in the Mallusk area of Newtownabbey have
                had to endure a direct, negative impact.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1988 a local quarryman applied to turn a
                redundant part of his quarry complex at Mallusk into a landfill
                site for municipal and other wastes that would take
                30,000&nbsp;tonnes of waste per annum. There were strong local
                objections to that including objections from Newtownabbey
                Borough Council. A public inquiry was called at which objectors
                gave evidence for their belief that a landfill site was
                incompatible with the surrounding residential, recreational and
                agricultural lands and waters. It was also pointed out that
                landfill was not regarded in Europe as the best method of waste
                disposal, and it was revealed at the public meeting that the
                proposed tonnage had been increased to 250,000&nbsp;tonnes per
                annum.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Under EC regulations an environmental impact
                assessment (EIA) should have been prepared. This latter point
                was acknowledged by the Department of the Environment
                representative, but he then admitted that the Department had
                failed to give notice to the applicant within the specified
                period and could not therefore request an EIA.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A range of consultants for the applicant and
                the so-called experts for the Department of the Environment gave
                evidence to the effect that with modern landfill techniques you
                could put a landfill site anywhere with none of the problems of
                smell, birds, litter and dirt associated with old-style
                landfills. The inquiry was told on a number of occasions that
                there was no intention to extend landfilling beyond the area of
                redundant quarry known as Cottonmount&nbsp;Quarry and that the
                increased tonnage to be put into the site would mean that the
                full amenity of the area would be restored in four to five
                years. The inquiry found for the applicant and planning
                permission was granted.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1995 it was revealed that UK&nbsp;Waste
                had leased the Cottonmount&nbsp;Quarry and intended taking the
                City of Belfast waste to Mallusk up to the year&nbsp;2000. It
                was also revealed that it had applied for planning permission
                for the remainder of the quarry complex, which would extend
                dumping by another 20&nbsp;years. UK&nbsp;Waste stated that
                within six months of starting operations, the residents would
                not know that the company was there. Dumping began at the end of
                February&nbsp;1996, and the impact on the area began to be felt.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All the fears of the residents who had
                opposed the planning application were now realised. There was
                the smell, the birds and the litter, both wind-blown and that
                falling off lorries, and the roads and footpaths became
                hazardous because of the dirt and volume and speed of traffic.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A number of meetings were held between the
                residents and UK&nbsp;Waste, but the problems were not resolved.
                Indeed, they have increased.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A public meeting was held on 6&nbsp;February
                this year. It was attended by 300&nbsp;residents. Their plight
                was heard in detail, and numerous public-health issues were
                raised. Many residents are unable to enjoy time in their garden
                because of the strong smell, which makes some people ill; the
                problems for asthma sufferers are increasing because of the poor
                quality of the air, but they are unable to open any windows
                (Sunday appears to be the day when the smell is worst); large
                numbers of birds generate a huge amount of droppings on the area
                and on nearby farmland; the rockets used to deter the birds are
                very loud and frighten pets; there is increased litter on the
                Bernice&nbsp;Road and in surrounding areas; there is an
                unacceptable volume of traffic that has resulted in increased
                congestion, speeding and dirt.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are several instances of mice and rats
                in the residential area, and there are numerous flies, which
                means people cannot open their windows. Food has to be covered
                while being eaten. As an example of the problem, 60 bluebottles
                were found in a kitchen in one week. These cases are not
                isolated and are clearly unacceptable.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The problem has been exacerbated by a recent
                High Court judgement issuing an order to compel the Department
                of the Environment to provide planning permission for the second
                phase of the landfill development operated by UK&nbsp;Waste
                Management Limited. This ruling would enable waste from Belfast
                and surrounding areas to be taken to Cottonmount for the next
                20&nbsp;years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1997 the residents wrote to the Planning
                Service to object to phase two as so many problems were still
                unresolved from phase one. The Planning Service’s opinion
                failed to take account of EC legislation, which requires areas
                of separation between landfills and residential and recreational
                areas. The Planning Service’s opinion also gives a competitive
                advantage by placing 50% of all waste management in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland in one company.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In February&nbsp;1998 Newtownabbey Borough
                Council commissioned an independent survey of odour problems in
                the area of Baird’s&nbsp;Brae landfill site at Mallusk Road,
                Newtownabbey. The report stated that the site is situated in an
                area of mixed development with light industrial, commercial and
                extensive residential developments all located within
                200&nbsp;metres of the site boundary.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The summary of the report states that odour
                levels at Baird’s&nbsp;Brae were encountered at offensive
                levels on all four site visits and that these were due mainly to
                operational practice, principally to a combination of a large
                active area and landfill gas venting into the atmosphere. The
                current position is that Lord&nbsp;Dubs, Minister for the
                Environment, has lodged an appeal against the recent court
                ruling.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Waste management practice in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland is lagging behind some other parts of
                Europe. There is an obligation on the Government to ensure that
                waste management here develops closely in line with the rest of
                the United Kingdom and European directives. One of those
                objectives is to reduce considerably the volume of municipal
                waste, and therefore phase&nbsp;two at Mallusk would be in
                direct contravention of European Community directives.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is clear, therefore, that alternatives to
                landfill in Northern&nbsp;Ireland must be implemented as a waste
                strategy, including the reuse of waste and increased recycling.
                The question of waste management schemes must be studied in
                detail and should be left to locally elected representatives in
                the Assembly to formulate and implement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There must be no further development of
                landfill sites at Mallusk or elsewhere in Northern&nbsp;Ireland,
                and any such proposals must be rejected. Resolutions to the
                current problems must be speedily achieved. High standards of
                public life and protection of the environment are key
                responsibilities of elected representatives and fundamental
                requirements of responsible government.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr J Wilson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Belfast City, Larne, North Down, Ards,
                Carrickfergus, Antrim and Newtownabbey dump their rubbish at
                Baird’s Brae in Mallusk. I hope that these local government
                districts have other plans for the future because the residents
                of Mallusk are not planning to be everybody’s backyard
                indefinitely. &quot;Not in my backyard, but it is OK in
                yours&quot; has been the solution offered by Northern Ireland
                administrators for far too long.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Perhaps I should not admit being able to
                remember the pit at the back of my grandfather’s terrace
                house. Rubbish was shovelled out of it and transported by
                tractor and trailer to a nearby tip head or hole in the ground—
                a haven for gulls, rats and scavenging dogs. That was in the
                late ’40s. Fifty&nbsp;years later, approaching a new
                millennium, the pit has become a wheelie bin, the tractor has
                become a labour-saving bin lorry and the hole in the ground is
                still a hole in the ground with a liner, and we call it land
                reclamation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This debate is timely and necessary. It is
                timely because it will point up the need to look objectively
                and, indeed, subjectively at the real issues associated with
                landfill, and it is necessary because Northern&nbsp;Ireland is
                fast approaching a crossroads and will have to confront head-on
                what is to happen to its rubbish and waste in the years to come.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We all acknowledge that landfill is an
                emotive subject and that we would not like to live near such a
                site. Yet, as a community, we generate waste — one&nbsp;tonne
                of it per household each year. It is collected from outside our
                houses, taken to a place that is well away from where most of us
                live and then forgotten about.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is not as simple as that for some
                300&nbsp;residents in Mallusk who are directly affected by a
                landfill site. These residents live near a landfill site, a
                facility that, quite understandably, causes them to be angry.
                They are opposed to the operation; they complain about what it
                does to their area; and they are demanding action. And why not?
                It is right that this debate should reflect their feelings, and
                it is also right that we, as elected representatives, should
                look at the wider picture: what would happen to the 350,000 to
                400,000&nbsp;tonnes of waste from seven district council areas
                that is deposited annually if there were not a Baird’s&nbsp;Brae
                landfill site?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to be as fair and objective as
                possible. First, the residents have raised objections to what
                could be termed as a spin-off from the UK&nbsp;Waste’s
                management site. They say that there is a smell — and there is
                — and that birds, flies, rodents and litter are major
                problems.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">UK Waste, for its part, insists that it is
                the best and most professionally managed landfill site in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland, if not on the entire island of Ireland.
                The company, regarded nationally as an industry leader, has
                invested £0.25&nbsp;million in installing a range of measures
                designed to reduce the nuisance caused to the local community.
                These measures have operating running costs of £60,000&nbsp;per
                year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The company states that 70&nbsp;nozzles are
                used to spray natural oils on to the site to suppress the smell.
                This system, which is unique in Northern&nbsp;Ireland, works
                24&nbsp;hours a day, 365&nbsp;days per year, and the company
                claims that it also serves to eliminate ash and other fine
                particles from the air.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">UK&nbsp;Waste operates the largest gas system
                in the Province, burning off 2,000&nbsp;cubic metres of gas per
                hour. Plans are in place to use this gas to generate electricity
                — enough power to meet the needs of a large village or a small
                town. Green energy from waste has certain attractions: it
                reduces dependence on coal; cuts levels of methane; and
                minimises the damaging greenhouse effect. An ambitious plan such
                as this should be welcomed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The condition of the approach road to the
                landfill site is a major issue. UK&nbsp;Waste says that
                mechanical sweepers sweep the main road daily, while on the site
                a wheel-wash system cleans every vehicle as it leaves. Still the
                road is a mess. It is not designed for the volume of heavy
                vehicles which travel to and from the dump.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the perimeter of the landfill site there
                is a 30-foot litter fence. The fence is backed up by mobile
                litter screens which are placed beside a refuse vehicle while it
                is tipping. An enclosed storm area, built at a cost of £50,000,
                is used in inclement weather. Yet the residents say that there
                is a litter problem in the district.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A range of measures is used to counter
                nuisance from birds. They minimise any inconvenience to
                residents while, at the same time, serve as a deterrent to
                birds. The residents give a graphic description about living
                under the flight paths of these birds. I will not go into the
                detail.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What about rats and other vermin? According
                to the company and the environmental health body Northern Group
                Systems, which acts for Newtownabbey, Larne and Ballymena
                councils, there is no evidence of infestation above the level
                associated with a semi-rural location. The residents strongly
                disagree.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Stringent controls are also in place to deal
                with flies. The Department of Agriculture audited the landfill
                site and said that there was no fly problem on the site. Again
                the residents strongly disagree.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">UK Waste insists that it is doing all that it
                can to address the concerns of the local residents. Many of
                their comments have been taken on board, and the company was
                instrumental in setting up a liaison group as a means of
                creating two-way dialogue.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.30 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In short, it tries to adopt the
                good-neighbour approach. The residents do not want a major
                landfill site operator to be their neighbour. What about the
                future? The landfill will reach the end of its useful life in
                14&nbsp;months or so. One third of the area has been restored to
                a greenfield site and another third will be completed by the end
                of the year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Four years ago the firm applied to extend its
                operations, phase&nbsp;two at Boyd’s quarry, and recently it
                applied successfully for a judicial review in the High Court to
                get the Department of the Environment to make a decision. The
                Department is now appealing this decision in the Court of
                Appeal, so further delay is inevitable. Time, of course, is of
                the essence.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The company needs to know what is going to
                happen from the points of view of both investment and forward
                planning. We are running out of landfill, and that presents an
                enormous headache for the seven councils which currently use
                UK&nbsp;Waste facilities. But it is not just a problem for
                councils. About 150&nbsp;companies, which between them employ
                20,000&nbsp;people, depend on UK&nbsp;Waste to handle their dry,
                commercial, non-hazardous waste. They too are looking on with a
                degree of uncertainty and trepidation. If they cannot dispose of
                their waste material, what impact will it have on their
                operations? It is easy to stand here and criticise, but
                UK&nbsp;Waste performs a vital function without which there
                would be total chaos.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Properly managed landfill is needed, even
                though it is not the ideal solution. The company acknowledges
                the difficulties and would much prefer to see an integrated
                solution to our refuse problem. It is also worth noting the
                extent to which UK&nbsp;Waste operations have benefited the wide
                range of schemes in the region.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Over the past two years UK&nbsp;Waste has
                facilitated over £650,000 for environmental programmes through
                the landfill tax credit scheme. Four&nbsp;hundred&nbsp;thousand
                pounds of this has been earmarked for projects in the
                Newtownabbey area, many of which are in the immediate vicinity
                of the site.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">UK Waste is a reputable company — a good
                corporate citizen doing a difficult job as best it can. It knows
                that there are problems and no easy answers. It says itself that
                it does not produce waste — it manages the community’s
                waste. It is our problem and a problem that will not be solved
                by dumping our rubbish in a hole in the ground some place not
                near our homes. The residents of Mallusk do not want a dump near
                their homes.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dalton:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are here today to discuss an issue which
                is of concern not only to my constituents in Mallusk but to the
                wider community in Belfast and throughout Northern&nbsp;Ireland.
                Mr&nbsp;Boyd has outlined a good deal of the background in
                relation to this site, but I will go over some of it again.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The site was created in 1988 when
                Derek&nbsp;Boyd, a local quarry man, applied to turn a redundant
                part of his quarry into a landfill site. The original estimate
                was that the site would contain 30,000&nbsp;tonnes of waste. A
                public inquiry was called, and during the inquiry it was
                discovered that 250,000&nbsp;tonnes of waste would be put into
                the site per annum — a lot more than the 30,000&nbsp;tonnes
                originally envisaged.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a consequence of that, an environmental
                impact assessment should have been carried out, but because of
                the Department of the Environment’s failure to ask the
                applicant to fulfil such an obligation within the requisite time
                period, no impact assessment was ever conducted. The public
                inquiry heard from the local residents; it heard from various
                experts; it heard from people who said that the landfill site
                would not be a nuisance and would not cause any major concern to
                the local residents; and it also heard from people who said that
                it would all be finished within four or five years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1995 the site was leased from
                James&nbsp;Boyd&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Sons by UK&nbsp;Waste, which has
                leased the site until the year&nbsp;2000. It started running it
                in February&nbsp;1996, and since then my constituents and the
                people who live in and around the site in Mallusk have had to
                suffer the smell that emanates constantly from this dump, a
                smell that is so unpleasant that during the summer months the
                children do not want to play in their back gardens. People do
                not want to go outside, and they cannot hold barbecues, as many
                of us like to do, during the summer months. That is an
                unacceptable burden on the residents, and it is just the tip of
                the iceberg.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thousands of birds regularly scavenge on the
                site and then fly across the residential areas leaving waste
                deposits. Local residents have to endure bird waste covering
                houses, cars and clothes. Some residents recently complained
                that they had seen rats around their homes and in the area.
                There seems to be a development of rats and mice about the site,
                and that is a major public health issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">UK Waste recently applied to extend the site
                in what it calls phase II of the operation to develop a larger
                site that will have a capacity of more than 300,000&nbsp;tonnes.
                It will be used for approximately 20 to 25&nbsp;years. There has
                been no public inquiry in relation to that site because the
                Department relied on the fact that there had been a public
                inquiry into phase&nbsp;I — a smaller site. As that public
                inquiry had determined that that had been a suitable area for
                landfill, the Department decided that there would be no problem
                over allowing a further site there. The Department duly issued a
                notice of opinion to the applicants — UK&nbsp;Waste —
                stating that full planning permission would be granted for the
                application for phase&nbsp;II.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since that notice was issued, the Department
                has started to develop, as my Colleague Mr&nbsp;Ford has said, a
                waste management strategy for Northern Ireland. It had realised
                that if it sited at Mallusk an enormous landfill with the
                capacity to take nearly one third of the Province’s entire
                waste, it would skew any possible consideration of a properly
                developed waste management strategy for the entire Province.
                Fortunately, it told the company that the application would not
                be approved at that stage, and it has been withholding a
                decision.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Colleagues have said that the company has
                successfully applied for judicial review to get the Department
                to make a decision. The Department has now gone to the Court of
                Appeal. If it were not sub judice I could go into some of the
                issues relating to the High&nbsp;Court judgement. I question the
                judgement of some of the lawyers in deciding to appeal. The
                Department has an opportunity to make a decision now; it does
                not need to appeal.</font><font SIZE="1"></p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Weir:</p>
                </font></b><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is the Member aware that this is part of a
                wider problem of delayed decisions by the Department of the
                Environment? In my constituency, there is the possibility of a
                sewerage works in either north Down or Ards. The report
                recommending the site for the works was submitted to the
                Department before Christmas, but there have been many delays in
                announcing the site, and the Department seems to be dragging its
                feet over similar decisions.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dalton:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I cannot add to my Colleague’s comments
                about that site. The Department may be dragging its feet, but
                perhaps it has a good reason. I suspect that other Members share
                my view that the development of a proper waste management
                strategy for Northern&nbsp;Ireland should not be decided by
                Lord&nbsp;Dubs, by any other Minister from across the water, or
                by civil servants in the Department of the Environment. It will
                affect the development of this Province for the next 20 to
                25&nbsp;years or more, and it should be decided by Assembly
                Members and Ministers. We were elected by local people and are
                accountable to them and not to people in middle England.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the earliest opportunity, the Assembly
                should take upon itself the role of determining a future
                strategy for waste management. As soon as we have ministerial
                responsibility, the statutory committee on the environment
                should urgently look at this issue and work with the Department
                to develop a proper waste management strategy for the entire
                Province. Only after such a strategy has been developed can the
                relevant Minister make a decision on the Baird’s&nbsp;Brae
                site.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we are going to develop a proper strategy
                for Northern&nbsp;Ireland, we will have to take account of some
                of the issues raised by Mr&nbsp;Ford. We produce an enormous
                quantity of rubbish from our houses every year, so it is
                important that we try to deal with that rubbish, and not just
                bury it in a hole in the ground.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should seriously consider the use of
                recycling facilities and the possibility of creating facilities
                that could generate electricity from this waste. Rubbish is not
                just something that we should bury in a hole in the ground —
                it is an asset that can be used for the benefit of the whole
                community. If we just bury it, we are storing up problems for
                future generations and wasting a valuable asset.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would also suggest that Belfast City
                Council, as it considers the development of the waste management
                strategy for the Belfast area, should consider how the waste
                generated in the Greater&nbsp;Belfast area — 150,000 to
                200,000&nbsp;tonnes of waste — affects other areas. Belfast
                City Council has the opportunity to lead the way in this field
                and to assist the rest of us in the development of a waste
                management strategy for the Province as a whole.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that the development of the
                Cottonmount site does not go ahead because Mallusk is a
                residential area. It may not have been when the site was first
                developed, but it is an area of considerable population growth
                now. There are 1,000&nbsp;houses to be built in that area in the
                near future. It is unreasonable to expect so many people to live
                so close to a landfill site, and I hope that this development
                does not go ahead.</p>

                Mr&nbsp;Clyde would be afforded the opportunity to take part in

                that point, but I have no doubt that Mr&nbsp;Clyde will want to
                contribute to this debate, given his past interest in the
                matter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to begin by thanking
                Mr&nbsp;Ford. His comments on the waste-management strategy
                consultation document were very helpful and incisive. I would
                like also to thank Mr&nbsp;Boyd, who took us so eloquently
                through the chronological events relating to the landfill site
                at Mallusk, and Mr&nbsp;J&nbsp;Wilson, who spent some time on
                the problems relating to the site at Cottonmount and who, like
                myself, believes this to be a wider problem, affecting not just
                the people in the Cottonmount area.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also agree with much of what Mr&nbsp;Dalton
                said. He also stated that this was not just a problem for the
                south Antrim and Greater Belfast areas — it is a problem for
                the entire community. Quite rightly, he said that, the sooner
                the Assembly assumes responsibility for these matters, the
                sooner we will be able to resolve these problems.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The word &quot;crisis&quot; has been overused
                in our debates, but I believe that we do face a crisis in waste
                management. There is a major problem with waste disposal
                throughout Northern&nbsp;Ireland, and particularly in the south
                Antrim/Greater Belfast area. We are still waiting for the
                Government’s final statement on a waste-management strategy.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.45 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of the Environment has quite
                rightly attracted very strong criticism for its failure to deal
                with the problem and to implement the waste-management strategy
                following consultation, which will facilitate, among other
                things, planning decisions on landfill sites.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While everyone agrees that a strategy is
                required sooner rather than later, the reality is that decisions
                must be made. Any delay in agreeing this document will create
                further problems. Urgent action is required.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The responsible Department has always
                responded to planning applications in the past by saying</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The priority is not to predetermine the
                balance, nature and number of waste disposal methods and
                facilities in advance of the waste management strategy&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is a cop-out. It fails to respond to the
                growing needs of the community in dealing with a very serious
                environmental problem.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Because of this ongoing crisis the Department
                of the Environment has sometimes turned policy on its head. With
                planning logjams and other problems it has been forced to
                facilitate Belfast City Council. It was originally required to
                close the Dargan&nbsp;Road foreshore site by the year&nbsp;2000.
                Because of the impending crisis the Department has, at a stroke,
                given Belfast City Council a five-year extension to the site.
                Consequently there will be a continuing environmental impact on
                a partially contained foreshore site. This site is the source of
                many problems as it is not fully contained and leaks into
                Belfast&nbsp;Lough. It has been criticised by environmental
                observers over the years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Therefore the Department of the Environment,
                in recognising the crisis faced by Belfast and Belfast alone, is
                applying double standards. It tells other councils that planning
                must await a regional strategy document, yet it has given
                Belfast City Council permission to extend a low-grade,
                high-impact site for another five&nbsp;years. It makes a
                nonsense —</p>

                polluter pay — those who originally produce the rubbish. I am
                thinking in particular of those who produce the
                non-biodegradable polystyrene trays and the cubic tonnage of
                non-degradable plastic. Has any Department yet made an effort to
                encourage the manufacturers to recycle? There was nothing wrong
                with the old idea that those who returned the bottles were
                rewarded.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McClelland:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Member for his comments. The
                concept of the polluter paying is in the document.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was making the point that the Department of
                the Environment has employed double standards in allowing
                Belfast City Council to extend the Dargan&nbsp;Road site. I, as
                other Members have done, welcome the draft consultant document
                on a waste-management strategy. It contains a commitment to
                sustainable development, to the polluter paying, and it combines
                environmental, economic and social objectives. I also welcome
                its commitment to the effective protection of the environment
                and the prudent use of natural resources.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I understand that there are about seven and a
                half years of remaining landfill capacity for the whole of
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland. It is costly to the ratepayer.
                Transporting waste is costly and it attracts considerable public
                opposition due to the environmental problems.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am aware, as are other Members, of the
                problems of pollution, the environmental problems and, as
                Mr&nbsp;Boyd and others have rightly pointed out, the tremendous
                problems caused to the ratepayers of Newtownabbey. I am also
                aware that even if we have a new Waste To Energy plant in
                Belfast and ambitious new recycling plans, we will still need
                landfill sites as an outlet for industrial waste and ash
                residue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The reality is that the pace of development
                by the Department of the Environment in the waste-management
                sector did not keep pace with the requirements of the community.
                We have a crisis on our hands which is already presenting itself
                in the environmental impact in south Antrim and Greater Belfast
                and will do so in the other areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As other Members have said, this region
                requires a sound waste-management strategy. It is crucial to our
                social, economic and environmental well-being. The problems
                which face Newtownabbey and Greater Belfast are there because of
                the failures of Government Departments. We need this Assembly to
                start to make decisions and, if I may paraphrase another Member,
                this problem is not going to go away, you know.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Initial Presiding Officer:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Clyde, another Member for South
                Antrim, whom you mentioned in your comments, and a number of
                other Members wanted to speak in this debate. However, the
                requests were made after the sitting had commenced. That is why
                it has not been possible for Mr&nbsp;Clyde and other Members to
                take part. I think it is only fair, from his point of view, that
                I put the record straight.</p>
