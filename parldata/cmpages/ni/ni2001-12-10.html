                First Minister and the Deputy First Minister that they wish to
                make a statement on the British-Irish Council plenary meeting
                that was held on 30 November 2001 in Dublin.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister (Mr Durkan):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to make a statement on the second
                summit meeting of the British-Irish Council. All the Northern
                Irish Ministers who attended the meeting have approved this
                report, and it is made on their behalf.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister and I, together with the
                Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, the
                Minister of the Environment and the Minister of Agriculture and
                Rural Development, represented the Northern Ireland Executive.
                Representatives of the British and Irish Governments, the
                Scottish Executive, the National Assembly for Wales, the Isle of
                Man Government and the states of Jersey and Guernsey also
                attended.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The main focus of the meeting was the issue
                of drug misuse and the development of further co-operation in
                that area. The Minister of Health, Social Services and Public
                Safety explained the steps being taken by the Northern Ireland
                Executive. In particular, the British- Irish Council agreed
                elements of a framework for future co-operation which will focus
                on the two key areas of demand reduction, incorporating
                prevention and treatment, and supply reduction, incorporating
                law enforcement. This future co-operation will include the
                further development of information exchanges and joint actions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Among the areas covered by enhanced
                information exchange will be co-operation on models of best
                practice, research, data pilot programmes and rehabilitation and
                reintegration strategies. The Council also noted the importance
                of information technology in enhancing information exchange and
                agreed to further examination of possibilities in that area.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was agreed that specific joint actions
                could include joint awareness campaigns — for example,
                highlighting the risk of heroin use and targeting young people
                who use so-called recreational drugs. An agreement to develop
                joint training initiatives could also include exchange
                programmes for those members of the British-Irish Council who
                are engaged in drug-related work.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The importance of targeting the assets of
                criminals engaged in drug trafficking was widely acknowledged.
                In this context, the background to the establishment of the
                Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) in Ireland and its success in
                targeting the assets of drug barons was regarded as significant.
                To advance work in the agreed areas the Council established a
                group of senior officials with a mandate to prepare
                recommendations for future co-operation. Those will be reviewed
                by a ministerial meeting on drugs, and progress will be reported
                to a future British-Irish Council summit.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An update was provided on work being
                undertaken in sectoral areas by the relevant lead
                Administrations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the British-Irish Council environment
                sector meeting in London in October 2000, Ministers agreed that
                many environmental issues of mutual interest could be taken
                forward, with added value for all participants through closer
                co-operation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">From the range of topics discussed, it was
                agreed that several priority work areas would be taken forward
                with individual member Administrations in the lead.
                Consequently, the Irish Government and the Isle of Man are
                taking the lead in preparing a paper on radioactive waste from
                Sellafield. That will be discussed at a future meeting of the
                environment sector. I drew the Council’s attention to concerns
                raised by Members of this Assembly and stressed the importance
                of a full exchange of information on the issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The UK Government have taken the lead in
                examining issues of climate change. The climate change group has
                met twice and has agreed to extend the climate change scenarios
                of the forthcoming UK Climate Impacts Programme 2002 to cover
                all the British-Irish Council Administrations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Scottish Executive look forward to
                hosting the next British-Irish Council environment sector
                meeting in Edinburgh next spring. That will include a
                discussion, initiated and led by the Scottish Executive, on the
                difficulties and challenges of finding more sustainable ways of
                dealing with generated waste.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Scottish Executive and the National
                Assembly for Wales provided an update on the Council’s work on
                social inclusion. Recognising that there are strong
                commonalities across the British-Irish Council areas, proposals
                included a community conference to promote sharing of good
                practice on particular aspects of social inclusion. The
                British-Irish Council web site will shortly launch a section on
                social inclusion. That will promote community networking and
                will engage with communities on the British-Irish Council’s
                programme of work on social inclusion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A report has already been made to the
                Assembly on the inaugural transport sector meeting, held in
                Belfast on 19 December 2000 under the joint chairmanship of the
                First Minister and the then Deputy First Minister.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At that meeting there was a wide-ranging
                debate on the discussion paper prepared by the Northern Ireland
                Executive, and agreement was reached on the need for an
                integrated and sustainable approach to transport issues that
                would take account of the relevant economic, social and
                environmental issues.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition, a range of key issues were
                identified that will inform future work. They included the
                problems of peripherality, road safety, regional air links,
                transport in rural areas, exchanges of information, experiences
                in areas such as public-private partnerships and links between
                transport and land-use planning. Existing and future strategies
                for dealing with integrated transport issues and policies were
                also noted.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council decided that the Northern Ireland
                Executive would convene an early meeting of senior officials to
                examine an agreed menu of options and prepare detailed
                recommendations for work in several initial priority areas.
                Recommendations will then be submitted to a further meeting for
                approval.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In November 2000, Jersey chaired a
                wide-ranging discussion on the knowledge economy, and several
                further useful discussions have been held since. A key issue
                that has been identified is the problem of a lack of information
                technology skills among significant groups of people, especially
                in remoter areas. The digital divide is seen as a central
                problem which acts as a barrier to a range of strategies to
                increase social inclusion. Jersey is establishing a project to
                map and analyse member Administrations’ initiatives to improve
                access to the Internet and to ensure that the bulk of the
                population can readily acquire computing skills. To take that
                work forward, Jersey will host a major conference for decision
                makers, Bridging the Digital Divide, in April 2002.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In consultation with other member
                Administrations, Jersey, along with the British-Irish Council’s
                secretariat, has taken the lead in designing the Council’s web
                site. In the first instance, the aim is to create a public
                showcase for the work of the British-Irish Council that will be
                launched in spring 2002.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council agreed that Guernsey will do work
                on tourism while the Isle of Man will take the lead in health,
                with a focus on the application of telemedicine. The Council
                also heard proposals to improve the workings of the
                British-Irish Council and agreed that each member Administration
                and the Council will consider them further.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council agreed that Jersey will host the
                next summit in April 2002 and that the meeting will focus on the
                knowledge economy. Scotland and Wales will host a summit in
                September 2002, and Northern Ireland will host one early in
                2003. A copy of the communiqué issued following the meeting has
                been placed in the Assembly Library.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Deputy First Minister agree that
                there should be more activity in the British-Irish Council than
                has been the case to date?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive and I agree that there needs to
                be much more activity in the British-Irish Council. That was
                only the second summit meeting. Owing to political difficulties,
                we were unable to hold summit meetings earlier, and we have been
                unable to follow through on the sectoral meetings in the way
                that was planned. The meeting on 30 November was businesslike,
                and people discussed drugs issues. Many of the member
                Administrations found the meeting worthwhile and a useful model
                for ongoing work in the British-Irish Council. That proves that
                the Council can work in an organic and effective way that helps
                and reflects the interests of the member Administrations.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I said, the importance of targeting the
                assets of criminals engaged in drug trafficking was widely
                acknowledged. The Irish Government took the opportunity to
                explain the background to the establishment and operation of the
                Criminal Assets Bureau in Ireland. The bureau has had
                significant success in targeting the assets of drug barons. Many
                of the Administrations had questions on this, and useful ideas
                were exchanged.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. The
                Deputy First Minister has pointed to the benefits to everyone of
                exchanging information. I welcome the reference to Sellafield,
                although I note the absence of any information on the response
                of the British Government. I am certain that the other
                Assemblies and Parliaments that were represented at the meeting
                expressed widespread concerns.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">References to information technology and the
                knowledge economy are recurring themes, and that is to be
                welcomed. Will the Deputy First Minister comment on the
                importance to the economy of extending broadband technology
                throughout the region and say whether this was recognised in the
                discussions? This area of the economy is led by the private
                sector, and that approach is inadequate because the area west of
                the River Bann will lag behind areas around the Greater Belfast
                conurbation.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was happy to reflect the fact that all
                parties in the Assembly had expressed concerns about Sellafield.
                Concerns were also expressed by people on both sides of the
                border of this island. The British Government seemed to
                acknowledge those concerns, but it is not the first time that
                they have done so. The concerns were substantiated further by
                the court case. I hope that we will receive better information
                and that we will be more directly in the loop on these issues in
                the future. The British-Irish Council will address the issue
                again in the environment sectoral meeting, so we will be
                involved as a participating Administration.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The importance of the knowledge economy is
                emphasised in the Programme for Government. It is of huge
                importance to the region, because it is where the path to
                competitiveness lies. It is important that the matter be
                addressed by the British-Irish Council, and the Administration
                in Jersey are doing useful work on drawing together proposals
                from the other Administrations.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the fact that the Deputy First
                Minister has drawn attention to the Sellafield problem. However,
                both authorities on this island have expressed enormous concern,
                and the Prime Minister, Tony Blair, has provided a scant
                response, determined to press on with further development there.
                If Mr Blair is not prepared to deal with this potential time
                bomb and sitting target, is it worth having a British-Irish
                Council?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yes. The fact that we were able to address an
                issue such as drugs in the useful and practical way that we did
                demonstrates the value of the British-Irish Council. Its value
                will be underscored by the useful work that will flow from it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The same also applies in other sectors. The
                issue of Sellafield is a vexed one. However, the British-Irish
                Council gives the various Administrations who share these
                islands an avenue through which to deal with such issues.
                Without the British-Irish Council, what forum would the
                Administrations have to raise those issues? What sectoral format
                would exist to allow them to take the lead in examining the
                issue of radioactive waste from Sellafield? The value of the
                British-Irish Council is that it provides a forum in which
                concerns can be raised, and in which the British Government can
                offer reassurance if they so wish.</p>

                how important tourism is for us and that we can make up ground
                in that area. We have usefully addressed that issue on a
                North/South basis, mainly through the setting up of Tourism
                Ireland Ltd. It has worked directly with other tourism
                authorities in these islands and has examined the implications
                for tourism of the events of 11 September, not least the issue
                of air links. That is a matter that the Administrations who

                are taking the lead in addressing the issue, but other
                Administrations will also be involved. The British Government

                report on a welcome second plenary meeting of the British-Irish
                Council. The Minister referred to the Jersey Administration
                working alongside the British-Irish Council secretariat to
                construct a web site — again, that is welcome. Does he believe
                that the size of the secretariat is adequate, given that, when I
                was last apprised of its size, it comprised one employee in
                Whitehall and a part-time employee in Dublin? Do the Minister
                and the Executive feel that the secretariat is large enough to

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The arrangements for the secretariat are as
                provided for in the Good Friday Agreement, and responsibility
                for it falls to the British and Irish Governments. Given that
                due to circumstances, not many meetings have taken place, the
                size of the secretariat and the question of how active its role
                has been have not mattered very much.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The British-Irish Council meeting did hear
                some proposals to further consider the operation of the

                the issue, and that papers will issue in due course. The matter

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Much work aimed at bridging the digital
                divide is already under way in Departments here. The Department
                of Agriculture and Rural Development has established 19 access
                points across the region for farmers. The Department for
                Employment and Learning has created 32 learndirect centres
                throughout the region, aimed at providing citizens with the
                skills needed to access the digital world. That Department has
                also implemented the Electronic Libraries for Northern Ireland
                project, through which libraries will become information hubs
                for their communities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A number of other initiatives will be

                The Central Information and Technology Unit in our own
                Department will bring that forward for public consultation in
                2002. It will aim first to scope the problem and, secondly, to
                draw together the many current and planned initiatives, as well
                as proposing a way forward.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the issue of transport, the Deputy First
                Minister mentioned the transfer of information and experiences
                in public-private partnerships. Of course, in the South, as he
                will be well aware, such partnerships were an option of choice,
                whereas here in Northern Ireland they may be an option of
                necessity. He also said that existing and future strategies for
                dealing with integrated transport issues and policy were noted.
                Are we talking here about the inclusion of public-private
                partnerships within such strategies?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member has raised several points.
                Obviously, in looking at transport issues overall, the Council
                will want to look, not just at transport arrangements in the
                islands and between the different areas, but also at experience
                in each administrative area on more localised or regional
                transport issues. Clearly, the use of public-private
                partnerships in relation to key transport infrastructure is
                going to be a relevant area for exchange of information and best
                practice, and that will follow through. Obviously there are
                different approaches in the different Administrations, but that
                adds to the benefit and value of the British-Irish Council as a
                forum where we can look at the different practices and establish
                what is best practice for different types of projects, according
                to their scale or significance.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Regarding other transport issues and
                integrated strategies, it is again going to be a case of looking
                at different approaches in different areas. Further work is
                needed on that. The Northern Ireland Administration have agreed
                to take the lead on transport. However, it could well be that,
                as we get into discrete areas of transport, other
                Administrations will take the lead in looking at particular
                issues or aspects, such as we have seen in relation to the
                environment. We have seen other Administrations take the lead on
                specific issues that have emerged in that sector. We are looking
                forward to further development in the transport sector.</p>

                they had responsibility. It was clear that good progress was
                being made.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report includes a range of practical
                initiatives, such as the launch of the equity network programme
                by InterTradeIreland. That was designed to promote the
                availability of venture capital to businesses in the North and
                South and to develop awareness of the potential of private
                equity investment to foster growth in private enterprises,
                particularly in the small and medium-sized enterprise (SME)
                sector. Another initiative is work in the health sector to
                consider the report of the acute hospitals review group in view
                of its suggestion of the potential to develop existing
                cross-border arrangements for the benefit of patients.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A third initiative involves work done in the
                agriculture sector to limit the spread of foot-and-mouth disease
                on the island of Ireland. That is now to be reinforced by an
                official steering group that will develop a strategy for the
                control of animal movements on the island, drawing on work done
                in both jurisdictions. That group will consider the means of
                prevention, containment and eradication of future epizootic
                disease outbreaks on the island. There is also work to develop a
                joint market development programme for recycled materials and
                goods to encourage and support the expansion of waste recycling
                on an all-island basis.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These are only four examples drawn from a
                much wider range of measures designed to secure mutual benefit
                for all. The Council looks forward to continuing progress being
                made in all areas of its remit.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Approval was given to a schedule of council
                meetings to take place over the coming months. That includes
                plans to hold a first meeting in the next few weeks in
                institutional format, involving the First Minister, myself, and
                Brian Cowen, the Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council noted a progress report on the
                work undertaken by a working group established to take forward a
                study on the establishment of an independent North/ South
                consultative forum. The Council agreed that this issue should be
                addressed at the forthcoming meeting in institutional format. A
                further progress report will be made at the next plenary.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council agreed to publish the report on a
                study on the obstacles to cross-border mobility on the island of
                Ireland. The two Administrations agreed that views would not be
                offered on the conclusions at this stage, pending publication
                and a process of consultation to give interested organisations,
                including Government Departments and individuals, the
                opportunity to present their views on the recommendations and
                their implementation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The steering group will remain in place to
                manage the consultation exercise. It will then present to the
                next plenary meeting a paper summarising, evaluating and costing
                the recommendations, and reaching conclusions relating to
                implementation proposals where appropriate. The Council also
                agreed that the steering group should ensure that in considering
                proposals, care should be taken to avoid both creating barriers
                to east-west mobility and creating unjustified advantage for
                cross- border workers beyond that available in the respective
                jurisdictions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council agreed an opinion on the budgets
                for the North/South bodies for the period 2002 to 04. It is
                envisaged that £54·37 million/92·07 million euro will be
                spent by the six bodies in 2002. The respective contributions
                from each Administration will be £40·01 million/67·74 million
                euro from the Irish Government and £14·37 million/24·33
                million euro from the devolved Administration.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On competitiveness, the Council received a
                report commissioned by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and
                Investment and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and
                Employment, working in conjunction with InterTradeIreland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report covered a broad spectrum of work
                in a range of administrative functions, and the Council
                requested that the relevant Government Departments and agencies
                pursue the competitiveness agenda to achieve mutual economic
                benefit in the areas for which they are responsible.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There was a useful exchange of information on
                key priorities in the Irish Government’s Programme for
                Prosperity and Fairness, the National Development Plan and
                specific sections of the Administration’s draft Programme for
                Government. The Council noted the position taken on each and
                welcomed the opportunity to discuss each document.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There was a useful exchange of views between
                Ministers from the North and the South on the impact of the 11
                September attacks in the United States. They discussed the
                economic impact of those horrific events, particularly their
                effect on tourism in both parts of the island. The Council noted
                that the tourism agencies on the island of Ireland are
                developing proposals to reduce the impact on the tourism
                industry. Emergency and contingency planning were discussed, and
                the need for continued cross-border co-operation on health
                issues, and for structures in each jurisdiction to plan for
                major incidents, was highlighted.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council agreed that its next plenary
                meeting would be held in Northern Ireland in May 2002. A copy of
                the communiqué issued after the meeting has been placed in the
                Assembly Library.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Can the Minister assure the Assembly that
                when addressing issues of North/South mobility, no action will
                be taken that would disadvantage people in Northern Ireland who
                wish to move between here and Great Britain?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council agreed that given that the
                steering group is carrying out a study of obstacles to mobility
                and that a consultation exercise is still to take place, care
                should be taken to ensure that the work does not result in any
                new barriers to east-west mobility. That is understood. There is
                also a need to ensure that nothing arises that would allow
                anyone to believe that they have been placed at an undue
                disadvantage in relation to others in their jurisdiction.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many North/South mobility issues apply
                equally to those moving from east to west. Some who move between
                east and west, between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, also
                seek to move between North and South. Useful work can be done
                that is not detrimental to anyone, and which contributes to the
                wider benefits for those moving between east and west.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How can the proposals on cross-border
                arrangements that are contained in the acute hospitals review
                group report be implemented, following their consideration by
                the North/South Ministerial Council?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Cross-border work has already been carried
                out. The Hayes Report, and many of the responses to it, have
                identified such co-operation as a relevant issue. Cross-border
                work has included that between health boards in the border area
                under the Co- operation and Working Together (CAWT) programme.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given that the review of acute hospital
                services is under consultation and that proposals are still to
                emerge, it would be wrong to specify what might happen on a
                cross-border level. At present, no more can be settled in regard
                to that issue than in relation to any other aspect of the acute
                hospitals review that arises in one jurisdiction. We are using
                the facilities of the North/South Ministerial Council to enhance
                co-operation and co- ordination to address those issues in a
                meaningful way. Therefore the cross-border issues will not be
                disregarded in the development of the review of acute hospital
                services.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Deputy First Minister for his
                statement. With your permission, Mr Speaker, I will make a brief
                comment and then ask a question. The Minister’s statement
                mentioned the health sector’s consideration of the report of
                the acute hospitals review group. At least four Members from the
                two communities would issue a health warning on that. The
                Minister’s statement described the health sector’s
                initiative to consider the report of the acute hospitals review
                group in view of its suggestion about the potential for
                developing existing cross-border arrangements. It is a pity that
                Hayes did not totally examine that matter when he came to his
                conclusions about hospital provision in the south-west.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The statement also deals with work done in
                the agriculture sector to limit the spread of foot-and-mouth
                disease. Will the Deputy First Minister advise the House what
                actions have been taken in the North/South Ministerial Council’s
                agriculture sector to control the spread of animal disease?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am sure that relevant others will note the
                observations and comments in the first part of Mr Hussey’s
                question. It is not for me to answer on the implications of the
                review of acute hospital services. However, regardless of how
                Members feel that the cross-border dimension was treated in the
                Hayes Report, the North/South Ministerial Council offers a
                relevant channel through which we can look at that, now that the
                review is the subject of further consultation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My statement covers some of the developments
                that are taking place in agriculture. It says that we are moving
                to ensure that there are strong and effective controls in place
                to deal with any episodic outbreaks that may occur, that agreed
                and reliable controls can be applied, particularly in relation
                to animal health, and that people island-wide will have
                confidence in the system. Much of that work will follow from the
                lessons that were successfully learnt when dealing with the
                foot-and-mouth disease outbreak.</p>

                Lights and transport, were discussed at the Council? What

                at the operation of the Council and reflect strongly on the
                successful areas. Some other areas have been underdeveloped, and
                we will need to consider how to improve their operation and
                development.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some of the issues with Irish Lights are not
                conducive to being dealt with on a North/South basis, and east-
                west issues are also involved. The Council must look at them
                again and come up with satisfactory arrangements for dealing
                with Irish Lights.</p>

                through some work that is not unrelated to the common chapter
                — for instance, the road from Larne right through to the
                border below Newry. However, we want to make sure that we have a
                more strategic approach than that. Therefore further proposals
                will be considered.</p>

                Cuirim fáilte roimh an ráiteas agus roimh an chruinniú. When
                will the annual report mentioned in the Deputy First Minister’s

                matter of the acute hospitals review group, will Micheál Martin’s
                10-year strategy document also be viewed in this context for its
                North/South potential?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, I ask the Minister to comment on
                whether these meetings take place too infrequently. Would
                quarterly meetings not be more practical and effective than six-
                monthly meetings?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall answer the Member’s last question
                first. We know of the obvious political difficulties there have
                been with the greater frequency and reliability of plenary and
                sectoral meetings. The most important issue is not the frequency
                of the meetings, rather that there is substantive and practical
                business to conduct, both for the plenary itself and in
                reflecting the work that is going on at sectoral level. The next
                plenary meeting is planned for May.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">More importantly, there are key meetings
                planned in the various sectoral formats. There is a work
                programme, which I referred to in my statement, agreed between
                now and then and, indeed, beyond. Rather than saying that there
                is one type of meeting that we have to have more of, the issue
                is that we have to have more of the meetings, in more of the
                formats, producing more benefits and producing more outcomes
                that are in everyone’s interest.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report should be published. If Members
                have not yet received it, it will not be long in winging its way
                to their pigeonholes.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I note with interest the reference to the
                national development plan by the Dublin Government. During a
                recent visit to the north-west, which included Derry, but not
                only Derry, local people and Derry City Council emphasised the
                importance of the national development plan and of taking the
                north-west region into account in the plan.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Was there much discussion about the national
                development plan? Was there any discussion about including the
                north-west in particular in the development of transportation
                links — not just road but also rail links — as this is an
                important and vital element to the development of that area?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The exchange that touched on the national
                development plan also reflected issues in the Programme for
                Government. It highlighted the fact that there is a common
                chapter between the national development plan in the South and
                the community support framework for Northern Ireland. That
                offers a facility for us to ensure some more concentrated
                co-operation in border areas, particularly in developments that
                would be common to and compatible with both the national
                development plan and the community support framework. The
                exchange that took place did not get down to the level of
                precise detail about transport sectors in particular regions or
                localities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Discussions were held to compare issues
                arising from both strategic plans, and it was agreed that
                additional targeted work, which could be followed up at the
                appropriate interdepartmental or sectoral level, would be
                worthwhile.</p>

                Departments, North and South, willing to work positively
                together on the eradication of animal disease? There was
                evidence of co-operation during the recent outbreak of
                foot-and-mouth disease. Will Departments have programmes and
                strategies in place in order to avoid situations such as we have
                had in the past? Brucellosis is a serious problem along the

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Animal health is an important issue that was
                well registered at the North/ South Ministerial Council meeting,
                as it has been throughout the agriculture sector. The Council’s
                discussions focused strongly on the lessons learnt on how to
                control foot-and-mouth disease. There were also discussions on
                the need to develop a strategy for the control of animal
                movements on the island, something which underpins good animal
                health.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The meeting considered other issues, such as
                the need to improve the competitive position of the pig sector
                throughout the island. The progress made by the steering group
                on cross-border rural development was also noted. More detailed
                work on those and other agriculture issues will continue to be

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Following nomination by the First Minister
                and the Deputy First Minister, Dermot Nesbitt and I attended the
                third meeting on education of the North/South Ministerial
                Council, which was held in sectoral format in the Berkley Court
                Hotel, Dublin, on 28 November 2001. The Irish Government were
                represented by Dr Michael Woods TD, Minister for Education and
                Science. This statement has been approved by Dermot Nesbitt and
                is also made on his behalf.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The objectives of the meeting were to
                consider the outcome of research on cross-border school, youth
                and teacher exchanges; to review the progress made by the joint
                working groups, which were established at the first sectoral
                meeting on 3 February 2000, on underachievement in education,
                special education needs and teachers’ qualifications; to
                consider several progress reports from the working groups and
                agree the priorities for their future work; and to make
                decisions on some specific actions, on which I shall elaborate
                later.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, the Council took note of the scoping
                study carried out by the Centre for Cross Border Studies in
                Armagh on the extent and effectiveness of existing school, youth
                and teacher exchange programmes. The study was commissioned at
                our meeting in July last year, and the report was completed in
                the autumn. Its findings and recommendations were considered by
                interested organisations at a consultative conference, which
                took place on 18 October in Armagh.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the report and the outcomes of
                the conference, the Council agreed that there was a need for
                suitable processes to improve the ways in which school, youth
                and teacher exchanges are managed and facilitated and to improve
                the quality of such exchanges for participants. Therefore, we
                have agreed in principle to establish an advisory standing
                committee on school, youth and teacher exchanges with
                representation from across the various stakeholder groups. At
                its next meeting, the Council will consider proposals for
                delivery mechanisms and the composition of the standing
                committee.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Special education, where the initial focus
                has been on autism and dyslexia, is an important area of the
                Council’s work. It took note of the progress report from the
                joint working group and agreed several specific actions. The
                Council is keen to promote dialogue and joint working between
                the professionals involved in that field, particularly at a
                strategic level. We wish to see the development of specialist
                programmes for teacher exchanges. In addition, the Council
                decided to fund the development of videos for the parents of
                children with autism and dyslexia and CD-ROMs for their
                teachers. The videos and CD-ROMs will provide advice and
                guidance for parents and teachers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council also considered a report from the
                teachers’ superannuation working group, which was set up to
                examine the feasibility and implications of establishing an
                agreement for the transfer on a North/South basis of the
                superannuation benefits of teachers who move between the
                jurisdictions to live and work. There is potential for agreement
                on this, and we agreed further work to be undertaken by the
                working group to progress the matter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report from the teachers’
                qualifications working group, which was established by the
                Council to examine a range of issues related to teacher
                mobility, was also considered. We welcomed the intention of
                teachers and education professionals, North and South, to
                collaborate on a range of issues of common interest.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council welcomed the greater flexibility
                in the requirements for proficiency in Irish for teaching posts
                in the South. It also noted that some steps have been taken that
                underpin the conclusions of the working group. Those include the
                Teacher’s Registration Council’s granting general
                recognition of several qualifications that are awarded by the
                University of Ulster. The Council also agreed further work to be
                undertaken by the working group.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In another key area, the Council again noted
                the report from the literacy and numeracy working group.
                Literacy and numeracy skills are vital to enable access to the
                rest of the curriculum. It is important to learn from one
                another as we develop our respective policies and strategies. We
                have shared our experiences of the reading recovery programme
                and the new materials that we have produced to help children
                improve their mathematics skills. The Council noted that the
                working group would be considering a recent evaluation of the
                reading recovery programme published by the University of
                Strathclyde. The working group will later present to the Council
                proposals for the development of the programme, together with
                proposals for the production of interactive training materials
                for literacy teachers. The Council agreed a further programme
                for the working group.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unless children attend school and are
                encouraged to remain there after the age of 16, they cannot
                achieve their full potential. The Council considered areas for
                co-operation to promote attendance and retention, and endorsed
                the joint working group’s proposals for the dissemination of
                good practice in that regard. The Council also agreed to run a
                home/school/community pilot project in the North, aimed at
                improving parental involvement in their children’s education.
                The project will draw on the considerable experience of similar
                programmes that operate in the South, such as those in north
                Dublin and Dundalk.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Children have a fundamental right to be safe
                and protected while in school and elsewhere, and to be free from
                the risk of abuse while in the care of teachers, youth leaders
                and others. The Council believes that the issue of child
                protection in these islands must be addressed. It noted the
                joint working group’s report on the matter. It has agreed that
                there is a need for confidential mechanisms, North and South, to
                register those teachers and other education workers who are
                regarded as being unsuitable to work with children and young
                people. The Council recognised that the issue is a complex one;
                it agreed that all jurisdictions must collaborate to reach an
                effective solution and that appropriate legislation will be
                required. My Colleague Bairbre de Brún has published a
                consultation document on legislative proposals to place existing
                pre-employment checks on a statutory footing. We will also
                create mechanisms to provide adequate safeguards for our
                children. Any proposal on our part would require separate but
                complementary legislation, North and South.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council welcomed the availability of over
                five million euros under measure 5.5 of Peace II to promote
                school and youth co-operation. Officials in both Departments
                have been working closely to establish the necessary
                administrative procedures to enable joint bids under that
                measure to be made by the two Departments of Education for
                cross-border projects.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Council agreed the text of a communiqué
                that was issued after the meeting, and a copy has been placed in
                the Assembly Library. The next meeting of the Council is planned
                for April 2002. I look forward to returning to the Assembly with
                a further progress report at that time.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the Minister’s statement.
                However, I am concerned about the right of children to be safe

                environment free from disruptive behaviour. Will future

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At present, discipline does not come under
                the remit of the education sector of the North/South Ministerial
                Council. However, the potential for developing that was evident
                in the Programme for Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The education sector will consider school
                discipline, and steps have already been taken in the North to
                deal with the issue. The Council understands the pressures and
                stresses that the difficult issue of discipline creates for
                teachers. I am willing to explore the issue more fully with our
                colleagues in the South.</p>

                the work that has been done, both in Dublin and in Dundalk. We
                are proceeding with haste because the project will bring
                considerable value to us all. There is an increasing recognition
                on the island that the connections between home and school, and
                between community and school, are vital. We have learnt that
                lesson in the North. It is too early to say what areas will be

                Cuirim fáilte roimh an ráiteas seo. I welcome the Minister’s
                statement, which was one of the more comprehensive North/South
                Ministerial Council sectoral meeting statements that have been
                made in the House. I look forward to progress reports from the
                advisory standing committee on school, youth and teacher
                exchanges as work continues in those areas. Can the Minister
                detail his plans to encourage the promotion of literacy and
                numeracy in schools both North and South? Are the sectoral
                meetings held frequently enough to be effective and practical?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr M McGuinness:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several Members mentioned the frequency of
                the meetings. It is important to meet regularly to ensure that
                the work that occurs between meetings — and, in our case, with
                the working groups that have been established between the two
                Departments — is progressing to our satisfaction. I am pleased
                with the work carried out by the working groups.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Everybody knows that literacy and numeracy
                are the keys to the rest of the curriculum and other areas of
                learning. It is important to consider how North and South can
                best co-operate to ensure that we learn from each other as we
                take forward our respective policies and strategies. The
                literacy and numeracy group recognises the benefits of
                exchanging documents and other materials relating to the
                promotion of literacy and numeracy in schools.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The group also recognises the benefits of key
                personnel, North and South, attending relevant conferences and
                seminars on existing or new developments in the other
                jurisdiction. That has already led to the attendance of teachers
                at key training events, including summer schools. A strategic
                approach will be considered for future events. Arrangements have
                been established, North and South, to secure the exchange of
                materials and the notification of events.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Two initiatives are already operating on a
                cross-border basis. One is the Pushkin Prizes, which encourage
                creative writing among young people. It is not only young people
                who are being encouraged. On Friday, I attended the launch in
                Derry of an anthology of work by teachers from all over the
                island. It was most encouraging to see people at the chalk face
                of education being keenly involved in releasing children’s
                imagination, and unlocking their own creativity and that of the
                children.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The other initiative is the Children’s
                Books Ireland research project, which will provide valuable
                information on children’s reading habits and will inform
                future policy decisions. Those two schemes are exciting
                innovations that can be built on in the future.</p>

                Committee, received the information on the statement only today?
                That is despite the fact that such subjects as underachievement
                and special educational needs have been included in our work
                programme. I have mentioned such overlapping previously. Has any
                consideration been given to creating a system that would

                would be improper for the Minister to make statements to
                Committees on the outcome of North/South Ministerial plenary
                meetings or other meetings before bringing them to the House. Of

                to engage in discussion with the relevant Committee — any
                Minister may do so. Nonetheless, I must say that it is important
                that Ministers do the House the courtesy of making statements in
                the House. The Minister is doing that, as his Colleagues have
                done. It would not be proper to make the statements elsewhere
                — in Committee or outside the House. The House must appreciate
                what Ministers are doing.</p>

                said that the Council &quot;decided to fund the development of
                videos for the parents&quot;. Who will develop those videos, and
                how will they be distributed?</p>

                have been produced. Are copies of those materials readily
                available to teachers in Northern Ireland, and are they
                compatible with the Northern Ireland curriculum?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Member for those three questions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is vital that we provide as much
                information as possible to parents and teachers, and the videos
                and CD-ROMs will be important aids in doing that. The special
                educational needs working parties have a duty to provide us with
                progress reports on their work. In many ways, we depend on
                receiving that information before decisions can be taken.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must all share details of good practice,
                and North and South must learn from each other. The
                establishment of the working parties has been an important
                development. They have done much good work, building on the good
                work done by officials from both Departments of Education long
                before the Good Friday Agreement. We are learning all the time,
                and we are keen to see that the working parties produce
                materials that are consistent with the education that we
                provide, in the South as well as in the North.</p>

                comprehensive nature of the report on North/South education
                co-operation, particularly in those areas that have caused
                teachers great frustration for many years. I welcome the five

                of school and youth co-operation. I encourage the Minister to

                time for completion of the application and selection process, it
                is anticipated that the funding should be available to the
                successful projects before the end of March 2002. The sum of
                5·3 million euros is a considerable amount of money. The
                Department wants people to come forward with innovative schemes
                and approaches to build on the good work that has been done
                recently.</p>

                Agreement, in particular, more people have been travelling
                between the North and the South. That is vital and valuable. It
                makes a worthwhile contribution to increasing pupils’ and
                teachers’ understanding of important issues.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members know that many of these different
                contacts were conducted on a one-to-one basis, and the good work
                of bodies such as Co-operation Ireland made an immense
                contribution to increasing understanding. However, as the
                Council has established an advisory standing committee on
                school, youth and teacher exchanges, we can look forward to a
                much more cohesive and co-ordinated approach to the work. It is
                exciting, and the atmosphere is conducive to our work. This work
                will benefit community relations, both in the North and
                throughout the island of Ireland, and that is essential. There
                are clear and encouraging signals that educationalists of all
                descriptions — North and South — appreciate the importance
                of movement between the northern and southern jurisdictions and
                the formulation of schemes that can bring people together.</p>

                when a teacher is to be included on a payroll for the first
                time. We are trying to put a mechanism in place that will allow

                recognise the importance of contact with England, Scotland and
                Wales. I also suggest that we establish contact with education

                The Republic of Ireland also needs additional teachers, so is it
                not absurd that we have not achieved full and mutual recognition
                of teachers’ qualifications on both sides of the border? Will

                for teachers and to ensure maximum mobility across the island.
                We and the working groups are challenged to do that. I am very
                confident that the Member’s concerns about teachers’
                qualifications and the mobility of teachers can be resolved

                language proficiency requirements for teaching posts in the

                subjects, or for specific posts only?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In response to a question for oral answer on
                25 September 2000, the Minister gave a commitment to provide the
                Committee for Education with a summary of the issues discussed
                at each education sectoral meeting of the North/South
                Ministerial Council. Will he fulfil that commitment, and when

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member’s second question relates to a
                point made by Mrs E Bell. I wish to advise the House that, like
                all Ministers who attend North/ South Ministerial Council
                meetings, I am bound by the rules that have been established by
                the Executive and the Assembly. In following those procedures, I
                am more than willing to ensure that, after we have reported to
                the House, the Committee for Education receives as full a report
                as possible on the business that was conducted at a sectoral
                meeting.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The requirement for proficiency in the Irish
                language is now limited to teachers in primary schools and
                secondary level teachers in Gaeltacht schools, or teachers who
                are required to teach through the medium of Irish. In addition,
                individuals are now afforded a five-year period in which to
                satisfy the requirement for proficiency in Irish and, of course,
                the differential rates of pay will end, pending the acquisition
                of a certificate. The authorities in the South are addressing
                this matter, and we are keen to ensure that every encouragement
                is given to ensure a proper mobility of teachers between North
                and South.</p>

                has mentioned children’s right to be free from the risk of
                abuse while in schools or in teachers’ care. What impact will

                proposed Protection of Children and Vulnerable Adults Bill have

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My officials have worked closely with
                Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety
                officials on the proposals for the Protection of Children and
                Vulnerable Adults Bill, and consultation is ongoing. The
                comprehensive proposals are intended to cover those who work
                with children, including teachers and others employed in
                education. The main proposal is to establish a statutory list of
                people who are unsuitable to work with children. As far as
                employees in education are concerned, that will not dispense
                with the need to carry out a criminal records check on each
                teacher or employee. As indicated in the consultation paper, the
                Bill will create a broad equivalent to the Protection of
                Children Act 1999 and part 7 of the Care Standards Act 2000 in
                England and Wales. Through the Bill, and mirroring the approach
                adopted in the Protection of Children Act 1999, the Department
                of Education proposes amending the regulatory powers contained
                in the Department’s primary legislation to allow the
                Department to draw up regulations to strengthen specific
                safeguards in the education sector where appropriate. The
                drafting of any such regulations will involve separate
                consultation in due course.</p>

                thank the Minister for his positive report, which we welcome. We
                are pleased to note the progress on the various joint working
                groups, particularly those dealing with autism, literacy and
                numeracy, and the teachers’ superannuation working group,
                which I trust will focus on the important issue not only of
                cross-border qualifications, but of benefits harmonisation. Can
                the Minister elaborate on the purpose of the superannuation
                working group and the options that it is considering?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr M McGuinness:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At present a teacher moving to take up a job
                in either the North or the South cannot add his previous service
                to his new employment for the purpose of calculating pension
                benefits. This is an obstacle to mobility, and its removal would
                benefit all teachers, North and South.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The options being considered revolve around
                the central difficulties that many teachers face. In examining
                the possible alternatives the working group has indicated that
                it aims to ensure that teachers moving between the
                jurisdictions, with the consequent transfer of accrued pension
                rights, will be awarded benefits in the receiving scheme broadly
                equivalent in value to the benefits that would have been
                received in the surrendering scheme. This approach will prove
                equitable and will address the need to ensure that the
                arrangements finally agreed are not more favourable in one or
                other of the jurisdictions otherwise teachers would be
                encouraged simply to take advantage of the more favourable
                terms.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Speaker. I want to
                raise a matter about the indicative timings shown on the
                monitors. You will be aware, and will appreciate, that many
                Members use the monitors to find out when statements will be
                made or when Assembly business will take place. Having had to
                undertake duties outside the House this morning, I read the
                monitor, which indicated that the Minister’s statement would
                be made shortly after 1.00 pm. Clearly that is not going to
                happen. I missed the statement and have been unable to ask
                relevant questions. I ask you to consider the indicative timings
                that appear on the monitors.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are a number of issues. The question of
                indicative timings has raised itself again and again. Indicative
                timings are nothing more than that. They were actually meant to
                give the Whips — not the Members — some kind of guidance.
                The difficulty is that people treat them as if they are Holy
                Writ and imagine that business will operate according to them.
                If the indicative timings are on paper, business will almost
                certainly not operate to them — it never does, and that has
                been increasingly so in recent weeks.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member raises the question of matters on
                the monitors, and I will look into that. If they are being
                displayed on the monitor in a way that is misleading to Members,
                that is exceedingly unhelpful and is something that must be
                looked at.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are two ways in which ministerial
                statements can be treated as far as our business is concerned.
                One is the way in which we have treated them until now, which is
                that, insofar as possible, they are taken as the first items of
                business on the day, and there can be up to an hour for
                questions on them. If there is less, we move onto the next item
                of business. That can sometimes be difficult for Ministers,
                because they may find that previous Ministers do not provoke as
                many questions as were thought, and that they, therefore, have
                to rush back to the House. Since the outset, the Assembly has
                operated in that way — the House moves immediately to the next
                item of business, and ministerial statements are taken first.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is another way that we could operate;
                we could give a time in the way that is described by the Member.
                We could say that a ministerial statement will take place at a
                convenient time after a particular point on the clock — for
                example, a convenient time after 1.00 pm. The Member must,
                however, realise that if a matter is in process at that stage,
                that matter must then proceed to its conclusion. For example, if
                the Programme for Government debate today were to start at 12.45
                pm, it would then continue for some hours. The first possible
                convenient time after 1.00 pm would be after Question Time at
                4.00 pm. I am not sure whether that would actually convenience
                the Member more. However, whatever arrangement we have, we must
                operate to that arrangement, otherwise no one will know where
                they are.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If it is the case that the monitors are
                misleading in the way that they have described something, then
                something must be done about that. I undertake, to the Member
                and to the House, to look into that matter.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Speaker. You will be
                aware that there is crucial business running parallel to the
                functioning of the Assembly, in which Members are expected to
                participate. I am talking about Committees. You will also be
                aware that ministerial statements were available this morning
                and that Members had an opportunity to read them and digest the
                contents, yet critical, important business relating to
                constituents could not be asked of the Ministers. That was
                because the relevant Members — in this case me — were not
                present during the reading of the statement. Do you accept that
                that is unfair towards my constituents? They could not have
                their questions answered.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order. I do not think anything of the sort.
                There are matters of common courtesy here. If we expect
                Ministers to come and do the House the courtesy of making their
                statements, then we should expect Members to be here if they
                want to ask a question — at least in some part of the
                statement. Otherwise, we could have a situation, as happened in
                another place, where Ministers started to make their statements
                outside of the House. On those occasions, the Speaker said to
                the relevant Minister &quot;Fine. If it is made outside of the
                House you do not need to make it again here. We will take it as
                read into Hansard and move straight to the questions.&quot;
                However, there is a question of proper courtesy to the House.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member raises the question of Committees
                choosing to meet during the time of the plenary. The time of the
                plenary is absolutely clear. The Standing Orders make it clear
                that the appropriate time for the plenary is on Monday and
                Tuesday, and the appropriate time for Committees is Wednesday,
                Thursday and Friday. If Committees choose to meet during the
                proper time of the plenary, they are perfectly at liberty to do
                so — but they cannot then make demands as to how matters will
                be conducted in the plenary. If the Member is not in a position
                to ask questions for his constituents because he was elsewhere,
                that is a matter for himself.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is not something that I have simply
                dreamt up. It was fully consulted on through the usual channels.
                There was a general feeling that too many Members were touring
                into the Chamber and asking questions which had nothing to do
                with the statement, and that they had not done the House and the
                Minister the courtesy of being available for the statement. If
                the Member on this occasion has been caught in that, then that
                is unfortunate. I do not say that he is the major offender in
                respect of those other misdemeanours, but there is no point in
                my saying that it can be fish for one and flesh for another. All
                Members must fall under the same rubric.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member has done the House the service of
                bringing the matter not just to the attention of the Business
                Committee but to the attention of the House as a whole. It is
                now placed in Hansard for everyone’s edification and
                education.</p>

                occasion. I was somewhat surprised shortly afterwards to receive

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is clearly a matter that not only gave
                the student that he supervised in 1997 cause for concern, but
                with which the professor himself remains concerned.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;I have no personal axe to grind
                regarding Irish hare as a quarry species. It is neither widely
                shot nor coursed. However the population is vulnerable and it is
                difficult to reconcile the need for conservation measures with
                permission to take hares for sport.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is the view of the most appropriately

                — the professor of animal ecology.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This should be taken in conjunction with the
                ‘Northern Ireland Species Action Plans’, that I referred to
                last time, which the Minister’s Department has not yet taken

                </font><font SIZE="3">

                Heritage Service (EHS) and Department of the Environment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not propose to speak on this amendment
                in as much detail as I did last time, but the position is clear.
                We have a species action plan for the hare, but the Department
                is not implementing it. We have heard the professor of animal
                ecology express concern about any threat to hare numbers. We
                also have a Minister who has told the Committee on a number of
                occasions over the last year that as the law currently stands,
                he cannot refuse to issue a license to take hares for coursing.
                If that is the situation — if the Minister is genuinely
                concerned and if his Department proposes to take action as set
                out in its own species action plan — then the position is
                clear. The Minister should welcome this amendment with open
                arms, because it gives him the power to refuse licenses to take
                hares for coursing until it is established that the species is
                not under threat. It is as simple as that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister has said that he has not got the
                power, and that he therefore cannot respond to concerns
                expressed by the Committee on numerous occasions in the last
                year. This amendment gives him that power. It simply makes it
                clear that no license should be issued to take hares for
                coursing unless it is established that it would not endanger
                hare populations in Northern Ireland or any part thereof. I
                trust, therefore, that since this amendment is assisting the
                Minister in the concerns that he has expressed to the Committee
                over a great period of time, he will accept it in the spirit in
                which it is made. We will then ensure that the Bill is amended
                in this appropriate way.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for
                the Environment (Ms Hanna):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the Deputy Chairperson of the Committee
                for the Environment, I want to remind the House that the
                Committee has, for over 12 months, been questioning and opposing
                the Department of the Environment’s practice of issuing
                licenses for the capture of live hares for hare coursing. The
                Committee continues to have serious concerns about the
                acknowledged decreasing hare population throughout Northern
                Ireland. Prof Montgomery’s recent letter to the Committee
                confirms that the hare population is vulnerable and questions
                the permission to take hares for sport.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the amendment to the Bill before the
                House today was not considered by the Committee during its
                consideration of the Bill, so as Deputy Chairperson, I cannot
                speak on the Committee’s views on it. However, as a Member, I
                fully support the amendment, because it would make it unlawful
                to net hares for coursing if the taking of hares would endanger
                the hare population in Northern Ireland or any part thereof.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of the Environment (Mr Foster):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Mr Ford and Ms Hanna for their
                statements on the protection of hares. This subject had a
                respectable airing at the last meeting. It was discussed fully.
                I am concerned about the endangered species, but the figures
                given last time suggested that there is no great danger to hares
                from the coursing we have at present. The habitat of hares is
                the biggest problem, not just the coursing. The amendment tabled
                by Mr Ford, Mr McCarthy and Mr McLaughlin proposes to amend
                section 7D of The Game Preservation Act (Northern Ireland) 1928
                to ensure that in granting permits to take hares from the wild,
                the Department is satisfied that this will not endanger the hare
                population in Northern Ireland or any specific area of it. Even
                if we were to take this literally, we would not be able to find
                out how many hares there are in any particular area. We do not
                believe that there is any scarcity of hares in Northern Ireland
                as a whole.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This amendment will not make any significant
                contribution to protecting Irish hares, particularly when the
                ecological evidence shows that the main factor limiting the hare
                population is the availability of quality habitat, and that is
                the issue. This matter received a full airing during the debate
                at the Consideration Stage of the Bill, and I reiterate the
                views I expressed then. I am aware of the need to keep the hare
                population under review and have already detailed to the
                Assembly the measures I propose to take. These include the
                development of a species action plan for Irish hares as part of
                the wider biodiversity process and will include a repeat survey
                of the numbers of hares here. My Department already knows the
                approximate number, but we do not have detailed information on
                hares in any particular part.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr McClelland] in the
                Chair)</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Were this amendment to succeed, my Department
                would have to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that any
                local population would not be endangered, however that might be
                defined. That information could only be obtained at
                disproportionate cost. It would also place an unreasonable
                statutory duty on my Department, with no proven gain to the
                conservation status of the hare.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, if the amendment is aimed at hare
                coursing, it will not prevent the practice, since the majority
                of hares used for coursing here are brought from outside
                Northern Ireland, and we should note that. These issues were
                discussed thoroughly by the Assembly after Mr Ford’s and Mrs
                Bell’s amendments were tabled at Consideration Stage. The
                Assembly did not accept the need for Mr Ford’s various
                amendments at that time, and circumstances have not changed
                since.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ford mentioned Prof Montgomery. The
                professor is only stating an opinion. There is no further data
                on which this opinion depends, and we have nothing definite to
                confirm what Mr Ford has said. Consequently, I am not prepared
                to accept the amendment proposed by Mr Ford, Mr McCarthy and Mr
                McLaughlin to Clause 1 of the Bill.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ford:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If I was not confused before, I am most
                certainly confused now. The Minister said this morning that the
                Department does not believe that there is any great danger to
                hares. He also said that he does not have detailed information.
                Does that not prove the point of this amendment? The Department
                does not know what the situation is, but thinks that everything
                is OK. We are expected to believe the Minister rather than Prof
                Montgomery. I am sorry, but if it comes to the detailed ecology
                of Irish hares, I would sooner believe Prof Montgomery than the
                Minister and his civil servants.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Indeed, the Minister has just said that Prof
                Montgomery was only expressing an opinion. I shall repeat a
                point from Prof Montgomery’s letter that I made earlier:</p>

                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is not an opinion. That is a statement
                of fact, from a person who appears to know significantly more
                about the issue than the civil servants who so badly advised the
                Minister. The Minister’s response is proof that the amendment
                is clearly needed. The House should make the amendment.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That this Assembly endorses the Programme for

                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am pleased to present, on behalf of the
                First Minister and the Executive as a whole, this Programme for
                Government to the Assembly for approval.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey and Mr Mallon first presented
                the Programme for Government to the Assembly in draft form for
                consideration on 24 September. At the same time, a wider
                consultation process was launched on our proposed priorities and
                actions as set out in the draft programme and in our resource
                allocation plans contained in the draft Budget. We have now
                reached the end of that period of scrutiny within the Assembly,
                and of wider consultation, and have revisited the Programme for
                Government in the light of the points made in the Chamber, in
                Committees and elsewhere. Last week we presented the Assembly
                with a revised Programme for Government for its approval. Today
                provides an opportunity for the Assembly to debate and endorse
                this programme.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to focus on the importance of the
                consultation to the development of the Programme for Government,
                on the work that the programme sets for us and on the role of
                the programme. Before I do that, however, it would be helpful to
                Members for me to explain how the Programme for Government has
                evolved and developed since we presented the first draft
                programme to the Assembly in October 2000.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In this, the second year of the Programme for
                Government, we have been working to develop our approach to
                planning. We have defined clearly the policy issues that face us
                and focused our public services agreements on outputs and
                outcomes. We are in the process of identifying the actions
                required to deliver these outcomes in new service delivery
                agreements. Each Department should by now have provided a draft
                service delivery agreement to its Committee for consideration.
                We are keen to have the views of the Committees on the progress
                made to date and on areas for improvement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Within the programme, we have also refined
                our priorities. Following last year’s consultation we have,
                for example, given a much better focus to social matters,
                including that of the treatment of older people. The issue of
                housing and its important contribution receives a more
                significant description in this text. Of even greater
                significance, we have started work to tackle the issue of
                community division, seeking to integrate this more clearly into
                our process, preparing for the outcome of our review on
                community relations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Programme for Government cannot be, and
                is not, developed in a vacuum. Its development is influenced by
                a wide range of factors, including many that lie beyond the
                control of the devolved Administration. The Programme for
                Government sets out how we will work to make a difference to
                society. However, the priorities and policies it contains are
                shaped by the society and the world in which we live. They
                reflect, for example, the current economic conditions we face.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Over recent years our economic performance as
                a region has been strong, with several key indicators
                consistently performing well. Our employment growth, for
                example, has been at a much faster rate than Scotland and Wales,
                and we were outperformed only by London and the south-east. We
                have seen a 35·7% increase in manufacturing output over the
                last six years, compared with a UK average of 4·1%, and a
                dramatic improvement of 36% in labour productivity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A key challenge for the Executive will be to
                build on those successes, and the Programme for Government
                restates our commitment to securing a competitive and
                sustainable economy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The events of 11 September and their
                aftermath present a real challenge. The severity and duration of
                their impact on the global economy is still uncertain. However,
                although some impact has already been felt in the aviation and
                tourism industries, there is evidence that Northern Ireland
                should be able to weather an economic downturn. The relative
                importance of the public sector and, in particular, the buoyancy
                of the local labour market should stand us in good stead. In
                delivering the Programme for Government, the Executive will work
                in partnership with business and the trade unions to ensure that
                the prospects for growth are realised.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Economic factors influence, and are
                influenced by, social conditions. Too many people depend on
                benefits. For example, almost 18% of children under 16 years of
                age live in homes that are in receipt of income support. Our
                health record is not good either. Our life expectancy compares
                unfavourably with the European average, and there are huge
                differences in health status between the best off and worst off.
                It is vital that our priorities and policies respond to those
                social conditions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The development of the Programme for
                Government will also be influenced by another important factor
                — the work that is under way in the Treasury in preparation
                for the spending review in 2002. That is the next major spending
                review, which will set out our expenditure limits for the three
                years from April 2003.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Turning to the consultation process, a key
                piece of feedback that we received from the experience of
                developing the first Programme for Government last year was that
                more needed to be done to encourage and facilitate engagement in
                the process. That includes engagement with the Assembly, with
                our social partners and with the public. Engagement happens only
                if people believe that it is a two-way process, and that their
                views and suggestions will be listened to and considered. These
                days much is heard about &quot;consultation fatigue&quot;, and
                many consultation exercises are under way. However, it is
                important that we in Government hear not only the views of those
                involved in the delivery of public services but also the views
                of the public who receive and depend on those services. It is
                important that the views of people help the Executive and the
                Assembly to make a difference, and that all responses are
                considered carefully.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I reassure Members and others that the
                Executive take their views and suggestions seriously, and that
                in turn they influence our thinking. The Programme for
                Government is a single document on which the Executive consult.
                It is significant because it is the context within which all
                other public policies are developed and implemented. It is well
                worth engaging with the Executive on its development, and we are
                ready to listen and respond.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With that in mind, we made several changes to
                our consultation arrangements this year to facilitate a wider
                debate on our plans and priorities, and on the resource
                allocations that are required to support them. We began the
                process as long ago as June, when we presented the Executive’s
                position report on the Programme for Government and the Budget
                to the Assembly. That drew out many of the main features of the
                programme and its resource implications and equality aspects. It
                provided a structured starting point for discussions in the
                Assembly and beyond. We built on that during the consultation
                period. As well as circulating the draft Programme for
                Government widely, we organised a series of seminars that
                allowed for debate on the draft programme and the draft Budget.
                That included events in Armagh, Antrim and Derry that involved
                local councils and their social partners. We were also
                represented at an event arranged by organisations representing
                older people to consider the draft programme. Those seminars
                provided us with an opportunity to discuss and listen to views
                on the equality aspects of the Programme for Government and on
                our approach to assessing the equality impact of the policies
                that are set out in it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We also received detailed and constructive
                responses from Assembly Committees and from many organisations
                and individuals. We had the opportunity to listen to the views
                of Members in the debate that took place on 13 November.
                Together, those contributions helped to shape the programme that
                we have presented to the Assembly for approval.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of course, it has not been possible to
                include every suggestion that we received. Many proposals that
                were put forward during the consultation will require further,
                more detailed thought. Some have significant resource
                implications. However, I reassure all those who contributed to
                the process that the shelf life of their responses goes beyond
                the closing date for the consultation. The ideas and suggestions
                in those responses must be considered by Ministers and their
                Departments to ensure that the future development of the
                programme and the policies that it contains are well informed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Consultation means hearing what people agree
                with, as much as hearing what they disagree with or would like
                to see more of. The Executive were pleased with the level of
                support — in the Assembly and in the wider public — for
                their priorities and sub-priorities. We also welcome the support
                for our work in developing public service agreements and setting
                targets, and for our commitment to reporting publicly each year
                on progress towards implementing our Programme for Government
                commitments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive have also considered areas in
                which it was felt that we could do better. We have set out more
                clearly the steps that we will take to support older people. A
                key concern that emerged through the consultation was that we
                should do more to support older people, including the provision
                of free nursing care. We have now been able to respond
                positively, and, as I explained in the Budget statement, the
                programme has now been changed to include a commitment to
                introducing free nursing care for the residents of nursing homes
                from October 2002.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The programme also commits us to providing
                many more community care packages than we had planned in
                September. The Executive will now deliver an additional 1,000
                fully funded community care packages, targeted mainly at older
                people. Those packages will not only provide support for some of
                those most in need, but also, in many cases, help to obviate the
                need for hospital treatment. In other cases, they will allow
                people to return home from hospital much earlier.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The programme also restates our intention to
                modernise and improve hospital and primary care services. It
                commits us to new measures that will deliver better health and
                social care. Since September, we have considered, in the light
                of the consultation, what more we might do to improve services
                for those suffering from cancer, heart disease and renal
                failure. The Programme for Government now commits us to
                improving access to cardiac surgery, strengthening treatment
                processes for cancer sufferers and providing additional dialysis
                sessions for those with renal failure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive have also set out more clearly
                how the new agency, Invest Northern Ireland, which will be
                established in April 2002, will help deliver our goal of
                promoting entrepreneurship, innovation and creativity. We have
                highlighted new actions to improve our energy infrastructure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have outlined the main changes made since
                September. We must also remember that the Programme for
                Government contains many other important commitments that
                demonstrate our determination to work together to identify and
                develop approaches that respond to local needs. The programme,
                once approved, will commit us to delivering in many areas that
                fundamentally affect the lives of people in Northern Ireland. It
                commits us, for example, to appointing a commissioner for
                children by next June and developing a comprehensive 10-year
                strategy for children and young people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It confirms new action that we shall take to
                renew disadvantaged neighbourhoods and build community
                participation. That action includes a new regeneration
                initiative under URBAN II, which will be targeted at inner north
                Belfast. An additional 1,500 volunteers will be recruited
                through the active community initiative.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.00 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Programme for Government also sets out
                our commitment to put in place a cross-departmental strategy
                during 2002 that can effectively promote improved community
                relations. We have recently taken the initiative in north
                Belfast and we shall continue our efforts to improve community
                relations and tackle our society’s divisions. We must also
                recognise that community relations policy must encompass good
                relations between all communities, including the growing ethnic
                minority community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The programme underlines our commitment to
                targeting social need and promoting equality of opportunity. The
                new targeting social need (New TSN) policy aims to tackle social
                need and social exclusion. It applies to a range of policies and
                programmes across all Departments and throughout the Programme
                for Government. We have published New TSN action plans that show
                how Departments are redirecting efforts and available resources
                to those in greatest need. Those plans are currently being
                updated. The programme contains a specific commitment to ensure
                that the plans are fully implemented and that annual progress
                reports are published.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The programme also highlights the core
                principles and values of equality of opportunity and human
                rights, which are fundamental to our work. We remain committed
                to promoting equality and human rights through strong
                legislation, as well as through effective public policies and
                strategies. We are determined that no section of our community
                should feel excluded.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The programme commits us to implementing new
                actions that will provide good health and improved services for
                those who need treatment and care. In light of the Hayes report,
                that work will include development of our plans for a modern
                acute hospital service that meets local people’s needs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The programme commits us to introducing
                proposals by next September on the future structure of
                post-primary education. Those proposals will be shaped by the
                current consultation on the Burns report. The programme also
                sets out important commitments on underachieving schools,
                literacy and numeracy, and the introduction of a citizenship
                programme. It confirms our plans to extend third-level
                education, to provide new student support measures, to implement
                a new basic skills strategy and to provide additional help for
                the unemployed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have also included important commitments
                that will preserve cultural and information resources, and make
                them available to the widest possible audience. Those include
                the commitment to complete the electronic libraries project,
                which will link every public library to the Internet and open
                them up as electronic and information centres. The measure will
                ensure that people who do not have that technology at home are
                not disadvantaged.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are committed to completing all parts of
                the trans-European network from Larne to the border south of
                Newry in the coming years and to extending the gas network to
                make natural gas available to at least half the population of
                Northern Ireland. We shall also publish a Belfast metropolitan
                transport plan by December 2002 that will set out a 25-year
                vision for transport in the Belfast area. We are committed to
                increasing the number of new businesses and to securing more
                inward investment by knowledge-based industries.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The ‘Vision for the Future of the Agri-food
                Industry’ report has been published. The Programme for
                Government commits us to begin implementing an action plan
                arising from that report. Recognising the importance of
                developing all policies in line with our commitment to
                sustainability, we shall introduce a new sustainable development
                strategy by next October.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Programme for Government also sets out
                important commitments that reflect our desire to become a more
                outward-looking region. Real progress can now be seen in the
                work of the North/South institutions and on an east-west basis,
                as indicated in my earlier statements on the recent North/South
                Ministerial Council and British-Irish Council plenary meetings.
                We will continue to build relationships on this island and
                between the two islands, and we will maintain and develop our
                relationships in Europe and North America. Our new office in
                Brussels will open shortly, and the Northern Ireland Bureau’s
                move to new offices in downtown Washington, DC earlier this year
                has helped to create a defined and more clearly articulated
                regional voice for the Executive. Both offices will play
                important roles in delivering our commitment to developing
                effective links in Europe and effective representation in North
                America and to presenting a positive international image of
                Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those are just a few of the commitments made
                by the Executive. It is a challenging work programme, and we are
                committed to realising it. It will result in real progress in
                each of the five priority areas identified. However, we also
                recognise that other factors will influence our progress. It is
                essential to gain a better understanding of the needs of people
                here and of the effectiveness of our current policies in
                addressing those needs. For that reason our work programme for
                next year includes the completion of initial needs and
                effectiveness evaluations on our main spending programmes in
                health, education, training, housing and support for industry.
                Those major pieces of work will give us a clearer sense of the
                rationale for Government intervention and of the effectiveness
                of our policies and programmes. They should help us to develop a
                sound evidence base for future policy interventions. The work
                will also assist in pressing our case for a fair allocation of
                resources to Northern Ireland based on need.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The work programme for the year ahead is
                important, but so too is the process of refinement and
                development of the Programme for Government, which will continue
                year on year. In the coming year we must use the Programme for
                Government as a programming tool for the entire Executive. In
                one document we have a clear road map of the challenges we face,
                together with all the key policy areas. Such policies as need to
                work together to achieve sub-priorities and real change have
                been brigaded carefully. We need to improve only the means
                whereby Departments and agencies can work together across their
                boundaries to deliver those priorities and sub-priorities more
                effectively.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Departments working in isolation cannot
                pursue the work programme I have outlined. Members have
                frequently referred to the problem of a silo mentality, in which
                we can all too easily become trapped. Unless we have a clear
                description of the related policies and can see how we link
                together to achieve wider objectives, it is difficult not to be
                caught in a silo. The challenge is not only for Ministers but
                for everyone in the Assembly, and it can only be met head-on if
                we have a wider vision of why we are in Government and what we
                want to achieve. The Programme for Government can give that
                wider vision.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Systems must be set up to allow policy issues
                to be examined from the perspective of the Programme for
                Government as well as on a departmental basis. The exact
                mechanisms are under consideration. At official level, several
                interdepartmental groups work across those boundaries and seek
                to take a broader view. For example, the task force on the
                long-term unemployed, under Dr Seán Farren, seeks to draw
                together a wide range of policy issues from childcare to
                transport to social security, so that a real impact can be made
                on those who are caught in long-term unemployment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We will also establish a new
                interdepartmental steering group, to be chaired by Peter
                Robinson as Minister for Regional Development, to oversee
                progress on the regional development strategy and to ensure that
                the implementation of the key cross-cutting strategy is managed
                and monitored in a co-ordinated way.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The evidence shows that we will be most
                effective only if we take the broader view. A Department can do
                excellent work, but unless we have support for all aspects, we
                cannot make the real change that we want.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We will drive the change from the top by
                developing at ministerial level Executive sub-committees that
                can provide leadership and strategic direction to ensure a
                cross-cutting approach to policy development. That approach has
                been effective in the ministerial group on drug and alcohol
                misuse, but we need to extend and formalise the range of policy
                issues on which there is joint work at Executive level.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the next few months, therefore, we will
                work to ensure that we have a programming process that
                facilitates the development of a more effective approach. We
                want to see whether, for example, we can start to focus on
                clearer sets of policy priorities and outcomes that can help us
                to give expression to the vision that is set out in the
                document. The task is a complex one, and we realise that the
                process will take some time to develop. The need to learn to
                walk before we run was very much in our thoughts as we built the
                Programme for Government. We have developed the document
                further, and we will, with the assistance of the Assembly and
                its Committees, continue the development process.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I note that there is an amendment to the
                motion that invites the Assembly to not approve the Programme
                for Government. I am disappointed that such an amendment was
                considered necessary at the end of such a lengthy consultation
                process.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive are clear that tackling
                division and inequality is central to their work, and I referred
                to those issues in my statement, in respect of several aspects
                of the programme. They devoted a section of the programme
                entitled ‘Growing as a Community’ to address that range of
                issues. We are clear that division and inequality will not be
                eliminated in one year or in one Programme for Government.
                However, we are putting in place the necessary framework to
                tackle those issues on a long-term and sustainable basis through
                actions that include the development and harmonisation of
                anti-discrimination legislation, cross-departmental strategies
                to tackle gender and racial inequalities and the current review
                of community relations policies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Divisions continue in our society as
                evidenced by the Holy Cross situation and other recent
                incidents. The Executive have tackled manifestations of these
                problems, for example, through an initiative that was
                specifically targeted at north Belfast, but they are also
                tackling the cause of the problems. The programme stresses</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;the need to support the capacity of
                local communities to deal with matters of dispute and division
                including the proliferation of sectarian graffiti, unauthorised
                flag flying, the erection of memorials and other issues that can
                lead to community tensions.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, to successfully address these issues
                we must work together across Departments and across boundaries.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the debate on the Programme for Government
                of 13 November, Mr Ford, who has tabled the amendment, welcomed
                the fact that the Executive had addressed some of the concerns
                about community relations and tackling divisions that were
                raised in earlier debates. He also welcomed the fact that
                progress had been made. He even tried to take credit for the
                establishment of a cross- departmental group. Unfortunately, in
                the subsequent debate, no real practical suggestions came from
                that source to match his party’s rhetoric, but we look forward
                to such constructive input to the review of community relations
                policy as is covered in the Programme for Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The management guru, Peter Drucker, once said
                that</p>

                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive are committed to ensuring that
                their plans, as set out in the Programme for Government, are not
                merely good intentions. As an Administration, we all have much
                hard work to do to ensure that our policies and programmes
                address people’s needs. The Assembly has a key contribution to
                make towards ensuring that that hard work is done. We are ready
                for the hard work that is needed, and we look forward to working
                with the Assembly and our social partners in that task.</p>

                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;declines to approve the Northern
                Ireland Executive Programme for Government because it fails to
                adequately address the Executive’s stated priorities, does not
                tackle the deep divisions and inequalities in this society and
                therefore does not deliver the new beginning envisioned by the
                Good Friday Agreement.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I move the amendment, more in sorrow than in
                anger because the Alliance Party feels that it must clearly
                state its concerns about the Programme for Government that has
                been agreed by the Executive. Steps have been taken but,
                unfortunately, the sad fact is that Northern Ireland society
                continues to be defined by its deep divisions and inequalities.
                This programme, like its predecessor, compares favourably with
                those that have come forward from the Scottish Executive and the
                Welsh Assembly Cabinet. However, thankfully, those societies do
                not have the problems that permeate Northern Ireland. Therefore,
                despite the Executive’s constructive proposals on social,
                economic and environmental issues, it is progress in healing our
                divisions and reducing inequalities that will be the ultimate
                test of the success or failure of the Executive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To be credible, the Executive need to place
                the tackling of divisions and inequalities, as the Minister
                stated, at the heart of the programme. However, they fail in
                that. Instead, promoting equality of opportunity and human
                rights, and improving community relations and tackling the
                divisions in society are stated only as sub-priorities, under
                the heading ‘Growing as a Community’. This is not good
                enough and it is the reason for the Alliance Party’s
                amendment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive have made the task of
                addressing community disputes in north Belfast a priority.
                However, this is fire fighting rather than fire prevention. It
                costs much more, in time and resources, to address the violent
                manifestations of our problems than to address them before they
                flare up. It is not only in the area of health that prevention
                is better than cure. One of the paradoxes of the peace process
                is that society is more segregated today than at any other time
                in history. Segregation can be most clearly seen in the area of
                housing, both public and private.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Resolute action to create and maintain mixed
                workforces through fair employment legislation has had
                significant success. It is now time to address how we live. No
                one is suggesting that people should be forced to live in
                certain areas. Mixed housing should be proactively encouraged,
                yet it is not even mentioned in the programme.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Attention must turn to the barriers to mixed
                housing which begin with the control that paramilitaries still
                have over certain areas. The painting of kerbstones; murals that
                glorify the deeds of paramilitary organisations, and the illegal
                erection of flags, turn too many areas into ghettos. The message
                being sent is that such areas are the exclusive preserve of one
                or other side rather than being common civic spaces. People get
                the message, directly or indirectly, that they are not welcome
                in them. That occurs throughout the year, not just at sensitive
                times, and is felt not just by the perceived minority, but also
                by the perceived majority in these areas. This can be clearly
                seen in my area of North Down, yet everyone feels powerless to
                respond because the system does not work. It is therefore
                incumbent on the Executive to be proactive in that rather than
                merely pay lip service to the problem. My Colleague Kieran
                McCarthy has proposed having an Executive inter-agency working
                group, if that has not yet begun. The Department for Social
                Development should be mandated to work with the Housing
                Executive to pilot the creation and maintenance of mixed housing
                estates.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For historical reasons, it has become the
                norm for children to be educated in segregated schools. Despite
                the fact that integrated education is the norm in almost every
                other western European democracy, it is still regarded only as a
                peripheral alternative here. Only 4% of children here attend
                integrated schools, and it is a constant battle to get new
                schools built and existing schools to transform. A recent report
                by the Mixed Marriage Association stated that 68% of couples in
                mixed marriages would prefer integrated education. Where do
                their children go?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Children have a human right to be educated in
                mixed schools, but the Executive are only tinkering around the
                edges rather than actively encouraging such schools. Indeed, as
                education resources are already overstretched, surely it makes
                sense to encourage a sharing of built resources and the freeing
                up resources for investment in teachers and pupils.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There was talk of the need to recognise that
                a community relations policy must encompass good relations
                between all communities including our growing ethnic minority
                community. Those are great words, but past and present practice
                has been to assume that we are a society of two communities,
                rather than one community with great multicultural diversity and
                pluralism. That was never so clear as with the Assembly
                designations, but we await progress on that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Action on improving community relations has
                been deferred pending a review, and no specific measures have
                been proposed. Many of the myths about community relations still
                prevail today. It is now common for policies to be proofed
                against all sorts of criteria. Equality-proofing, rural-proofing
                and TSN-proofing are necessary and welcome. However, the
                Alliance Party would like to see all Executive and Northern
                Ireland Office policies proofed for their impact on promoting
                sharing rather than communal separation, a criterion that could
                be described as part of the past.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is also incumbent on the Executive to
                realise the potential for advancing Northern Ireland as a
                distinct region in many aspects of work. The more we do that,
                the more we help to create the notion that all the people of
                Northern Ireland are working towards a common, rather than a
                separate, set of objectives.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unless we begin to address seriously and
                directly the deep divisions in society, the very survival of the
                agreement will be under threat. We seem to reinforce the notion
                of a society of two separate but equal communities in an uneasy
                co-existence requiring constant skilful conflict management. In
                the absence of a meaningful strategy to improve community
                relations and promote sharing, it will be all too easy for
                communities to go their separate ways after a crisis — no
                doubt with substantial violence. We accept that it will be a
                long process, but a band-aid approach is not sufficient. We must
                address problems head-on, make substantial progress a priority
                and not sweep them under the carpet or treat them as side
                issues. I agree that we must meet the challenges, but we must
                meet them first on those substantive issues. We hope that the
                Executive listen and respond to our well-meaning comments. I
                support the amendment.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am pleased to contribute to this important
                debate. I covered most of the key points, including the need for
                education to be a central priority, in a debate a few weeks ago.
                I welcome broadly the Programme for Government, but will outline
                several of my Committee’s outstanding concerns.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our first concern is that numeracy and
                literacy targets for 14-year-olds have now been revised
                downwards in the Department of Education’s public service
                agreement. The target to be achieved by 2004, for mathematics
                and English, has been reduced from 75% to 72%. I am sorry that
                the Minister of Education is not in his place. My Committee has
                argued that those targets should not be revised downwards, and
                we are disappointed that the Executive have done so. Too many
                children leave school with inadequate levels of numeracy and
                literacy. The targets have now been reduced twice, and that is
                simply not good enough.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recently, I wrote to the Minister of
                Education about the issue. He replied:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The decision to reduce the targets had
                been taken on the basis of information from the Year 2000 Key
                Stage 3 assessments which indicated that, if the trend
                demonstrated were to continue, we would be unlikely to reach the
                previously stated target of 75%.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He added:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;We will examine the Key Stage results
                on an annual basis and if our current assessment proves overly
                conservative I will be happy to revise the targets again in the
                light of new evidence.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The purpose of public service agreements is
                not to set targets for a three-year period and then revise them
                downwards each year if we are not doing well enough. I believed
                that the whole purpose of the Programme for Government and
                public service agreements was to identify the key priorities of
                the Executive, and to set targets accordingly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Budget allocations reflect the priorities
                in the Programme for Government, and the Department of
                Education, strongly backed by my Committee, has received
                substantial funding aimed at meeting this priority — most
                recently from the Executive programme funds. We are allocating
                more money to fulfil that key priority, yet targets are being
                reduced again. If, next year, the 2001 key stage results do not
                indicate that there has been satisfactory progress, will the
                targets be reduced for a third time? I will seek an assurance
                from the relevant Minister that that will not be the case.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Committee also believes that rather than
                reduce targets for 2004 as soon as it appears that they will not
                be achieved, the Department of Education should identify the
                reasons for the lack of progress and take appropriate action to
                address the problems.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to highlight the commitment in the
                Programme for Government to continue to invest in the quality of
                our teachers and principals. My Committee recommended the
                inclusion in ‘Investing in Education and Skills’ a target to
                carry out a review into the pay levels, the salary structures,
                the workload, and the conditions of service for principals,
                vice-principals and teachers. Unfortunately, it was not
                included, the stated reason being that it would have been
                premature to do so, given that discussions on the matter were
                ongoing. However, my Committee believes that such a target ought
                to have been included in the Programme for Government because it
                would have indicated properly our commitment to principals and
                teachers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One sentence, with no target or timescale, is
                not an adequate reflection. Principals and teachers, who are the
                cornerstone of our education system, feel overworked and
                undervalued. For a long time, morale and motivation have been
                extremely low. One teachers’ union has initiated industrial
                action, and others have indicated their intention to do
                likewise; therefore it is not premature to include a target to
                address that long-standing problem. Indeed, a commitment in an
                important document such as the Programme for Government might
                well have eased the problem.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.30 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Education said that he
                intends to include proposals for the implementation of the Burns
                Report in next year’s Programme for Government. I welcome
                that, but it is important to stress that they are proposals and
                not legislation — I will seek the Minister’s confirmation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the launch of a comprehensive
                review of public administration by spring 2002. That is
                particularly relevant for education, which received £60 million
                of public money for administration costs. The Education
                Committee would like to know the completion date of the review
                as soon as possible, in order to include it in next year’s
                Programme for Government.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Byrne:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I congratulate the First Minister, the Deputy
                First Minister and, indeed, their predecessors, for conducting
                such a transparent and wide-ranging consultation process on the
                formulation of the Programme for Government for 2002-03. As the
                document shows, the Assembly and its Committees have had the
                experience of a full year of debates on policies, and it has
                been an invaluable learning experience. Despite some criticism
                in the media, the policies outlined in the Programme for
                Government are evidence that the devolved institutions and
                locally elected Ministers can deliver stable government and
                implement measures that shape the social and economic directions
                of our society.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The current Programme for Government is a
                development plan for progress, to point us in the right
                direction. I welcome the objectives outlined in the public
                service agreement (PSA) of the Department for Regional
                Development. They will shape the region’s long-term strategic
                development.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the years of direct rule, the North’s
                infrastructure developed on a very uneven basis and was
                concentrated on the north-east, which led to social exclusion
                for some parts of the region. Now that we have devolved power,
                the improvement of Northern Ireland’s infrastructure must take
                place in a balanced fashion throughout the region, so that urban
                and rural citizens have equal access to roads, transport and
                water and sewage services, and the competitiveness of the
                economy will be enhanced.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am pleased that the upgrading of several
                key strategic routes is regarded as a priority. For example, I
                welcome the Programme for Government’s commitment to allocate
                £40 million from the Executive programme fund for
                infrastructure to complete all the parts of the trans-European
                transport status (TENS) route from Larne to the border, south of
                Newry. However, I remind the Executive and the Minister for
                Regional Development that other important TENS routes, such as
                Dublin to Monaghan and Omagh to Derry, should also be upgraded.
                The upgrading of these routes is vital in helping to attract
                inward investment, enabling local firms to expand and enhancing
                safety for motorists.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is therefore essential that when the
                10-year regional transportation strategy is adopted, it marks a
                radical departure from what we have experienced to date. All too
                often, those of us who live west of the Bann have had to make do
                with totally inadequate roads and a limited public transport
                system. This has had a detrimental effect on the local economy
                and the quality of life of rural residents. Therefore, we must
                invest in a safe, efficient and integrated transportation
                infrastructure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The regional transportation strategy must be
                placed in the context of European Union and North/South
                transport planning, with particular reference to the Irish
                Republic’s national development plan and the national spatial
                strategy. In the Executive, the principles of joined-up
                government must guide the implementation of the new
                transportation strategy. The Executive must work collectively to
                ensure that transportation policy is formulated with reference
                to economic development and the development of Northern Ireland’s
                energy and technology infrastructure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recently, the Committee for Regional
                Development held a formal meeting in the Guildhall in Derry and
                heard strong representations on the transport difficulties of
                the north-west area. In particular, there was a fully agreed and
                presented position from Derry City Council, the North-West
                Region Cross-Border Group — involving Limavady Borough
                Council, Strabane District Council, Derry City Council and
                Donegal County Council — and the business community. The
                position was that capital investment in the TENS roads and the
                railway system was vital for economic development in the
                counties of Derry, Tyrone and Donegal. It is extremely important
                that the regional transportation strategy, being finalised, must
                be sufficiently determined and developed so that it dovetails
                smoothly and effectively with the recently agreed regional
                development strategy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to the Department for Employment
                and Learning, I particularly welcome the additional expenditure
                designed to increase the number of further and higher education
                places and the target of achieving a total enrolment of 35,000
                full-time students in higher education. I also welcome the
                objective of increasing enrolment in further education colleges
                by 5% in the key areas of tourism, catering, computing,
                engineering and construction.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given that Northern Ireland’s unemployment
                is above the UK average, and given our high dependence on the
                public sector, the enhancement of the skills level of the
                workforce is important in creating a vibrant economy. However,
                it is also important to ensure that resources are properly
                targeted and that people such as the long-term unemployed are
                not exploited. Therefore, I welcome the Minister’s recent
                decision to close the individual learning account (ILA) scheme,
                which was open to exploitation, ahead of the planned suspension
                date. As many adults in the North lack basic literacy and
                numeracy skills, it is important that we implement a skills
                programme which encourages lifelong learning, which is properly
                resourced and which targets those most in need. The ILA system
                must be primarily promoted and managed because of the net
                benefit it can bring to client trainees who require up-skilling
                and personal development.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With reference to the Department of
                Enterprise, Trade and Investment, I welcome the targets of
                achieving growth in export sales and net employment, and also
                the commitment to attract 75% of all first-time investment
                projects to new targeting social need (New TSN) areas. The new
                single economic development agency, Invest Northern Ireland,
                provides the opportunity for a new approach to attracting inward
                investment and delivering a more effective range of services to
                entrepreneurs. To meet this requirement, it is essential that
                the new agency maintains offices that are geographically spread
                throughout Northern Ireland, not just primarily located in
                Belfast.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the Department of Enterprise, Trade and
                Investment is to be able to live up to these commitments, it is
                important that the Department be properly resourced. I am
                concerned that, given the current economic slowdown, planned
                expenditure for 2002-03 will decrease by 1·3%. Nevertheless, I
                am pleased to read that the Executive have given a clear
                commitment to significantly increase investment should the need,
                or some particular opportunity, arise.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also want to take the opportunity to
                welcome the commitments given in the Programme for Government to
                complete reviews of promotion and recruitment to senior
                positions in the Civil Service and Government office
                accommodation. That will include an examination of the
                possibility of decentralising Civil Service jobs. Over the past
                two years, my party has consistently lobbied for the
                decentralisation of Civil Service jobs. We believe that the
                Executive should lead by example and relocate entire sections of
                Departments from Belfast to the main towns. Such a policy would
                help to achieve more balanced growth beyond the Greater Belfast
                area and bring government closer to the people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is an ambitious and imaginative
                Programme for Government, geared towards addressing the social
                and economic damage done by almost three decades of direct rule.
                It is an example of what can be achieved if we work
                constructively in the Executive, the Assembly Committees and
                beyond, and it has given many people the opportunity to make an
                input. It demonstrates that the Administration listen to the
                concerns of ordinary people and that they are determined to make
                a difference.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have a difficult task, but the 2002-03
                Programme for Government — guided by new TSN, the statutory
                equality legislation and the public service agreements — will
                build on the progress that has been made in implementing the
                first Programme for Government. It provides the opportunity to
                deliver real change through stable, effective and transparent
                government and create in Northern Ireland a cohesive, inclusive
                and economically vibrant society.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important that our Programme for
                Government should develop our economy and, over time, tackle the
                social problems of unemployment and poverty, so that everyone
                feels that devolution can bring net benefits to individuals and
                the collective community. I endorse the finalised Programme for
                Government: we should support it and help to build a better
                Northern Ireland and a harmonious community.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Committee for
                Agriculture and Rural Development (Rev Dr Ian Paisley):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sub- priority 8, headed &quot;We will work
                together to regenerate the rural economy&quot;, is the main area
                of interest for the Committee in the chapter on the economy. One
                of the main commitments made in that sub-priority is the
                publication of a plan of action for the strategic development of
                the agrifood industry. That plan will emanate from the vision
                group’s report on the industry’s future. That commitment is
                welcome, especially as several of the vision group’s
                recommendations are consistent with those that have already been
                made in the Agriculture Committee’s reports. However, members
                of the Committee remain deeply concerned that none of the
                additional funding identified in the Budget has been allocated
                to the matter. It will be extremely difficult for the Department
                of Agriculture and Rural Development to translate a plan into
                tangible action, especially if the Department recommends a new
                direction. The Committee has raised that issue in its Budget
                deliberations and will continue to do so.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another commitment by which the vision group
                and others have set great store is the introduction of what is
                called &quot;rural proofing&quot; as part of general policy
                implementation. Over a year ago, the Committee welcomed the
                proposal for rural proofing, but had concerns that it was little
                more than a concept, rather than a matter for action. According
                to the current Programme for Government, a ministerial-led group
                to carry out rural proofing of Government policies should have
                been established by April 2001.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.45 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sadly, when our Committee met on Friday 8
                December, eight months after the target date for setting up that
                important group, the Minister remained unable to update the
                Committee on its establishment. Rural proofing has been heralded
                as being vital to ensure a fair deal for all rural areas. The
                commitment to rural proofing is reiterated in the document that
                we are debating today. It must, like the action plan, be
                progressed urgently from concept to reality if the commitments
                are to mean anything. Members will be disappointed that that has
                not been taken on board, but will watch with interest to see how
                the Executive ensure that all relevant agencies work together,
                as set out in the third paragraph of section 5.10.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The third paragraph of section 5.11 sets out
                plans to introduce regulations covering the storage of silage,
                slurry and agricultural fuel oils, which are the waste products
                of farming. It is unfortunate that, although the Department of
                the Environment has already put forward its proposals for
                regulations, the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development’s
                bid for Executive programme funds to help to establish a farm
                waste management scheme was not included in last week’s
                announcement. Extra money could have provided well-targeted
                funds to enable farmers to meet their obligations under the new
                regulations. With farm incomes at such low levels, it is
                unreasonable to expect farmers to fund major improvements
                themselves. The Committee reissues its call for close
                co-operation between the two Departments involved to ensure that
                there is action proportionate to risk and to take affordability
                into account.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the Committee’s written response to the
                draft Programme for Government, it pointed out that the sub-
                priority on the rural economy did not mention the sea fisheries
                fleet or the communities that rely on the fisheries industry.
                Members who have been taking note of what is happening in Europe
                must be flabbergasted by the drawing of a dagger that will
                strike at the very heart of the fishing industry.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Committee decided that we had better go to
                Europe, with the co-operation of the three MEPs from Northern
                Ireland, to talk to Commissioner Fischler. If the figures that
                we have seen are correct, and if Commissioner Fischler acts
                according to the proposals, that will mark the end of the
                fishing industry in Northern Ireland. The fishing industry
                cannot afford to have £1·7 million deducted from its total
                income.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those are matters of deep concern. The
                Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development has the full
                backing of the Committee on the fisheries issue. She has
                expressed her happiness that the Committee will be standing with
                her in her fight to salvage something from the disastrous
                proposals that are to be put forward in Europe next week.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Maskey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I
                support the motion. I reject the amendment on the basis that, as
                the Deputy First Minister said, the matter has been debated
                considerably. This is the second year of the Programme for
                Government. The document is moderate in its ambitions, and many
                measures could be described as being vague or, in some cases,
                ill-defined.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Programme for Government has been
                developed against a fairly difficult background. This is the
                institutions’ first term, and there have been serious
                political difficulties in the past couple of years. Therefore,
                the Programme for Government maps out the way forward, albeit in
                a moderate way. As other Members have said, it is the result of
                a great deal of work by the Executive and many of the
                Committees. There has been a fair amount of consultation on and
                input into the Programme for Government. The programme has
                established new priorities in health, education and other areas
                that are of concern to constituents. Members have raised those
                concerns on numerous occasions, both inside and outside the
                Chamber. The programme has already been described as
                developmental and work in hand.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The year 2002 will be one to watch. The
                Programme for Government is worthy of the Assembly’s
                endorsement insofar as it is work in hand. It will be
                interesting to see how many of the reviews and developing
                strategies will make an impact. Sub-priority 1 of the section
                titled &quot;Growing as a Community&quot; describes the
                strategies that will be introduced in 2002 to bring together the
                anti- discrimination measures. It also mentions how the
                Executive propose to deal with gender and racial inequalities,
                the reviews into the workings and needs of the travelling
                community and the critical area of the overall complexion and
                working practices of the Civil Service. I look forward to seeing
                how those completed studies and strategies will impact in 2002.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sub-priority 4 of the section titled
                &quot;Working Together&quot; deals with how the Executive will
                find new ways to finance public services. I am grateful that the
                Department of Finance and Personnel and the Executive will
                announce the results of the review into public-private
                partnerships (PPPs) and private finance initiatives (PFIs). I
                remind the House — and critics outside the Assembly — that
                the Committee for Finance and Personnel took the lead when it
                held an inquiry into PPP. The work that we put into that
                inquiry, in co-operation with the Department of Finance and
                Personnel, is testimony to the fact that Assembly Members from
                all parties recognise that PPP is a big issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There have been critics outside the Assembly.
                Even in the past week or two, some people from the trade union
                movement who did not even bother to participate in the inquiry,
                despite the fact that it was publicly convened, have been
                critical. Some parties in the Executive have concerns about PPPs.
                However, the Committee for Finance and Personnel treated the
                issue seriously enough to have an inquiry. That inquiry took up
                much of the Committee’s time and effort. It held sessions
                here, in Dublin, in London and in Leeds. I look forward to the
                findings of the review undertaken by the Executive’s working
                group.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am concerned about the rates review, which
                Members are now advised will not conclude until the end of 2001.
                That means that any action taken will not be implemented until
                2003 or 2004. I have never suggested that there are any easy
                fixes, but it would have been helpful if the rates review had
                been conducted and completed earlier so that some of the
                inequalities could have been addressed. However, I welcome the
                fact that the rates review has been conducted, and I look
                forward to its recommendations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am encouraged by the intention of the
                Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure, and its Minister, to
                promote greater respect for cultural diversity, et cetera.
                However, I have heard criticisms levelled at the Minister on
                what appears to be an emerging partisan approach by his
                Department to certain political commemorations. I hope that the
                Minister has taken on board some of the criticisms that were
                levelled recently — I do not intend to repeat them today.
                Again, I welcome the intentions in the sections of the document
                that relate to the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure. I
                hope that it works out in an equal way in the future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I echo some of the concerns raised earlier by
                Danny Kennedy about the public service agreements. It is my
                understanding that they will, in effect, be binding contracts
                between the Departments and the wider public. Some of them are
                ill-defined and rather vague and have again involved slippage.
                That is a matter for concern.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">By and large, I support the Programme for
                Government, despite the fact that it is a moderate document —
                I would not say that it is ambitious. However, it is useful and
                important, and we will have to watch how the strategies and
                reviews affect the issues that many of us continue to address. I
                support the Programme for Government, and I reject the
                amendment. However, I certainly do not reject some of the
                concerns expressed in the amendment. Others will undoubtedly
                support the Programme for Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the fact that we have this document
                — it is work in hand. We will have to use this first term of
                the Assembly to try to get our systems right, and we are moving
                in that direction. By the end of term I hope that we will be
                able to demonstrate to the wider public that these institutions
                are worth having and that they will have a clear impact,
                particularly on socially disadvantaged and excluded areas and
                peoples.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of the Environment (Mr Foster):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I find it gratifying that the Chamber is able
                to debate the second Programme for Government reflecting the
                benefit of locally elected politicians working together to
                enhance the standard of living of all of the people in Northern
                Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the previous debate on this Programme for
                Government, I focused on my Department’s contribution to the
                first one. Today I wish to highlight some major actions in the
                2002-05 Programme for Government that my Department will
                undertake. Yet again, these actions reflect the importance that
                the Executive, the Chamber and the public place on environmental
                issues. Clear evidence of this is the fact that my Department’s
                funding for 2002-03 has increased by 10% to almost £111
                million. Clearly we must continue to take actions that safeguard
                the environment and contribute to improving the health and
                well-being of our people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is with these objectives in mind that my
                Department is considering consultation responses on a road
                safety strategy for the next 10 years. The document sets out in
                some detail how the various Departments and agencies involved in
                road safety are seeking to improve our road safety record. It
                also proposes challenging road casualty reduction targets and a
                strategy for achieving them. In March next year my Department
                will publish a strategic plan that will take account of the
                comments received from the consultation exercise.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Waste management is another major issue that
                we need to continue to address. Recycling and market development
                for recovered materials are key elements of the waste management
                strategy, and my Department will be working closely with the
                Waste Management Advisory Board on a public awareness campaign
                to promote both waste minimisation and recycling.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We will also extend the waste and resource
                action programme in Great Britain to Northern Ireland to assist
                in creating a stable and efficient market for recycled products.
                I particularly welcome the Committee for the Environment’s
                call for economic development agencies to be involved in this.
                There is a clear need for us to work together on this, and my
                officials will be working with the Department of Enterprise,
                Trade and Investment and key business sector representatives on
                the Waste Management Advisory Board to develop the market
                programme.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am keen to see openness and transparency in
                the planning process. For that reason, on 1 November, my
                Department introduced a number of measures to achieve this as
                part of a commitment given in the Programme for Government. Some
                of the key elements of these changes are: letting people know
                the reasons for a planning decision; making available
                representations on planning applications, including objections;
                making available details of consultations with district
                councils; and enhanced access to the planning application files.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A leaflet that explains the planning process
                to the public has been produced. These measures significantly
                enhance the customer focus of Planning Service and should help
                the public to understand better the importance that the planning
                process plays in protecting our environment.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Executive Colleagues and I recognise that
                the integration of sustainable development principles into
                society in Northern Ireland presents a challenging agenda. We
                need to obtain the ideas of as many sectors, groups and
                individuals as we can, and not just those of Government. For
                that reason my Department has plans to consult widely, early in
                the new year, on proposals for a Northern Ireland sustainable
                development strategy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am also pleased that the Executive were
                able to restore the £2 million of provision for my Department’s
                resources grant to district councils. That is most welcome. It
                will avoid the need for a reduction in the grant, and it will
                ensure that full assistance can be given to the poorest council
                areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I intend to build on the actions that my
                Department has taken, and those that it intends to take in the
                coming year, and I look forward to working closely with the
                Committee for the Environment to take forward the many
                challenging objectives that have been set in the Programme for
                Government.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Gallagher:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion and agree with most of
                the content of the Programme for Government. I would appreciate
                clarification on a few points, one of which is in relation to
                the Health Service. Having said that, I welcome the Department
                of Health, Social Services and Public Safety’s commitment to
                bring about improvements in the Health Service, particularly in
                primary and acute care, in the coming year. I note that the
                Department has committed itself to publishing plans by December
                2002 for the modernisation of our acute hospital services. We
                are all well aware of the problems in the Health Service and
                especially those in relation to acute services. I do not want to
                rehearse those problems here, but it has to be said that the
                crisis in acute hospital services is growing. Indeed, many
                people would pose the question &quot;Why do we have to wait for
                another year before decisions are taken about that important
                sector?&quot; While we are waiting, services at many of our
                local hospitals are being whittled away, and we know that that
                in turn leads to larger hospitals being unable to cope with the
                extra pressures that are placed upon them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many consultations have been carried out on
                the future of acute hospital services — the most notable being
                the recent one carried out by the Hayes review group. That group
                was both independent and representative, and it made specific
                recommendations about the way forward. Many people are now fed
                up with consultations, and the view is that it is time to take
                decisions about future hospital services.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What does the statement on page 29 of the
                Programme for Government mean when it says:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The Executive will shortly be involved
                in discussions, leading to the issue of a consultation paper
                which will consider the way forward. We expect to take decisions
                in the course of 2002 and will take steps in the meantime to
                maintain safe and effective services at smaller
                hospitals.&quot;?</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Are we now being told that the Executive are
                embarking on a further consultation on acute hospital services?
                What does that statement mean? Will it result in further delays
                in implementing a plan or will the Minister of Health, Social
                Services and Public Safety deliver the long-overdue decisions on
                the way forward by December 2002, as indicated in the Programme
                for Government?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the commitment to the reform of
                public administration and the development of a plan for the
                decentralisation of Civil Service jobs. I note that consultation
                will continue from spring 2002 to November 2002. As a
                representative of a constituency with high levels of economic
                deprivation — and most people are aware that the Fermanagh
                area has lost 1,000 jobs over the last four years — I am in no
                doubt that the decentralisation of Civil Service jobs can
                improve the economies of such areas. Constituencies in deprived
                areas should be given special consideration in the
                decentralisation programme.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the work that is to go ahead over
                the next year, and I look forward to the plans coming to
                fruition. However, I would like some specific information about
                relocation. On the foot of the work that they have outlined for
                next year, do the Executive expect to be able to take decisions
                about relocating Government jobs at the end of next year, or do
                they have a later date in mind?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Committee for the
                Environment (Rev Dr William McCrea):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On 13 November, as Chairperson of the
                Committee for the Environment, I drew the attention of Members
                to an important paragraph entitled ‘Promoting sustainable
                living’ on page 8 of the draft Programme for Government. The
                Committee for the Environment noted the designation of
                sustainable development as a key theme, cutting across the five
                priority areas in the Programme for Government. However, the
                draft document fell seriously short in reflecting the Executive’s
                commitment to promoting sustainable living in their priorities
                and sub-priorities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I detailed several of the Committee’s
                recommendations in an attempt to rectify that. Unfortunately,
                the document before us reflects only a few of those
                recommendations. For example, on page 69 there is now a
                reference to being &quot;conscious of environmental issues&quot;
                in seeking to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of public
                service. In the same paragraph it states:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Working with local government, we will
                develop and promote good working practices and procedures under
                Best Value aimed at delivering effective, efficient and quality
                local services.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the Minister had been listening to the
                Committee’s debate, he would have found that it is most
                anxious to have effective, efficient and quality local services.
                However, even at this late stage, I again implore the Minister
                and the Department to agree with the representation that was
                made by the Committee to implement best value on a voluntary
                basis and not on the legalistic approach that the Department has
                indicated. I have the full backing of the Committee to make that
                request.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An implementation plan to improve public
                procurement is referred to immediately below the statement:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;In seeking to improve efficiency we
                shall also be conscious of environment issues set out in
                paragraph 5.11.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I trust that the implementation plan will
                fully demonstrate that there is, in practice, a significant
                commitment to sustainable living by developing environmentally
                sustainable Government procurement policies across all
                Departments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Government action on environmentally sound
                practices could dramatically impact on the development of
                markets for recycled and recoverable materials, thus boosting
                the prospects for the successful implementation of the Northern
                Ireland waste management strategy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On page 69 there is a commitment to:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;launch a comprehensive review of public
                administration by spring 2002.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is a long-awaited and badly needed
                statement. I ask that a timetable for the urgent implementation
                of that review be drawn up and brought before the Assembly for
                debate as soon as possible.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee for the Environment is
                currently taking a keen interest in the progress of the
                development of effective waste management plans to underpin the
                waste management strategy for Northern Ireland. In the opinion
                of the Committee, progress on that and on other important areas
                of the strategy has been too slow. The Committee notes,
                therefore, the new commitment on page 54 of the Programme for
                Government that the strategy</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;creates opportunities for Northern
                Ireland to become a leading example of sustainable resources and
                waste management.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I trust those are not just fine words and
                phrases, and that action will be taken to deliver on that
                commitment and to reach an agreement with the waste management
                advisory board, by June 2002, on a public awareness campaign to
                increase waste minimisation and recycling.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee notes that on page 48 of the
                programme the word &quot;sustainable&quot; now describes the
                business start programmes. I hope that that is met in every
                sense, through the commitment to achieve 6,000 new sustainable
                business starts over the period to March 2005.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee is disappointed that the
                Executive have not improved the reference to the environment in
                the overview to ‘Securing a Competitive Economy’ on pages 42
                and 43. The Committee has suggested a more ambitious approach to
                the integration of environmental themes into economic policy. In
                the context of sustainable development, the environment should
                no longer be viewed as a constraint on economic activity. The
                environment and sustainable development represent opportunities
                to support and develop new economic and job creation activities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On page 43 it is stated that</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;We will work to protect and enhance our
                natural and built environment.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members of the Committee would agree with
                those words but would like a clear outline of the action that
                will be taken by the Department of the Environment to protect
                and enhance our natural and built environment. There are
                concerns that our natural and built environment have been under
                threat on many occasions, and that no action has been taken.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The reference to renewable energy on page 45
                could have been widened to take account of sustainable economic
                development opportunities for new technology, research,
                development, production and export.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, the Committee notes that the
                Department of the Environment’s public service agreement
                target for river pollution is:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;To maintain or improve Year 2000 levels
                of river water quality (both chemical and biological).&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Why was a more ambitious target not set,
                bearing in mind the number of instances of serious river
                pollution over the past year?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I trust that the relevant Ministers will
                answer these questions.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Committee for Social

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I said during the debate on the draft
                Programme for Government last month, the Committee for Social
                Development is most concerned with two sections — section 2,
                ‘Growing as a Community’, and section 7, ‘Working Together’.
                The Committee made representations on those sections.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The foreword to the Programme for Government
                acknowledges the feedback from Assembly Committees, and suggests

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;This document has been revisited and
                revised in the light of that feedback.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It continues:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;although we have not been able to
                respond immediately to the many suggestions made during
                consultation, we would also like to reassure those who responded
                that their views and comments will continue to have an influence
                as the Executive takes forward work to develop the Programme
                over the months and years ahead.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee for Social Development welcomes
                that assurance and will watch those developments with interest.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee continues to be content to
                endorse the priorities and sub-priorities in the two sections
                that I mentioned earlier and remains broadly satisfied with the
                associated actions and commitments. However, the latest version
                of the Programme for Government does little to allay the
                Committee’s concerns about the precise way in which social
                need is to be tackled and how the needs of those in poverty will
                be addressed in practice. No doubt, there will be those who say
                that the service delivery agreements (SDAs) are the place for
                detail.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee will meet with officials from
                the Department for Social Development to discuss those SDAs and
                will reiterate that the decision to change the format and
                presentation of the Programme for Government is short-sighted.
                Those changes deny the Committee and the public at large the
                opportunity to compare performances year on year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Last month, the Committee pleaded for a bold,
                bottom-up approach towards calculating the Budget based on the
                cost of funding particular priority programmes rather than
                setting a broad-based agenda and then facing the dilemma of
                assigning resources for too broad a range of programmes. That
                plea has gone unanswered. I am already on record as saying that
                we are in danger of promising much but delivering little, that
                the jam has been spread too thinly and that we run the risk of
                underachieving. I continue to hold these views.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department for Social Development deals,
                in the main, with some of the most marginalised people in
                society. The Committee has urged the Minister for Social
                Development to extend the scope of the warm homes scheme to
                accelerate its progress. The Committee does not deny the cost
                implications and the competition for funding but, as the
                Committee has said all along, the costs associated with the warm
                homes scheme are indisputably one-off capital payments rather
                than a recurring drain on public resources.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The early eradication of fuel poverty would
                not only ease the recurring financial pressure on the health
                budget, but would also positively contribute to the health and
                well-being of people who are among the most marginalised.
                However, people who are over 60 with a small occupational
                pension continue to be excluded, as do families with young
                children.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is not to say that the Committee does
                not appreciate that the sums available for the warm homes scheme
                will apparently be doubled to £8 million. However, last month
                the Committee for Social Development welcomed the inclusion of a
                reference in the Programme for Government to supporting people
                and the proposed introduction of a new scheme for funding
                housing support costs by 2003. It will undoubtedly be necessary
                to plan for and train staff in advance of the introduction of
                the new scheme. The Committee raised concerns about how the
                scheme is likely to be financed as there appears to be no
                reference to it in the draft Budget, but the Committee has had
                no reply.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Section 2, sub-priority 7, relates to housing
                and contains promises to improve services and the quality of
                accommodation generally and to increase the number of properties
                built to meet special needs. The housing budget will rise by
                £6·2 million next year, but £4 million of that has already
                been earmarked for the warm homes scheme, leaving £2·2 million
                for other housing improvements — a sum that is unlikely even
                to offset the cost of inflation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members from across the House acknowledge the
                continued importance that social housing plays in society and
                the fact that it deserves to be properly financed. I will be
                amazed, as the Committee will be, if we manage to keep pace with
                this year’s Programme for Government objectives, let alone
                improve on them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have also given notice of the Committee’s
                intention to monitor carefully the Social Security Agency and
                the Child Support Agency. Vast sums of public money are to be
                invested to enable both agencies to improve the accuracy and
                speed of their claims handling. Some members of the Committee
                for Social Development recently visited a service that is being
                piloted in Dungannon that delivers a single point of access for
                some services provided by the Training &amp; Employment Agency
                and some benefits administered by the Social Security Agency.
                Members were impressed by what they saw and will be interested
                to see the findings of the evaluation of the pilot scheme and
                what it might mean for extending the programme across the
                region.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In conclusion, the Social Development
                Committee recognises that much of the policy for tackling
                disadvantage and community development is under review.
                Nevertheless, it is a vitally important area of spending
                priority. The issue must be raised in tomorrow’s debate, and I
                will save my remarks until then.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Committee for Culture,
                Arts and Leisure (Mr ONeill):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have comments of my own to make, but I
                begin with those of the Committee. The Committee was especially
                pleased that the Programme for Government identified a
                significant contribution in each of the Executive’s
                priorities. In particular, the Committee noted that the revised
                programme highlights more clearly the role of the Department of
                Culture, Arts and Leisure in the delivery of almost all of those
                priorities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Key priority 6 deals with the development of
                North/ South, east/west and international relations, and I want
                to focus on that. The Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure
                has an important contribution to make, and the Committee has
                noted that six of the seven sub- priorities relate directly to
                the Department’s area of responsibility. In particular, we
                hope that the support indicated in sub-priority 5 for Imagine
                Belfast’s bid to be European Capital of Culture 2008 will be
                reflected in financial allocations for next year and beyond.
                Belfast will compete against cities such as Liverpool,
                Birmingham, Cardiff, Bradford, Oxford and Brighton, and against
                joint bids from Newcastle/Gateshead and Bristol/Bath.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The bid must be submitted to the Department
                for Culture, Media and Sport by March 2002, and a shortlist of
                three cities will be drawn up. The final decision on which of
                the three will go forward to Europe as the UK’s recommendation
                will be made in March 2003. At that stage the competition will
                become even tougher. Even at the UK selection stage the Northern
                Ireland bid will be up against serious opposition from cities
                with well-developed physical and cultural infrastructures,
                cities which have not had to live with the eyes of the world
                upon them for all the wrong reasons.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No other city has the opportunity for change
                and growth which Belfast now has. Our people, our culture, our
                history and our rich creative potential have been obscured in
                recent times, and the decision to bid for European Capital of
                Culture 2008 gives us a unique chance to rediscover those. The
                major success stories are there to be aspired to and learnt
                from. The most significant and tangible story is that of
                Glasgow, whose exceptional success can be explained by its bid’s
                having been strongly focused on people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The comparison between Belfast and Glasgow is
                striking. Glasgow in the 1980s was a hard-edged, post-
                industrial city suffering from declining industries, years of
                under-resourcing, a poor self-image and with little to offer the
                visitor. Through the City of Culture process, the emphasis on
                education, training, community development, social inclusion and
                changing mindsets has paid off in every way. Importantly, it was
                not just a one-year wonder. Glasgow’s regeneration and
                rejuvenation as City of Culture 1990 has had a lasting legacy,
                and the city continues to grow in confidence and prosperity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is an opportunity for us, and those
                goals lie at the heart of the priorities set out in the
                Programme for Government. I recognise that the necessary
                resources may be considerable, but I call on the Executive and
                this House to make a commitment, not only to provide those but
                also for proper joined-up government to take hold of the
                opportunity so that Departments work together to provide the
                support necessary for the bid to succeed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The comments which follow come from my
                membership of the Social Development Committee. Some of them
                support the concern indicated earlier by the Committee
                Chairperson. As ever, the funding issue is critical, and nowhere
                can that be seen more than in housing. I am particularly
                concerned about the spiralling problem of homelessness. In
                2000-01, over 12,694 people were homeless in Northern Ireland,
                constituting the highest rate of homelessness per head of the
                population in any region, including England, Scotland and Wales.
                It is a 24% increase on last year, and as I pointed out in the
                debate on homelessness, the previous year saw a 17% increase. It
                is a steadily growing problem. A comparison of the figures from
                1991-92 and 2000-01 shows that over those ten years homelessness
                grew by 26%. Is the problem spiralling out of control?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I urge that homelessness be made a priority
                in the Programme for Government. It says on page 19 of that
                document that</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;we will work to ensure that everyone
                has the opportunity to access decent, affordable housing.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is an umbrella statement that does not
                focus directly on the real problems; it is aspirational. When I
                asked the former Minister for Social Development if he was
                willing to support the aspiration, he clearly was — but only
                as an aspiration. When I asked him for a financial commitment,
                he would not give it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Homelessness does not need more aspirational
                support. It needs practical support. There is a need for both
                financial and legislative support. Northern Ireland has already
                fallen behind other regions in legislative terms. I hope and
                expect that the new housing Bill will contain the necessary
                adjustments to bring us up to date. Meanwhile, the focus must be
                on finance for new build, temporary accommodation and health and
                social services support for those in that dreadful situation.
                The requirements were well identified by the contributors to the
                debate on homelessness, which was carried unanimously.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive and the House rightly support
                the prioritisation of health and education. Those Departments
                get some 60% of the Budget, but there are health and educational
                dimensions to homelessness. The World Health Organisation (WHO)
                document ‘Health for All’ identified adequate shelter as a
                prerequisite for good health, and many official strategy
                documents regularly identify housing as one of the key factors
                that affect health.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a widely held view amongst
                educationalists that a stable and secure home is a vital element
                in building an environment for children to learn and to develop
                into fulfilled and motivated adults. How can education be
                successful when people are faced with the trauma and disruption
                of temporary accommodation and rehousing to other areas?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is also difficult for young homeless
                people to access education and training opportunities, and New
                TSN makes a clear case for the prioritisation of homelessness.
                Making homelessness a priority will open the opportunity for
                access to Executive programme funds. The funds’ objectives
                clearly state that they will have particular regard for the
                Executive’s priorities, as set out in the Programme for
                Government, and also for their commitments to equality and New
                TSN. Given that, I vote that we make progress to improve this
                terrible situation.</p>

                The strategy paper is designed to enable the whole Executive,

                effectively, by establishing overall priorities for European
                work. That will assist the development of the policy priorities
                set out in the Programme for Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we are serious about using this strategy
                as a means of ensuring a co-ordinated and cohesive effort across
                all Departments, we must ensure their full involvement. That in
                itself has been a complex process. Departments must deal with
                different issues and different levels of activity. It is
                inevitable that delays will occur in the drawing up of a
                strategy to cover every Department. Departments face other

                is important that none of us forgets those who do not have
                anywhere to call home. Obviously, at Christmas those less
                fortunate than ourselves, including the homeless, are rightly
                prominent in our thoughts.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive recognise that housing support
                is particularly important for those who are homeless, not least
                at this time of the year. In order to reduce the plight of the
                homeless, the Housing Executive is spending approximately
                £11·5 million each year on homelessness services. In addition,
                the Housing Executive launched a review of its homelessness
                strategy and services in September 2001, with the purpose of
                improving services to the homeless in Northern Ireland.
                Consultation finishes at the end of this month, and the review
                is due to be completed in March 2002.</p>

                for allocations aimed specifically at tackling the problem of
                homelessness were received in the funding round I announced to
                the Assembly on Monday 3 December. We should not forget the
                valuable work done by a range of voluntary organisations for the
                homeless, and we take this opportunity to commend them for their
                year-round efforts to help the less fortunate.</p>

                Minister agree that the magnitude of the problem of homelessness
                manifests itself particularly at Christmas? Funding was

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Last year, following discussion between the
                Minister of Finance and Personnel and the Minister for Social
                Development, the Department for Social Development was able to
                announce a special allocation of funding to help those
                organisations and shelters providing particular measures at
                Christmas for the homeless. I can confirm that the Minister of
                Finance and Personnel and the current Minister for Social
                Development again discussed the point last week. I can assure
                the Member that the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy
                First Minister will encourage any measure this year similar to
                that which came forward last year. As was the case last year,
                any announcements would be for the Minister for Social
                Development to make.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My question has already been answered to some
                extent. I realise that the Deputy First Minister is somewhat
                hard-pressed with so many responsibilities today, which must be
                difficult. However, I would like him to give some thought to the
                question that I raised earlier in connection with the Executive
                programme funds. If homelessness were a priority — and we all
                know the terrible figures that have been recently released —
                would it be eligible for funding in the coming year under the
                Executive programme funds? Under normal policy, and indeed under
                TSN, is it not possible to categorise homelessness as a
                priority?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There would certainly be no grounds for
                anybody to say that homelessness, or measures to improve support
                to those who are homeless, would be ineligible for the Executive
                programme funds. Considering the range of funds available, one
                could possibly see bids in relation to some developments being
                considered under the social inclusion fund. Equally, certain
                measures aimed at directing some new services or measures to the
                problems of homeless people could be considered under the new
                directions fund. Nothing in the criteria for the Executive
                programme funds would rule out any such bid.</p>

                died as a result of the poverty trap. What steps will be taken
                to address that problem? Will the voluntary organisations

                themselves from board meetings could expect penalties to be

                Ireland. An increased allocation for roads next year is an
                example. We set aside £40 million over a number of years to
                ensure that the trans-European network from Larne to the border
                south of Newry is developed coherently. The &quot;dualling&quot;

                making a significant contribution to cross-border trade and

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Good governance requires systems of regional
                and local government that complement each other. We are
                conscious of the contribution made by councils to building local
                partnerships and embracing new challenges in areas such as
                economic development and community relations. As the Minister of
                the Environment told the Assembly on 12 November, the
                organisation of local government services will be considered in
                the context of the review of public administration.</p>

                the public sector, not just local government, will be launched
                in the spring. The Executive are working to finalise details of
                the review, and we are confident that we are on target. We hope
                to be in a position to provide the Assembly with draft terms of
                reference early in the new year.</p>

                these two reviews need to be dovetailed? It is difficult to see
                how public administration could be reorganised without taking
                account of the future size, geographical area and makeup of
                local councils. We have had statements from the Office of the
                First Minister and the Deputy First Minister on progress on the
                review of public administration, but we have heard very little
                on the review of local government. Does the Minister agree that
                it is necessary that these go hand-in- hand? Is he aware that
                the review of local government is being tailored to match the
                review of public administration?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister, the Minister of the
                Environment and I have reflected that the review of local
                government will proceed in the context of the wider review of
                public administration. We need to achieve a system of governance
                that allows regional government to play a part in developing
                policies and delivering programmes that are effective in meeting
                the needs of people. Similarly, it should also allow local
                government not just to deliver local government programmes, but
                to contribute to good regional government by delivering the
                local services and policy programmes that they are best placed
                to deliver. We can apply positive lessons and experiences from
                partnership working, not just in the European programmes, but in
                the different sectors as well. In the review of public
                administration we should not take a single tier of government in
                isolation, and no tier of government will drive the review.</p>

                pending review and the uncertainty that the Member has
                described. We are anxious to do what we can to ensure that there
                is no disruption to public services or to those who deliver them
                during the review. To that end, we are drawing up a
                comprehensive communications strategy to ensure that, throughout
                the process, information flows to everyone who may be affected.
                My Colleague, the Minister of the Environment, has informed the
                Executive of district councils’ concerns, and those are
                appreciated. In anticipation of the review, some councils are
                having difficulties with forward planning and managing
                resources, including filling new posts and staff vacancies.
                Completing the review and implementing its outcome will take
                time. During that period we will not be able to ameliorate all
                the concerns involved. It is accepted that review is needed, but
                we must proceed in a thoughtful and effective way, and that
                coherence will do most to deal with the uncertainty.</p>

                of Roads Service officials those objections have not been
                resolved. Therefore, public inquiries will have to take place.
                It is hoped that they will commence as early as possible in the

                shared by my Department’s Roads Service, which is equally
                eager to advance the scheme. However, the House recognises that
                individuals have rights, and it is important that people put
                forward a material objection to any roads proposal so that it
                can be thoroughly considered. If an objection cannot be dealt
                with through discussions with Roads Service officials, the
                matter should rightly be heard at an inquiry. In this case,
                there will be inquiries into a number of the features, and not

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for those comprehensive
                figures. I am sure that he, like myself, is mindful of the sad
                state of deterioration into which Northern Ireland’s railway
                stock was allowed to fall under direct rule, aggravated of
                course by terrorist action, community strife and reprehensible,
                wanton vandalism. Can the Minister assure the House that he
                supports, and will continue to support, a rolling programme of
                replacement for Northern Ireland’s public bus fleet, so that a
                similar deterioration does not take place under his stewardship?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I give an absolute assurance that I support
                that. Indeed, in the Department for Regional Development’s
                present programme approximately £1·7 million has been
                allocated for new buses in the current year and in the
                indicative figures for next financial year. The Member will be
                aware that about 50% of that funding for buses comes from the
                Department, and the other 50% comes from Translink. That gives a
                total of £3·4 million, which would purchase only about 28 new
                buses a year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the Member had asked about the replacement
                age of vehicles, I would have informed him that the Department
                believes that about 256 of Translink’s vehicles will be due
                for replacement by next March. The Department expects there to
                be a replacement age of 18 years for buses and 12 years for
                coaches. Therefore, while 256 vehicles need to be replaced by
                next March, we have a budget that will allow the replacement of
                only 28 buses. The House will therefore see that we are likely
                to drag further behind as time goes on unless there is a
                considerable uplift in the amount of money available for an
                increase in new fleet.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister indicated that over 1,000 buses
                are over five years old. Can he give any further details of the
                bus age beyond five years?</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I rather threw out the figures, so it was
                probably hard for the House to assimilate them quickly. There
                were 1,106 buses in total that were five years or older. That
                represents 76% of the fleet. However, there are 838 vehicles
                that are ten years or older, and that represents 57% of the
                fleet. As I indicated in reply to the earlier question, 256 of
                those are past the replacement age of 12 years for coaches and
                18 years for buses. The Member might also be interested to know
                that the oldest Ulsterbus is 23 years old.</p>

                the positive response that my free travel initiative has
                received. Free travel is enabling many older people to enjoy the

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister will know that many Members have
                been approached by war-disabled pensioners under the age of 65
                who are seeking the opportunity to take part in the free-fares
                scheme. Has the Minister considered the special case for their
                inclusion in the scheme?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker, I can assure the House
                that that was not a planted question. Of course, I find little
                to disagree with in the comments that were made in the Member’s
                question.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Just as in Castlereagh when the pilot scheme
                was carried out, the significant increase is not just a case of
                those who are taking passes out, which was what the original
                question was about. I am also told that Translink’s figures
                for the first month since the introduction of free travel show
                increases in the number of older people travelling to be in the
                region of 28% on Ulsterbus, up to 50% on Citybus and 35% on
                Northern Ireland Railways. That is a considerable uptake from
                senior citizens.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the point about war-disabled
                pensioners, they have always been considered as a special
                category as far as concessionary fares are concerned. They along
                with senior citizens over 65 enjoyed the concession of 50% up
                until the point when the over 65s were able to get free fares.
                Therefore war-disabled pensioners currently benefit from
                half-fare travel on public transport. I believe that they ought
                to be treated in the same way as retirement pensioners over 65
                years of age. Consequently, I am proposing that war-disabled
                pensioners under 65 be eligible for free travel alongside
                registered blind people and senior citizens over 65 years of
                age.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The resources required for this enhancement
                of the concessionary fare scheme are quite modest and should not
                prove to be a stumbling block. The legislation requires approval
                by the Department of Finance and Personnel. Therefore I have
                written to the Minister of Finance and Personnel seeking his
                agreement to introduce my proposal forthwith.</p>

                in the scheme. A similar statement has been made about another
                ferry service. If the ferry services are run by my Department,
                the only outstanding problem — that of the audit trail — is
                overcome. I am keen that free public transport, including
                transport on the ferries, should be enjoyed by those who are
                entitled to it. The problem goes beyond the ferries that are run
                by my Department, because the Department also funds some free
                fares for private operators, provided it is satisfied with their

                the pilot scheme. When I was involved in the Committee that
                supervised the pilot scheme, I got the impression that free
                travel means nothing unless there is an adequate bus service.
                That applies particularly to people living in the country, and
                work remains to be done to improve our rural bus service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to companions travelling with

                scheme over the next few months. It would be appropriate to
                extend the scheme to people with disabilities. Under the
                provisions of the Transport Act 2000, certain categories of
                disability receive a concessionary half-fare as a minimum in
                Great Britain. However, these categories are not covered by the
                scheme in Northern Ireland. That matter will receive urgent
                attention. Whether the scheme will extend to those who accompany
                disabled people will be a matter for consideration in the
                review.</p>

                have been reduced? My home town of Ballyclare is an example: the
                Saturday service has been removed completely. Why is free travel
                handed out with one hand and the bus service taken away with the

                Of course there would be an Executive, but it would not be a
                home-grown Executive. It was a Northern Ireland Office Minister
                who, after much pressure, agreed to have a pilot scheme for free
                fares. The scheme would have progressed whether it had been a
                Northern Ireland Executive or a UK Executive dealing with the
                matter. I am content that the DUP’s manifesto proposal for

                and I was told that the reductions were introduced because of
                service usage. If the Member will give me specific details of

                so many friends and supporters. As the Member might expect, only
                the newest buses will be suitably adapted to accommodate those
                with disabilities. I stress the point further by saying that the
                average age of the bus fleet in Northern Ireland is 13 years.
                The average age in Great Britain is eight years, and it is 4·7
                years in the Republic of Ireland. Therefore, there is
                considerable catching up to be done. If we are to have buses

                question, we are falling behind the rest of the United Kingdom
                in that regard.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am informed that the average age of the
                Republic of Ireland’s Expressway coach fleet is between four
                and five years. However, the average age of its city service
                fleet is around 2·5 years. That is a remarkably new fleet. The
                Transport Minister in the United Kingdom has set clear targets
                for an average age of eight years. At present, Northern Ireland’s
                average is 13 years. However, we are asking for buses that are
                18 years old and coaches that are 12 years old to be replaced.
                We cannot meet that target even under present Budget
                arrangements. No doubt, increased bids must be made to the
                Minister of Finance and Personnel.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that I can draw on the support of the
                House for a successful outcome to those bids. With regard to the
                Member’s comments about vandalism, the Department faces an
                uphill struggle with public transport in Northern Ireland. It is
                a disgrace that valuable resources are being wasted to repair
                damage caused by vandalism rather than being used to upgrade and
                update the fleet.</p>

                trains could be entering into service in Northern Ireland early
                in 2002. Will those trains be utilised on the busiest commuter
                routes, such as the east Antrim line, in order to benefit the
                maximum number of commuters and further encourage the use of
                public transport?</p>

                recently conveyed to Translink its approval for the purchase of
                23 new trains at a total cost of £87 million. The tendering
                process has been completed. The three tenders received are
                currently being evaluated. Translink hopes to be able to award
                the contract to a supplier in early 2002. Delivery of the first
                batch of 12 train sets for testing is envisaged by February
                2003, and delivery of the remaining 11 sets by September 2003.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Where those train sets are used when they

                everybody would see the benefits of the new trains. Consistent
                with the regional development strategy and, I expect, the
                regional transportation strategy that will soon be published, in
                Northern Ireland we are tasked with encouraging people to use
                public transport. That will not be possible unless public

                widening and resurfacing of the carriageway over approximately
                600 metres. The works are programmed to start early next month.
                Roads Service also has plans to undertake two other improvement

                resurfacing of the carriageway over approximately 900 metres.
                That scheme will cost somewhere in the region of £500,000 to
                £600,000. Subject to the acquisition of land and the
                availability of funds, Roads Service plans to commence the work

                visitors and others between two hospitals — the Erne Hospital
                in Enniskillen, and the Tyrone County Hospital in Omagh. I would

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People in Tyrone and Fermanagh have expressed
                concern about travel times and delays on that route, as certain
                health services are currently provided only at the Erne Hospital
                in Enniskillen or the Tyrone County Hospital in Omagh. The
                recent Hayes review of acute hospitals recommended Enniskillen
                as the location for a new acute hospital for the region. It is
                not for me to say whether that recommendation will be accepted,
                but the Department will undoubtedly continue to review the
                situation as and when that decision is taken.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department requires more funding for
                Roads Service to make further improvements to any road in
                Northern Ireland. As far as the A32 is concerned, the three
                schemes that I listed show that we recognise that as a priority.
                I hope that those schemes can proceed. If more funding becomes
                available, the Department will consider other schemes in the
                area. My predecessor, Mr Campbell, wrote to all Members in
                September asking if there was any scheme that they particularly
                wanted to be included in the 10-year forward programme; that was
                followed by a letter from Colin James, the chief executive of
                Roads Service. Perhaps surprisingly, there was no correspondence
                from the hon Member on that.</p>

                the possible improvement and upgrading of the existing route,
                which includes the Newry bypass, and a possible new route from

                advertising and consultation procedures.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The main policy guidance in this area is
                contained in ‘A planning strategy for rural Northern Ireland’,
                which states that all proposals for wind farms will be assessed
                in respect of their implications for the visual, ecological and
                historical landscapes. The implications for agriculture and the
                safety and amenity of local residents are also considered. It
                also makes clear that permission will not be granted in any
                location where there would be a seriously detrimental impact on
                the amenity of an area of outstanding natural beauty or any area
                that has been designated for its conservation, scientific,
                archaeological or historic interest.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Consultations on wind farm proposals normally

                Roads Service, the Ministry of Defence and the Civil Aviation

                where the hub height of any turbine or the height of any other
                structure is greater than 15 metres. Such a statement provides

                well aware of its natural beauty. It is the jewel in the
                Province’s crown. Several planning applications for wind farms
                in Fermanagh are being assessed by the Department of the
                Environment. The assessment, in appropriate circumstances,
                requires an environmental statement to evaluate the
                environmental impact of proposals.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All proposals for such development are
                assessed in respect of their implications for the visual,
                ecological and historical landscapes, and the implications for
                agriculture, the safety of local residents and the amenity of
                the area. I recognise, however, that wind farms have the
                potential to affect landscapes adversely. All practical measures
                should be taken to avoid or minimise that, and such measures
                will be included in any environmental statement required by my
                Department for such proposals.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It should, however, be pointed out that wind
                farms provide an alternative form of energy that does not
                involve the consumption of fossil fuels and the production of
                greenhouse gases. They do, therefore, deliver some environmental
                benefits.</p>

                application that came before Ards Borough Council, his
                Department allowed a small wind farm to be erected on the Lough

                Strangford Lough, which is an area of outstanding natural
                beauty. Despite my objections and concerns at the time, the

                earlier, under current regulations the Department of the

                proposal for a wind farm involves the installation of more than

                on its own merits. In some areas the applications are refused,

                the annual roadworthiness test, DVTA examiners check for the
                presence of a tachograph and whether it is working,
                appropriately calibrated and sealed. Compliance checks on
                tachograph charts on heavy goods vehicles and buses are carried
                out at the roadside and by random visits to premises to ensure
                that drivers comply with the requirements on driving and rest
                periods. The European Directive requires each member state to
                check a minimum of 1% of charts each year for compliance. In
                Northern Ireland that equates to over 48,000 checks. The DVTA
                has a target to carry out 20,000 of those. The remainder are
                carried out by the police as the main enforcement agency for
                tachograph charts. Last year, the Department of the Environment
                initiated enforcement proceedings in 397 cases, and 287 of those
                led to prosecution. As a result, fines totalling over £33,000
                were levied on operators and drivers.</p>

                are driving for 16 hours a day. Indeed, some companies blacklist

                seriously. The DVTA and the police are the relevant enforcement
                agencies. They carry out checks to ensure that drivers discharge
                their responsibilities properly by using tachographs in
                accordance with the statutory requirements, by not exceeding
                daily and fortnightly driving periods and by taking daily and
                weekly rest periods. Checks are carried out at operators’
                premises, as well as at the roadside.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The combined efforts of local road safety
                departments and agencies, including the police, have contributed
                to a significant reduction in deaths and serious injuries on our
                roads. Road fatalities are now at about half the level they were
                in the 1970s. There were approximately 4,000 fewer deaths and
                serious injuries in the period from 1989-2000 than if numbers
                had continued at the 1989 level.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nevertheless, the number of deaths and
                serious injuries on our roads remains totally unacceptable.
                Since devolution, I have successfully obtained additional
                resources to double the number of road safety education officers
                to work with schools, and I have substantially increased the
                budget for road safety advertising, resulting in new campaigns
                and additional airtime.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is gratifying to see that those campaigns,
                supplemented by police enforcement, are having a positive
                impact. For example, with increased seat belt wearing and
                improved road user attitudes, there have been 137 road deaths to
                date this year, compared to 155 for the same period last year.
                That reduction is very welcome but, as recent events show, more
                needs to be done.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have also initiated a wide debate on road
                safety through the publication of the ‘Road Safety Strategy
                2001-2010’ consultation document. Officials are considering
                the responses, and next spring I intend to publish a new 10-year
                strategic plan. However, the Government can do only so much. The
                key to achieving significant reductions in road casualties lies
                in more responsible road user behaviour. It will take the
                efforts of all to ensure that road users take personal
                responsibility for their safety and the safety of others.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for his response to that
                serious question. Can he confirm that, despite the recent spate
                of tragedies on the roads, the underlying long-term trend is
                downward? Will he join me in urging everyone to take special
                care in the run-up to Christmas so that more families are spared
                the terrible grief that such losses bring?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Mr McClarty for a special question
                and a very special statement; it is very important at this time.
                The Department’s anti-drink-driving campaign was launched
                about 10 days ago. Sadly, that afternoon there were three deaths
                in one road accident. It is always difficult and sad for those
                who lose a loved one, but especially so coming up to Christmas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To 9 December, 137 people have been killed on
                our roads this year. That compares to 155 in the same period in
                2000. Although fatalities in 2000 — 171 in total— were
                higher than in previous years, the long- term trend has been
                downward, despite the increase in the volume of traffic.
                Twenty-five years ago, more than 300 people were killed on the
                roads annually; for example, 355 were killed in 1977, while the
                average figure for the past five years is 150.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There will always be peaks and troughs in the
                numbers killed on the roads, and 1999 saw the lowest number of
                deaths — 141 — for over 40 years. While it is encouraging
                that the number of deaths and serious injuries this year remains
                lower than last year, the recent fatalities are tragic and serve
                to reinforce the need for all road users to take the utmost
                care, especially during the festive season.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On Saturday, at Colaghty Parish Church, in my
                home county of Fermanagh, I attended the funeral of the young
                couple killed on the local roads last week. It was a sad
                occurrence. Three people were buried on Saturday afternoon. My
                heart bleeds for those who have lost loved ones in such tragic
                circumstances. At such times I often think of the words of

                well as drink-driving? A Department of the Environment,
                Transport and the Regions report indicated that 18% of road
                accidents are attributed to drivers who have consumed drugs.
                That is a serious matter. What further action will the

                deals with the problem diligently. I am worried about it. One
                death is too many. Alcohol consumption remains a more serious
                problem than drugs as a cause of road deaths and serious
                injuries. There is no evidence yet to show that illegal drug use
                by drivers in Northern Ireland is a principal factor in causing
                crashes. I am aware of the increasing use of drugs among young
                drivers. Extensive research into drug-driving is being carried
                out in Great Britain. There are no current plans to carry out an
                anti-drug-driving campaign. However, I assure the Member that
                that will be kept under constant review.</p>

                plasterwork to investigate the condition of elements of the
                building and the affixing of ties to monitor the movement of the
                structure. At the rear of the church, props have been installed
                to provide structural support for the gallery. Most of the
                internal fixtures have been placed in secure storage. The pulpit
                and some pews remain in the building. The firm that carried out
                the investigation has recommended that a structural engineer be

                everything covered by the protection of the Department of the

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the church has been deconsecrated, it no
                longer enjoys ecclesiastical exemption from listed building
                consent. Any works of alteration, extension or demolition will
                require my Department’s approval. However, there was no
                requirement for listed building consent for the works that have
                been carried out to date because they were purely investigative
                and were in the interest of the safety of the structure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My officials are aware of the works, but were
                not formally consulted because listed building consent was not
                required. However, the nature of the work was confirmed when
                officials from Environment and Heritage Service recently met the
                parish priest, Fr David White, on site. The interior fixtures
                were removed for safe keeping when the building was still a

                Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science to take samples
                and analyse sea water, fish, shellfish, seaweed and sediments on
                the bed of the Irish Sea. That work has been ongoing since the
                early 1950s. Northern Ireland’s results consistently reveal
                minimal amounts of radioactivity at levels that are consistent
                with normal background levels. Those results are published in
                the ‘Radioactivity in Food and the Environment’ annual
                report. They also appear in the Northern Ireland digest of
                statistics. People in Northern Ireland receive an average of
                2,500 microsieverts of radiation a year from natural and
                artificial sources. Exposure to radon in the home accounts for
                50% of that total, with 12% coming from medical exposure.
                Nuclear discharges account for less than 0·1%. A recent study
                undertaken in collaboration with the Radiological Protection
                Institute of Ireland and University College Dublin on
                radioactivity levels in Strangford Lough shows that the
                radiation dose from artificial radioactivity is of negligible

                range of potential safety risks from the operation of the MOX
                plant, which we have just referred to. As I said in last week’s

                Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to seek
                confirmation that all relevant risks were fully taken into
                account in the MOX decision. Their reply pointed to those parts
                of the decision document that dealt with the safety, security,
                environmental and health issues, and, in particular, to the
                advice from the Office for Civil Nuclear Security. I have since
                written to Margaret Beckett, Secretary of State for Environment,
                Food and Rural Affairs, with a copy to Patricia Hewitt at the

                the sixth response on Sellafield in the Chamber this afternoon,
                which is very welcome indeed. Will the Minister take on board
                the fact that there were two prerequisite elements for the
                licensing of the MOX plant that were not covered in his reply?
                First, the Health and Safety Executive had not reported before
                the licence was granted. Secondly, he completely omitted the
                economic case, which is also a requirement of the European
                Atomic Energy Community (EURATOM). That was omitted
                deliberately, because it is infeasible.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister is the one person who can drive
                this on behalf of the House. Will he assure the House that he
                will be proactive in representing last week’s debate and today’s
                questions? He must ensure, in co-operation with all relevant
                parties, that the British Government are made fully aware. The
                strongest possible expression of discontent, to put it mildly,
                must be made to them, and we must be proactive.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Department has received papers from the
                Welsh Office on the best value process in Wales, including
                details of the plans to review that process over the next few
                months. I have also spoken to my counterpart in the Welsh
                Assembly, Edwina Hart, the Minister for Finance, Local
                Government and Housing, to learn at first hand what the review
                is likely to address. My understanding of the position is that
                the principles underlying the statutory framework for best value
                in Wales are not being questioned. Rather, the review will
                address details of its implementation and arrangements for its
                scrutiny. The broad objective of the review is to provide a
                workable model for best value in Wales that will give practical
                effect to the existing framework within current statutory
                provisions. Following a consultation process, the review group
                aims to have revised guidance in place by 1 April 2002.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Local Government (Best Value) Bill
                currently before the Assembly includes five clauses that provide

                Welsh counterpart, the Minister will take this issue seriously
                and reconsider the process of introducing statutory best value
                to Northern Ireland, which he is currently engaged in. The Bill
                appears to be inappropriate at this time, and it does not have
                the support of the local authorities or the unions that
                represent those working in local authorities. It has already
                cost local authorities an immense amount of money. Much valuable
                staff time has been tied up in the operation of voluntary best
                value, and much more of that time — which could be put to
                better use — will be tied up in the operation of statutory
                best value.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Best value is designed as a framework within
                which councils should deliver local services according to the
                wishes of residents and ratepayers, at a price that they are
                willing to pay. People are entitled to know how their council is

                plans the council has for local services.</p>

                residents and users of council services. Equally, the Assembly,
                with its preponderance of district councillors, should not allow
                its judgement to be clouded by the wishes of councillors at the
                expense of the views of local people, who deserve value for
                money and who are entitled to transparency and accountability in
                local service provision. Openness and transparency are vital

                Does the Minister agree that there should be a robust public
                accountability framework for local government, as there is for

                beyond my remit as Minister of the Environment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Central Government already operates a type of
                best value framework. Indeed, in many ways, it is more rigorous
                than the best value framework that I propose for district
                councils. It includes the Programme for Government, public
                service agreements, published departmental and agency corporate
                and business plans, the work of the Northern Ireland Audit
                Office, value for money studies and the work of the Public
                Accounts Committee and other Statutory Committees of the

                government, and it would be too burdensome for local government
                as presently structured. The Local Government (Best Value) Bill,
                on the other hand, is designed to fit the specific circumstances

                funding for the Health Service, waiting lists continue to
                lengthen. Bed blocking is also continuing to increase, and
                facilities for people with learning difficulties are being
                stretched to the limits. Cancer service problems and problems
                with other services must be tackled immediately. Our sick people
                deserve better, and with the funding that is going in, they
                expect better.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, I am relieved that free nursing care
                is to be provided — the sooner, the better. I hope that the
                necessary legislation will come along shortly; we do not want to
                see any delays. There is real disappointment because free
                personal care is not being provided for. I appeal to the
                Executive to work extremely hard on that as soon as possible.
                One section of care is as important as the other, and this needs
                urgent attention.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is deep disappointment that the
                Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety’s
                request for funding for free digital aids for people with
                hearing difficulties has not, to my knowledge, been granted.
                Again, the disabled are left to suffer. If the Executive are to
                mean anything, they must listen and act as far as humanly
                possible to assist everyone to have confidence in the National
                Health Service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are many other concerns to do with
                health and other areas of daily living, and Eileen Bell spoke
                about some of them earlier. My party leader, David Ford, will
                shortly follow with what the Alliance Party feels needs in-depth
                attention. I support the amendment.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Fee:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion and reject the
                amendment. This, the second Programme for Government, goes a
                long way towards addressing the Executive’s stated priorities.
                It also makes a good stab at tackling divisions and inequalities
                in society. It goes a long way towards delivering the new
                beginning envisaged by the Good Friday Agreement. As the second
                home-grown Programme for Government agreed by the Executive,
                this is another extraordinary document and an extraordinary
                achievement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not going to speak at great length. The
                debate has ranged across many wide areas, policies and services.
                One comment that the Deputy First Minister made earlier struck
                me and illustrates one element of this programme which is deeply
                frustrating. The phrase he used was &quot;consultation
                fatigue&quot;. On page 29 of the Programme for Government the
                Executive have committed themselves to ensuring that</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;any new configurations of hospital
                services are supported by a modern and effective Ambulance
                Service, delivered through a programme of targeted investment
                and change based on the implementation proposals now
                published.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I can only assume that the implementation
                proposals are those contained in the report of the strategic
                review of the Ambulance Service, which was published last month
                by the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety.
                I use the words &quot;consultation fatigue&quot; because the
                implementation paper has &quot;consultation paper&quot; written
                all over it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will put the proposals in context: in 1998,
                the Department first set up a team to review the Ambulance
                Service. That review group reported on 25 February 2000 and then
                began a consultation exercise, which lasted until 30 June. It
                took until November 2000 to establish an implementation steering
                group. A year later, in November this year, that steering group
                published its implementation strategy. Four years since the
                review began the Minister still refers to it as a consultation
                exercise. I find that consultation fatigue is setting in, and
                that must also be the case for those who are failed, not by the
                ambulance staff and paramedics, but by the service and its
                organisation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">According to the current targets for response
                times, the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service should respond to
                50% of all emergency calls within eight minutes, and to 95% of
                all emergency calls in the Eastern Health and Social Services
                Board area within 18 minutes, or within 21 minutes in the other
                three board areas. The Executive should take on board that the
                vast majority of my constituency, and of most rural
                constituencies, cannot be reached from a hospital or ambulance
                station within eight minutes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A substantial portion of Northern Ireland
                cannot be reached within the 18- or 21-minute response time.
                Among those areas are the whole south Armagh border, from
                Cullaville to Crossmaglen, through Keady to Middletown, vast
                tracks of the Clogher Valley, including Augher, parts of
                Fermanagh, and, until recently, parts of County Down and County
                Antrim. In an emergency, large sections of our community cannot
                be reached within the agreed safe response times for ambulance
                provision.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since the implementation proposals are
                mentioned so specifically in the Programme for Government, and
                since they have now been published, will the Executive get on
                with the job of implementing them? I am not asking for a single
                extra penny for this service. Reorganisation could achieve
                savings, while creating the response times and the emergency
                services that we all want.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Every other emergency service — such as the
                fire, police and coastguard services — is centrally funded.
                The Ambulance Service has 800 staff in four operational
                divisions, which work in four health board areas. The boards
                commission urgent ambulance services, and in the Eastern Health
                and Social Services Board area the eight local trusts commission
                the Ambulance Service. Why is the service not funded centrally
                in the same way as other emergency services? Imagine the layers
                of bureaucracy that could be bypassed, the money that could be
                saved and reinvested in the emergency appliances and the
                training of the specialist staff who man them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My plea to the Executive is not to allocate
                money from a certain budget, nor to rewrite the Programme for
                Government. After almost four and a half years of consultation,
                I plead that they put an end to the dithering and implement,
                without further delay, what is clearly stated on page 29 of
                their programme.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Committee of the
                Centre (Mr Poots):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In answer to my question of 3 December on the
                state of forward planning in relation to the review of public
                administration and the children’s commissioner, Mr Durkan
                indicated that he had previously responded to questions about
                these matters. That is correct, but it does not mean that the
                responses were adequate. He should not therefore be surprised
                that I will be returning to those matters. They are matters of
                concern to the Committee of the Centre, and I hope that the
                Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister
                understands that I will continue to raise them until they are
                dealt with satisfactorily.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In its response to the Office of the First
                Minister and the Deputy First Minister on the draft Programme
                for Government, the Committee of the Centre expressed concern
                about the approach to forward planning there and the lack of
                specific or measurable targets for a number of areas. The junior
                Ministers advised that it might not be possible to have
                quantified time-bounded targets in place in every case. This may
                help explain why the closest target we have been given for the
                launch of the review of public administration is spring 2002.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The House may be interested to note that
                according to the Collins English Dictionary spring is defined as
                the period from the March equinox to the June solstice in the
                northern hemisphere, or from the September equinox to the
                December solstice in the southern hemisphere. Given the lapse
                that has taken place, let us hope that the Office of the First
                Minister and the Deputy First Minister realise that we are in
                the northern hemisphere and not the southern and that we will
                have a review of public administration within the next six
                months.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have already waited for two years for a
                review. It was a priority for the leader of the Ulster Unionist
                Party, Mr Trimble. When the eleven Departments were set up, we
                were told that a review would help offset the costs of having
                additional Departments. We should remember that Northern Ireland
                costs £80 million more to administer now than it did before the
                signing of the Belfast Agreement. Administration costs are much
                higher than they were pre-April 1998. That issue must be
                addressed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In June the Committee of the Centre was
                advised of the main issues under consideration with regard to a
                review. Should the approach be strategic or overarching, or
                should it take the form of a series of independent departmental
                reviews of individual sectors? Should it cover all functions at
                local, sub-regional and central levels? Was the most appropriate
                mechanism for taking it forward internal, external or a
                combination of these? What principles should guide the direction
                of the review? Should it be one all-encompassing review, or a
                review of the principles of public administration followed by a
                series of linked reviews of different sectors? How should the
                timing be phased?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In June of this year consideration was still
                being given to what the terms of reference should be. I had
                hoped that by now we would have had those, but I have not been
                advised that this is so. The Committee was advised that it would
                receive a further report when progress was made on these issues.
                Members may be surprised to learn that no such report has yet
                been sent to the Committee. In view of the approach to forward
                planning taken by the Office of the First Minister and the
                Deputy First Minister, I am not surprised.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In paragraph 7.5 of the Programme for
                Government we are told that</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The Executive remains committed to
                improving the efficiency and effectiveness of and accountability
                for, the administration and delivery of public services in
                Northern Ireland. We recognise the need for different structures
                under devolution, taking account of new relationships between
                local and regional government, as well as the full range of
                other bodies that function within the wider public sector. We
                are committed to a comprehensive and strategic review of all
                aspects of the public sector.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In a press statement following a meeting of
                the Executive on 14 November, the public was advised that at
                that meeting the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister
                introduced a discussion paper on the review of public
                administration. When are the Assembly and, indeed, the relevant
                Committee going to be advised of the content of the discussion
                paper?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What progress, if any, has been made since
                June? This is one of the most important cross-cutting issues
                that the Assembly will have to tackle, and it is one that could
                deliver significant efficiency benefits and cost savings. As the
                Minister of Finance and Personnel proposes a significant rise in
                the regional rate and one considers the additional burden that
                has been put upon ratepayers, a review of public administration
                will show where £4 million of savings, which would keep the
                rate rise to the level of inflation, might come from.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The way in which the Office of the First
                Minister and the Deputy First Minister has handled that does not
                inspire me with confidence. If that is its approach to such a
                vital task, how can the Assembly be assured that it will deliver
                on the other important cross-cutting issues set out in the
                Programme for Government, such as the community relations
                strategy and the victims strategy, both of which have slipped
                from the original dates that were set for them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee of the Centre and many Members
                attach a great deal of importance to the appointment of a
                children’s commissioner. Sub-priority 4 of section two of the
                Programme for Government says that the Executive aim to protect
                children’s rights, meet children’s needs and include
                children’s voices. The Programme states that</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Children need the support of society to
                ensure that their right to a safe, happy and fulfilling
                childhood is respected and promoted.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No Members would disagree, but the Programme
                for Government sets June 2002 as its target for the appointment
                of a children’s commissioner. The Committee of the Centre
                carried out an inquiry into the appointment of a commissioner
                earlier this year. The Committee’s report was debated and
                approved by the Assembly on 26 June. In responding to the debate
                the junior Minister said that</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The appointment of a children’s
                commissioner is one of the most significant and exciting things
                to occur since devolution.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He advised that the legislation should be
                introduced to the Assembly early in the new year. I understand
                that that may happen in February. Even allowing for a smooth
                passage through all the stages, it is likely to take three to
                four months for the Bill to go through the Assembly, and it may
                be May next year before the legislation is finally in place. Can
                the Ministers explain how a children’s commissioner will be in
                place for June 2002? Will they also confirm if the appointment
                will be made in accordance with the procedures for public
                appointments? Will the Ministers explain why they continue to
                set unrealistic targets in the Programme for Government that
                unfairly raise the expectations of the public — particularly
                the expectations of the most disadvantaged and vulnerable groups
                and individuals in society?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some concerns about the equality impact
                assessment on the Programme for Government were drawn to the
                Committee’s attention. Paragraph 1.11 of annexe D states that
                the Executive recognise that much of their work</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;has significant implications for
                equality of opportunity&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">and that they are</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;committed to ensuring that this is
                fully taken into account as we progress our work&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However in paragraph 1.9 we are advised that</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;it is not practicable to properly
                assess the equality impact of the various sub-priorities nor of
                the overall Programme for Government&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Reliance is instead to be placed on the
                individual equality impact assessments carried out on various
                policies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That approach has various weaknesses. It will
                not pick up the impact of combined policies; it will not
                identify ways to promote the equality of opportunity through
                joined-up Government; and it places particular emphasis on the
                quality of individual assessments — and the Committee of the
                Centre has drawn the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy
                First Minister’s attention to deficiencies there. The equality
                impact assessments identify adverse impact rather than focus on
                positive ways to promote equality of opportunity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the Office of the First Minister and the
                Deputy First Minister reflect on those comments and consider if
                there is any way in which the deficiencies in its approach can
                be addressed?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr M Murphy:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.
                The Health Service is in crisis because it has had no one to
                care for it. At last, we have a Minister who knows what she is
                doing and who is slowly but surely evaluating the performance of
                all the separate parts of the Health Service — hospitals,
                primary care, ambulances, health promotion and education.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, there are two fundamental facts that
                we cannot change in the short term. The Health Service has been
                starved of hundreds of millions of pounds over the past 30
                years. The Thatcherite agenda has created a culture of
                bureaucracy. The internal market and the trusts have taken money
                from front-line services; an added complication is the lack of
                nurses and doctors.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At last, the Executive have begun to respond
                to the Minister’s demands for more cash. They have had to;
                across every political party and throughout every community the
                demand was clear — give the Health Service more money.
                However, we must be careful, now that we are taking faltering
                steps, that we do not demand the unreasonable.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motives of the motion are very clear, but
                much more spend would be invisible and improvements slow. Junior
                doctors are working more civilised hours — and they are safer.
                However, productivity has been cut. Registrars no longer operate
                alone; surgeons supervise them — again a cut in productivity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the problems is that politicians
                cannot wait; they will not let the changes be explored and
                bedded down and allowed to work. The scale of the long-term
                underfunding cannot and should not be underestimated. During the
                lifetime of the Assembly, Mr Durkan has allocated the Minister
                only a fraction of the resources that she has bid for. This is
                the responsibility of the Executive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The trusts that were created to facilitate
                the internal markets have also had considerable problems in
                managing their budgets. It is true that a portion of new money,
                in some cases, has gone to meet health trust defects. Go raibh

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Audit Committee (Mr
                Dallat):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not propose any radical changes to the
                programme. Clearly, any programme necessitates choices, but it
                also involves good housekeeping to ensure that the public gets
                value for money.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since the end of direct rule, the Public
                Accounts Committee has dealt with several disturbing reports
                prepared by the Comptroller and Auditor General that clearly
                show that in the past, and particularly during direct rule, the
                public did not get good value for money — far from it. The
                Minister has clearly said that there will be no tolerance of
                Departments that do not clearly demonstrate that they have
                managed their finances well, and of course this is most welcome.
                However, much public expenditure is not controlled directly by
                the Departments but by a whole variety of quangos, and here the
                public auditor has produced several highly disturbing reports
                that show that there has been little regard for proper
                accountancy practices.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since the last report on the Programme for
                Government there have been important improvements to how
                spending of public finances is recorded and accounted for; I
                refer of course to the Government Resources and Accounts Act
                (Northern Ireland) 2000.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would welcome an assurance from the
                Minister that he will leave no stone unturned in his
                determination to clean out all bad practices in how public money
                is expended. Ultimately, this can only mean that the public will
                get more services within the constraints of the resources
                available. I would go further and ask that we do all that we can
                to measure the quality of the services provided and to ensure
                that where serious deficiencies exist they are rooted out
                without delay. However, I should like to see recognition for
                success.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To date, it has not been shown that there is
                a quick response to unnecessary waste or a fast track to stem
                it. I would welcome an undertaking from the Minister that the
                findings of the public accounts reports will be much more than
                historical records of past events and are in fact alarm bells
                for all that there is no tolerance of waste or of substandard
                service being delivered to the public.</p>

                of the Assembly by the way in which we conduct our income and
                expenditure and the level of service we provide. It must be
                clearly understood that the bad practices that crept in during
                direct rule are gone forever.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs I Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While every Department has a genuine case for
                claiming to be underfunded, there is little doubt that the one
                single area of local government most in need of investment is
                the Health Service. No other area of local life has seen such
                decline over the past few years, and the challenge must be met
                head-on to prevent further disintegration of healthcare across
                the Province.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The provision of cancer care requires urgent
                financial assistance — the local service is rated as one of
                the poorest in Europe. It was encouraging to hear last week’s
                announcement that an extra £41 million is to be ploughed into
                the Health Service. It has, however, been acknowledged that that
                may not be sufficient to maintain the level of healthcare
                currently required. While it is not all that we wanted, it must
                be of some comfort to patients whose treatment has been
                postponed or suspended. I am glad that £12·4 million of that
                provision is to be allocated to the coronary and cancer fields.
                The Programme for Government states categorically that there
                will be a focus on modernising and improving hospital and
                primary care services to ensure more timely and effective care
                and treatment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The current state of our cancer services is
                exacerbated by the state of the equipment and machinery being
                used to deliver the services. It is old, outdated, inefficient
                and in need of urgent replacement. It is with horror that I note
                that there is not one single reference to investment in cancer
                care services in the programme. There are only two references to
                the disease — one in section 3.2, where it states that</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;While deaths from heart disease are
                falling among those under 75, cancer deaths have been increasing
                and are likely to become the main cause of death in the coming
                years. We will therefore maintain a focus on prevention and
                treatment of cancer and heart disease.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A second reference is to the demand for
                essential drugs in the fight against cancer, in paragraph 3.6.
                Providing access to cardiac surgery for an additional 150 people
                by March 2003 is referred to, yet there is no mention of the
                provision for cancer care. I find that illogical, indefensible
                and ill thought out. Last year, 31% of eligible women had not
                had a cervical screening test in the previous five years, and
                28% of women aged between 50 and 64 had not had a breast
                screening test in the previous three years. Primary care
                services vigorously promote the concept of healthy living but
                lack both the finance and the resources to enable that goal to
                be fulfilled.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Health Service must be able to provide
                rapid diagnosis followed by speedily planned and implemented
                treatment and support for patients. As things stand, patients
                are all too often forced to wait too long to see a specialist,
                delaying diagnosis and treatment. That delay and the
                inefficiencies of cancer equipment are causing untold and
                unnecessary anxiety for patients. It does not maximise the
                potential of the Health Service to treat conditions properly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People often have no option but to travel to
                Belfast for treatment, rather than be treated locally, thus
                adding to their stress. At present there are no haematologists
                in the Western Board area, and that forces patients to travel to
                Belfast. The recent resignation of a radiologist at Antrim
                Hospital has caused delays in diagnosis. Attracting and keeping
                qualified staff is an ongoing difficulty. Better financial
                support across the Health Service would benefit many needy
                people. That must be addressed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am also disappointed to note that there is
                no reference in the Programme for Government to investment in
                maternity services. Following the farce that was the review of
                maternity services in Belfast, it is incredible that there is no
                mention of the new maternity hospital.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am glad that the Department has finally
                realised that failure to provide adequate aftercare services has
                resulted in the system backing up to the point at which
                ambulances have had to be used for patients in accident and
                emergency departments. More than 70 beds in the Ulster Hospital
                are being used by patients who should not be in hospital. The
                lack of community care services continues to be the reason for
                bed blocking, not only in the Ulster Hospital but throughout the
                Province’s acute hospitals. More than 12 patients waiting for
                operations on life-threatening brain tumours were forced out of
                the Royal Victoria Hospital for the same reason. Until that
                problem is properly addressed, services will stumble from one
                crisis to another.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The long-term care of the elderly is an issue
                that has gathered great momentum over the past few weeks and
                months — rightly so. Elderly citizens in Northern Ireland must
                stand idly by as services in Scotland, England and Wales are
                enhanced. The Health and Social Care Act 2001 splits care into
                two parts: nursing care and personal care. In England, residents
                will not receive funding for personal care, but they will
                receive up to £35, £70 or £110 per week for nursing care,
                depending on individual circumstances. In Wales, all residents
                qualify for £90 per week for nursing care, but, again, they do
                not receive assistance for personal care. In Scotland, residents
                receive up to £65 per week for nursing care and up to £90 per
                week for personal care, while all personal care is free for
                those living at home.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should compare all that to what is
                provided in Northern Ireland — absolutely nothing. Residents
                of Northern Ireland receive zilch for nursing care or personal
                care. Although the Department appears to be committed to free
                care in principle, it was forced to admit that it could not
                afford to provide that assistance. In any case, that commitment
                relates only to nursing care and not to personal care, which
                constitutes the bulk of care costs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The elderly in this country have been
                relegated to the status of second-class citizens. Although the
                commitment to provide free nursing care by October 2002 is
                welcome, elderly citizens are not best served by having the cost
                of care split into nursing and personal sections. The state
                should be responsible for nursing and personal costs. Until such
                times, elderly citizens will get a bad deal from the Assembly. I
                hope that Ministers will take those views on board.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms McWilliams:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members who had the opportunity to look at
                this afternoon’s ‘Belfast Telegraph’ will have seen that a
                major report has been published in the UK called ‘Monitoring
                Poverty and Social Exclusion’. That report is the result of a
                large-scale survey carried out by the New Policy Institute and
                the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. It responds to the UK Government’s
                ambitious programme for eradicating poverty and shows that
                results relating to 24 out of 50 indicators improved last year.
                That is the good news. Results for eight of those poverty
                indicators have become worse, and the rest have remained steady.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report goes on to say that there are
                still four million children and a total of 13·3 million people
                living in poverty, which it defines as less than 60% of the
                average household income.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report’s conclusion is that the UK
                Government have made a slow start in their ambitious programme,
                but at least they have made a start. I would have thought that,
                on opening the Programme for Government, we could see what kind
                of start we have made in Northern Ireland. After the publication
                of the first Programme for Government, I asked whether the
                Executive had a research base for the indicators for child
                poverty — if not for family poverty — in Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I still ask that question. Despite the
                Programme for Government’s targets, we will not know in
                Northern Ireland whether we are doing better, staying steady, or
                getting worse, unless we can come to some answers, in the way
                that the Joseph Rowntree Foundation and the New Policy Institute
                were able to do by evaluating the ambitious programme set down
                by the Government at Westminster. Until we have that
                information, we can continue to set different targets in each
                new programme, but all we are doing is monitoring different
                things each time. The questions that I often ask are: what is in
                it, and what is not in it? I will continue to ask those
                questions until there is some indication of whether we are going
                up, staying steady or going down.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Despite the excellent report from the
                Committee for Finance and Personnel, reliance on private finance
                initiatives is being put forward as the only way forward. There
                should have been some criteria in the Programme for Government
                stating that that may not be the most appropriate way to proceed
                and that partnerships could be sought elsewhere. I would like to
                have seen a greater emphasis on private, public and voluntary
                partnerships, rather than the argument that private finance
                initiatives are the only way to proceed in Northern Ireland. We
                have learnt a great deal from the partnerships that have existed
                with regard to the social economy. However, there is little with
                regard to that in the Programme for Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The programme makes a sweeping statement on
                external relations, suggesting that Northern Ireland is a model
                for conflict resolution. I am not convinced that we have even
                started the process of conflict transformation. The Executive of
                Northern Ireland are targeted with conflict management. Through
                the management of that conflict, Northern Ireland may have
                become a good model for elsewhere. However, if we are ever going
                to achieve conflict resolution, we should be mindful of what we
                have not done well. What is happening on the streets and in the
                communities of north Belfast, for example, shows us how far we
                still have to go.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The duplication of services and lack of
                integration in Northern Ireland increases the amount of money
                that we spend each year — whether it is to provide separate
                facilities for housing, education, or health, depending on the
                location of local health surgeries. If we are to address
                genuinely the problems that we have faced in the past 30 years,
                that should have been an interdepartmental theme in the
                programme. The Civic Forum made a good point when it stated that
                the section titled ‘Growing as a Community’ should have been
                titled ‘Tackling Inter-Communal Division’. The alternative
                is the promotion of equality and inclusion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with Iris Robinson about the problems
                that we still face with regard to health. Despite the extra
                finance that the Health Service in Northern Ireland has
                received, there has been no real increase. Therein lies the
                problem. The percentage of the block grant has remained at 40%
                this year; it will go down to less than 39% next year, and it
                will be just over 38% the following year. That is a major issue
                that should be addressed. It is good to see that the Department
                of Health, Social Services and Public Safety has increased its
                targets from eight in the draft programme to 22 in the revised
                programme, because it has the highest departmental budget.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, if the percentage of the block grant
                remains at 40%, the Health Service will not do well. Free
                nursing care for the elderly has already been put forward as an
                example of a promise that was held out and then pulled back, and
                then restored, but only with effect from October 2002.</p>
                <i>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am enormously concerned that the Personal
                Social Services (Amendment) Bill, which should have been
                considered by the Committee for Health, Social Services and
                Public Safety, has not been introduced. The Executive should
                have explained in the Programme for Government why that is so.
                The public do not know that, unless the legislation is passed,
                we may be unable to give out that money next October. To date,
                no member of the Committee has seen the legislation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The personal social services legislation is
                now going to relate only to nursing care, and not to personal
                care. Those in the communities that came here today,
                particularly the elderly, are extremely concerned that the
                Executive held out a promise that they are unable to deliver
                until October of next year. The promise carries a large health
                warning — the legislation may not be in place by next October.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Once again, mental health services have not
                been prioritised. Professionals working in that sector have come
                here to talk about the troubled mind and the impact that 30
                years of conflict have had on children in Northern Ireland. That
                could have been an integrated theme for cross-departmental work,
                yet it is barely mentioned in the specific programme on health.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The new regional maternity hospital, which
                will be located in Belfast, is not mentioned in the Programme
                for Government either. The dire consequences are that the main
                regional neonatal hospital must turn children away because there
                are not enough cots or intensive care nurses to cope with
                children who are seriously ill after birth.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unfortunately, in the Programme for
                Government, childcare is simply mentioned and then passed over.
                The message from programmes in other regions of the UK, and the
                Republic of Ireland, is that a child out of a nursery is a woman
                out of a job. Until that ceases to be the case, numeracy and
                literacy levels will continue to be poor because children fall
                behind if they do not get a head start — both in education and
                care. I pay tribute to John Dallat for raising the issue of
                numeracy and literacy so many times in the House.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is with some concern that I address the
                Programme for Government. It is not enough to talk about
                investing in education and skills, or about working for a
                healthier people, when, throughout the programme, insufficient
                attention is paid to cross-departmental projects and programmes.
                On reading the document, one must ask which particular project
                has truly been highlighted for implementation on a
                cross-departmental basis.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My final concern is about where our legal
                obligations under the European Directives are addressed in the
                Programme for Government. Have specific targets been set? We
                have fallen far behind in meeting targets, particularly in
                environmental policy. Will we have to pay money because those
                obligations have not been met? If that were the case, what would
                the Executive’s intentions be to actually meet some of their
                obligations in the next few years?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister for Employment and Learning (Dr
                Farren):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am pleased to have the opportunity to
                contribute to the debate and to address some issues in the
                Programme for Government that my Department is responsible for.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proposed amendment asserts that the
                Programme for Government does not adequately or satisfactorily
                address the inequalities and divisions within our society.
                Obviously, the programme does not provide all the answers in
                relation to those areas under my responsibility, but,
                nonetheless, many initiatives for which I am responsible are
                specifically directed towards addressing some of the
                inequalities, lack of opportunities and divisions within our
                society.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I take very seriously the whole issue of
                social justice. A profound sense of social justice must inform
                our entire approach to the Programme for Government and its
                implementation. As we prioritise the particular initiatives in
                the various Departments’ responsibilities, high on the list
                must be the needs of the most disadvantaged in our society —
                those who have least resources and opportunities. Insofar as
                resources, initiatives and programmes can meet their needs,
                disadvantages and lack of opportunities, we must be seen to do
                so effectively.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the theme of investing in education and
                skills, considerable progress in several respects can be
                recorded on the targets and initiatives that have been set, and
                some degree of positive achievement in making a difference can
                be identified. That whole theme is highlighted in the key
                priorities of the Programme for Government. It makes it clear
                that the Executive are determined to ensure that people in all
                sections of our society have the opportunities for education and
                training that will equip them to participate in the labour
                market in ways that will enable them to gain worthwhile and
                fulfilling forms of employment. In developing those initiatives
                and programmes, the Executive will ensure that people will be
                able to realise their personal potential with respect to their
                talents; that they will be supported to the best of our ability;
                and that no one will be marginalised or ignored.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the important initiatives currently
                under way is the work of the task force on employability and
                long-term unemployment. I trust that Ms McWilliams will note
                that it is clear evidence of a cross-departmental approach to
                key issues. The task force was established in the spring of this
                year, and it has been engaged since then in a wide range of
                consultations with many sectors in our society, from employers
                to trade unions and voluntary and community groups.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms McWilliams:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Minister accept that the public and
                some Assembly Members — although welcoming the task force on
                employability — might be disappointed that a genuine
                partnership, as was suggested in the Programme for Government,
                was not really built among those in the various sectors who deal
                with the issue of unemployment daily? Instead, the Minister
                chose to use officials from Departments, albeit — and rightly
                so — from across all of the Executive Departments. However,
                professionals and the unemployed themselves were absent from
                that task force.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Farren:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am happy to address that point. It is not a
                point that has been made to us by the various groups that we
                have met. This morning, in co-operation with the Northern
                Ireland Association for the Unemployed, I had a very useful and
                positive meeting with a group of long-term unemployed people
                drawn from across Northern Ireland, and they were able to tell
                me of their own experiences. With them I was able to identify
                some of the initiatives and action plans on which our
                recommendations are likely to be based when the task force
                reports, early in the new year, I hope.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The range of community organisations that my
                officials and I met was such that we have had a most
                comprehensive form of consultation and engagement. The
                Department received a significant input and response from across
                the sector. Therefore, I can assure Ms McWilliams that the
                engagement that she suggests is necessary took place as recently
                as this morning. I trust that when the Department comes to make
                its final report, it will have an effective set of
                recommendations and action plans to put to Colleagues in the
                Executive and the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The initiative on student financial support
                has received much public attention. At a further education
                college recently, I spoke to students who had benefited from the
                implementation of the first stage of the new package of
                financial support. They told me that were it not for the
                benefits that are now available, they would have found it
                impossible to avail of further and higher education. The group
                that I spoke to included women who had left school many years
                ago, some leaving with no formal qualifications. They can now
                avail of new opportunities to acquire qualifications and skills
                because of the new childcare allowances and the remission on
                fees. The residual threshold has been raised from £17,000 to
                £20,000, thus enabling many more students to avail of those
                opportunities because they no longer have to make the
                contribution to fees.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Together with the provision of additional
                places in higher education, the first benefits to widen
                opportunities are being put in place. In particular, that helps
                those from low-income backgrounds to participate in higher
                education and provides opportunities for more students to avail
                of higher education in Northern Ireland rather than having to
                migrate elsewhere.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">From next September, bursaries will be
                available via maintenance support for low-income students. Those
                bursaries will further strengthen the support that has been made
                available since the review reported and the package was put in
                place earlier this year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Frequently, there are complaints that some
                reviews take a considerable time to see the light of day and to
                be acted on. I am pleased to say that this review was undertaken
                in a short time frame, and action was taken within 12 months of
                its commencement.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.00 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Having met those in the initial cohort that
                have benefited from the new package, I take considerable
                satisfaction from having helped to put it in place. This is just
                a beginning; much more must be done, and much more could be done
                with resources that are not available at present.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The third issue relates to the wider
                provision of opportunities for lifelong learning. Many Members
                have been exercised by this. The individual learning accounts
                programme has been successful but, due to circumstances outside
                our control, it had to be suspended. The programme will be
                redeveloped in a more targeted way. However, notwithstanding
                suspension, almost 40,000 people have been able to draw down
                individual learning accounts and avail of additional or new
                forms of training and education which many of them would not
                previously have had access to.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members will have noted that learndirect
                centres are being opened in their constituencies — they are
                being opened across Northern Ireland. We have established nearly
                30 centres, and 32 will be open by March 2002. These will
                provide access to over 12,000 online courses.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members who are familiar with the provision
                of learndirect will know that the centres are located on high
                streets and have the appearance of shops. They are easily
                accessible and provide an innovative and imaginative approach to
                the provision of lifelong learning opportunities. When I visited
                the centres I was struck by the range of people from different
                backgrounds who use them. Young, middle-aged and older people
                are using the programme. I trust that Members are encouraging
                their constituents to avail of the opportunities that
                learndirect offers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We provide adequate lifelong learning
                opportunities. However, courses for those who need to improve
                their basic literacy, numeracy, and information technology
                skills must be provided in addition to this. Tribute has been
                paid to my Colleague, John Dallat, for frequently raising the
                problems associated with inadequate literacy and numeracy
                skills. I am aware of the needs that must be met. Many
                programmes are already in place, but from early next year, the
                new strategy for basic skills will be set up. Thereafter, we
                hope that provision will be made in a much more comprehensive
                and coherent way. This will involve the further education
                colleges working with community and voluntary organisations. We
                must reach out to all who, regrettably, have the types of
                numeracy and literacy difficulties that have been highlighted.
                It is important to note the tremendous contribution of many
                employers and the trade union movement in assisting us and in
                developing their own initiatives to tackle problems with their
                employees and members. I trust that, together with the various
                agencies, we will be able to make such progress that that
                problem will become one of the past, rather than one of the
                present.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The recent publication of the Burns Report
                has highlighted another important area for cross-departmental
                co-operation. I assure the House that my Department is in close
                consultation with my Colleague the Minister of Education’s
                Department, particularly in respect of those aspects of the
                Burns Report that touch on further education. Members will be
                familiar with the general proposals on co-operation between
                further education and second level education for pupils over the
                age of 16. However, I am aware that many Members have
                highlighted the need for a much more vocational dimension to the
                final years of compulsory schooling — in other words,
                schooling for 14- to 16-year-olds.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are addressing all of those curricular and
                structural issues in close consultation with the Department of
                Education. We want to ensure that, in future, all young people
                leaving school will meet the minimum standards they need to
                confidently enter training and further and higher education
                programmes, and thereby equip themselves for full and worthwhile
                participation in the labour market. That is the joint aim of
                both Departments’ work on the issues that have arisen from the
                Burns Report.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will briefly touch on several other
                specific issues that are in the Programme for Government and
                that must be highlighted. If we are to achieve the economic
                progress that is essential to our society and have a workforce
                that is adequately prepared, equipped, trained and qualified,
                then we must ensure that our training and further and higher
                education institutions are as up to date as possible with
                respect to information communication technology, both at
                infrastructural level and in the provision of courses to equip
                students with those skills and qualifications.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am pleased that, in line with the Programme
                for Government, considerable progress has been made on ensuring
                adequate provision for the further education and university
                sectors. Outside investors who come to Northern Ireland to
                assess the support that we have available never cease to be
                impressed by the provision that is there to produce trained
                technicians and graduates. As Members will be aware, there are
                not enough properly qualified people here, and we have worked
                hard recently with employers in several leading enterprises to
                establish fast-track training programmes to ensure that the
                people with the skills and the qualifications are available.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although there is still a long way to go, the
                infrastructure and courses are there. We may need a turnaround
                in curricular focus in our schools to ensure that interest is
                developed in careers other than those that have been pursued up
                to now through further and higher education. Again, that
                highlights the need for closer co- operation between my own
                Department and the Department of Education. More importantly, an
                adequate career guidance and counselling service is needed. In
                line with the contents of the Programme for Government, we hope
                to be able to put that in place early in the new year when the
                Fulton Report has been finalised and decisions taken on it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I argue to the House that, in attempting to
                meet my Department’s general targets, progress is being made.
                The progress that can be made, and, indeed, should be made will
                never end. Some issues on which progress might have been made
                more rapidly are tied to the availability of resources.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I accept Prof McWilliams’ point on Northern
                Ireland and conflict resolution. I have raised that issue
                frequently with our further and higher education colleges. More
                often than not our schools become the focal point for
                encouraging a greater sense of awareness of conflict resolution.
                The responsibilities fall to those who will be among the leaders
                in our social and economic sectors. We tend to say that only
                schools should address issues related to cross-community
                understanding, respect, democratic citizenship, and the
                responsibilities that are associated with those general
                concepts.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our further education colleges and
                universities have an even greater responsibility. Too often we
                focus on particular disciplines and look for excellence —
                rightly so — in those disciplines. However, there is also a
                wider responsibility to challenge our students’ understanding
                of democratic citizenship, and the rights and responsibilities
                that that concept implies. Issues that relate to conflict
                resolution, such as promoting respect and understanding of
                different traditions, can assist co-operation. Some of those
                challenges are not put to our students as directly as they
                should be. If they were, our young graduates and those who
                qualify from our further education colleges might develop a
                greater sense of responsibility. That point must be taken up by
                all in the Assembly and specifically by our institutions.</p>

                </i><b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ford:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issues that have been addressed fall into
                two broad areas. The first is the Health Service, which the
                Executive are supposed to have made a priority, and the second
                is the divisions in our society. Nobody who has spoken has been
                satisfied with the provisions for health services in the future.
                Most notably, the contributions from Mrs Iris Robinson and Ms
                Monica McWilliams, who backed Mr Kieran McCarthy’s concerns,
                made it clear that a great deal remains to be done. Almost all
                the additional money was redirected to acute services, even
                though the Hayes Report has not been implemented because no
                conclusion has been reached.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has been very little on community care
                and virtually nothing on psychiatric services and childcare.
                Even in community care, we have had sight of the promise of free
                nursing care for those who require residential nursing home
                places, but nothing on free personal care — a matter that is
                of considerably more consequence to more people. There is great
                concern that the people of Northern Ireland will be left behind
                — certainly behind Scotland and to some extent behind Wales
                — in that process as it goes on during this year. If the
                Executive were serious about tackling the real needs of the many
                elderly and disabled people in Northern Ireland, they would look
                at free personal care and not just at free nursing care.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In his opening remarks the Deputy First
                Minister said that the divisions in our society were dealt with
                in the section ‘Growing as a Community’, which, he said, was
                about tackling divisions in society. However, I can find only
                one sub-priority that deals with divisions in that section of
                the Programme for Government. If the Executive were so concerned
                about such divisions they should have devoted a chapter to them.
                Indeed, there are only three action points, and they are not
                terribly specific.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sub-priority 2 speaks of</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;the need to support the capacity of
                local communities to deal with matters of dispute and division
                including the proliferation of sectarian graffiti, unauthorised
                flag flying, the erection of memorials and other issues that can
                lead to community tensions&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, when my Colleagues and I write to
                Ministers about graffiti, kerbstone painting and the flying of
                illegal organisations’ flags, we are fobbed off with &quot;it
                cannot be done at this stage&quot; and &quot;community consensus
                is needed&quot;. Why is there no coherent action plan? We have
                instead</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;during 2002, following consultation,
                put in place a cross- departmental strategy&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This, I suspect, means that it will be 2004
                before anything is done. If the Programme for Government intends
                that something happen this year, I should like to hear from the
                Minister who will respond. I take it by his presence in the
                Chamber that Dermott Nesbitt will have that pleasure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is unfortunate that the First Minister was
                not present at any stage during the debate on the Programme for
                Government, and there was a relatively limited input from the
                Deputy First Minister. We should at least be grateful that Dr
                Farren has made a speech and remained in his place. He has shown
                some of his Colleagues what good manners are when dealing with
                the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In his opening speech the Deputy First
                Minister said that I had welcomed some of the Executive’s
                proposals. As usual when I find myself being quoted by
                Ministers, I checked Hansard, and it is only appropriate that I
                read for the record what I did say on 13 November. I talked
                about the concerns that Alliance Members had last year about
                tackling divisions:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The Executive took no notice of Members
                this time last year or during the debate in March 2001. I
                welcome the fact that, since then, they have addressed some of
                those concerns.&quot; — <i>[Official Report, Bound Volume 13,
                p 62].</p>
                </i></font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I may have welcomed their addressing some of
                the concerns, but we should remember that it took them over a
                year to recognise that our concerns were genuine. However, we
                should always be grateful for late converts to a necessary
                cause.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should not allow Mr Durkan to suggest that
                this is anything other than my recognition of those conversions,
                following the passage in the House of Mr Kieran McCarthy’s
                motion that more needed to be done to tackle issues such as
                flags and graffiti. At least they have responded to that.
                Therefore I claim a share of the credit, because that only
                appeared in the Programme for Government this year after an
                Alliance motion was accepted. If that offends the Deputy First
                Minister, I apologise, but it is factually accurate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Farren spoke as Minister for Employment
                and Learning. At the start of his speech, he clearly stated the
                concerns that he had for social justice in his Department. I
                welcome that statement. However, the issues that we are
                highlighting about divisions do not fall to his Department
                alone.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is nothing in this Programme for
                Government, as it currently stands, to suggest that there is
                serious cross-departmental action by the Department for Regional
                Development, the Department for Social Development, the
                Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, the
                Department of the Environment and his Department. If those signs
                were apparent — and perhaps Mr Nesbitt can respond to that
                effect — it might give us some reason for believing that the
                Programme for Government is meaningful on tackling divisions.
                Currently, it is not. The public service agreements do not tie
                through to show serious action at departmental level. However, I
                am always an optimist. I wait to be reassured that there will be
                something coming in the winding-up speech.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to deal with what two or three other
                Members said. I was particularly interested to hear the speech
                of Alex Maskey. He is the Chief Whip of one of the Executive
                parties, and therefore I presume that he speaks with a degree of
                authority for at least one of the Executive parties. In
                suggesting that the amendment should be rejected, he referred to
                the document as &quot;moderate&quot;. I can only presume that
                coming from a member of Sinn Féin that is not a compliment. He
                also said that it was vague and ill-defined, which would not be
                a compliment coming from anyone. Yet he said that it should be
                accepted because of the difficult background, and it should be
                endorsed as a work in progress. Let us hear from Mr Nesbitt that
                it is a work in progress. Let us hear a few more specifics. If
                that is the official view in an Executive party, I would love to
                hear a little more as to how it is work in progress, and a bit
                more about the details.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Kennedy:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will you vote for it then?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ford:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us hear what the Minister has to say. Let
                us hear the Minister’s assurances. I always have an open mind
                in this Chamber, unlike many Members who sit to my left.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Similarly Mr Cobain, when he spoke on behalf
                of the Committee for Social Development, made it clear that the
                Committee doubts the ability of the programme to deliver on many
                of the concerns that it has expressed. Mr Poots, as Chairperson
                of the Committee of the Centre, made clear his concerns from his
                Committee’s perspective. In particular, the community
                relations strategy and the victims strategy have badly slipped
                on their proposed timetables.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan asked me earlier about the
                practical steps that Alliance had suggested. I have outlined one
                or two of those. I find it a rather interesting concept that the
                Deputy First Minister, with the resources of Government, expects
                the opposition party to produce the practical steps. Those steps
                have so signally failed to come — unless Mr Nesbitt is going
                to pleasantly surprise us — in the course of the presentation
                of this report, the debate on the draft programme and debate
                today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As for practical steps, how about specific
                commitment to promote steps to make it easier for schools to
                transform to integrated status? It is clear that there is a
                demand for that. It is clear from what happened to Glengormley
                Primary School in my constituency last week that that demand can
                carry through, but it can create enormous difficulties under the
                current procedures with a group of parents who have divided
                loyalties on such an issue. If there is a commitment to
                promoting integrated education and to overcoming divisions, the
                transformation process must be made easier. That does not
                require legislation, but it does require Executive action. It is
                something that we should look to them for.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us see more specific proposals from this
                inter- departmental group. Let us see the Minister spell out, as
                he winds up this debate, the justification for the belief that
                his party and the other major party of Government appear to have
                that this amendment should not stand. Let us hear the specifics
                that will flesh out the paper as it currently stands to persuade
                us that we should be supporting their motion and not our
                amendment.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Junior Minister (Office of the First
                Minister and the Deputy First Minister) (Mr Nesbitt):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Mr Ford. He must have mentioned me at
                least six times, and I am not sure what I felt. It reminds me of
                something that he said some months ago. He requested that the
                proper Minister be in the Chamber to allay his fears. The then
                Deputy First Minister, Mr Mallon, was answering the question. Mr
                Mallon told him that he was sorry that neither Denis Haughey nor
                I were there, but that Mr Ford would have to deal with the mere
                Deputy First Minister. Today Mr Ford is looking for the Deputy
                First Minister and the First Minister, and I am sorry that he
                has to deal merely with me.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, that addresses a very important
                point. Mr Ford said that there were two matters that he wanted
                to be addressed and that the second was the divisions in our
                society. I speak not only on behalf of Mr Haughey, but also on
                behalf of Mr Trimble and Mr Durkan. I represent an
                Administration that is cross-community in composition and in its
                articulation of policies. That is important when trying to heal
                those divisions. The Programme for Government tries to ensure
                that areas of need are appropriately targeted, tries to create
                employment and tries to make sure that we rural-proof what we
                are trying to do in Northern Ireland. Through the vehicle of the
                Assembly, of which the Executive is a part, we are trying in our
                small way — and I accept that it is a small way — to heal
                the divisions in society. I am glad that Mr Ford made that
                point, and I do not wish to belittle it by pointing to specific
                sub-entities and sub-priorities. The Assembly is trying to heal
                those very divisions. It is what we are all about here.</p>

                tackle the deep divisions and inequalities in this society and
                therefore does not deliver the new beginning envisioned by the

                trying to achieve a cohesive, inclusive and just society than
                any other single document. The whole document plays a part. We
                have been debating the Programme for Government, and it contains
                a clear vision of:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;a peaceful, cohesive, inclusive,

                of reconciliation, tolerance, and mutual trust, and the
                protection and vindication of the human rights of all’.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is what the Programme is about. It is
                important that any Programme for Government be a visionary
                document. However, it must set out how that vision will be
                translated into reality. Our Programme for Government endeavours
                to do that. It includes priorities and sub-priorities, and it
                also includes specific actions that will be taken with public
                service agreements and new service delivery agreements. They are
                specific and measurable.</p>

                Every aspect of the Programme for Government is aimed at
                ensuring that there is equality of opportunity, in rural and
                urban areas, among males and females and in every section of
                Northern Ireland society. The divergence and diversity of
                Northern Ireland is the reason that we restate our commitment to
                targeting social need. That is part of our attempt to heal the
                divisions in Northern Ireland. I have latched on to the precise
                phrase that was used by Mr Ford: &quot;overcoming
                divisions&quot; in our society.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Programme has sub-priorities that cover
                the needs of victims of the troubles, committing us to improving
                community relations and tackling the divisions in our society.
                We are also committed to reviewing our current community
                relations policy, and putting in place in 2002 a
                cross-departmental strategy and framework for the promotion of
                community relations. We will also ensure that there is a
                co-ordinated and effective response to sectarian and racial
                intimidation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are problems in our society. We have
                recognised those problems, and I hope that together we will
                combat them, wherever they may be found. However, it is vital
                that we do not regard community relations as a simple,
                stand-alone issue. The priorities and actions throughout the
                programme are designed to tackle the deep and painful divisions
                that so clearly persist. I will refer later to our work to
                improve health. The implementation of every aspect of the
                programme that I mentioned in my introductory remarks — to
                help our children to do well in school, to help people to find
                work, to strengthen the economy — would help us to tackle the
                deep divisions and inequalities in our society.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am therefore disappointed that although the
                document was with the public in draft form for so long —
                between the end of September and the end of November — the
                Alliance Party did not present the Executive with detailed
                proposals that could be implemented. I recognise that that was
                part of your winding-up — in the sense of a speech.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ford:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the Member give way?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Nesbitt:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No. I thank you all the same.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I cannot, therefore, support the amendment,
                and I encourage all Members present to support the motion. In
                respect of the amendment, I re-emphasise the ambience of what we
                do here. Despite the different backgrounds and opinions of the
                parties who sit around these tables this afternoon — and we
                see who sits around these tables — we are here together to try
                to endorse a Programme for Government. That itself, I trust,
                will heal the divisions of our society.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Programme for Government contains special
                commitments, some of which I will examine in turn. Mrs Bell
                mentioned integrated education. The Programme for Government
                indicates our support for greater diversity in education. The
                Department of Education encourages and facilitates the
                development of integrated education, but it does not impose
                integration. Rather, it responds to parental demand for that
                form of schooling. The emphasis for future development of the
                integrated sector has increasingly been on transforming existing
                schools to integrated status. All schools will have received
                information on the requirements for the process of
                transformation to integrated status.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Kennedy raised the issue of targets for
                literacy and numeracy at Key Stage 3. The Executive remain fully
                committed to improving literacy and numeracy levels. The targets
                for English and mathematics at Key Stage 3 have been reduced;
                that was done in the light of new information on the progress
                being made below that level. We are all disappointed, but we
                must make a realistic and honest assessment of what the
                education service can be expected to deliver in the period until
                2004. That does not mean, however, that there has been any
                diminution of our efforts to improve standards of literacy and
                numeracy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Kennedy also referred to the Burns Report.
                I can confirm that the Programme for Government commits us to
                bringing forward proposals by September 2002 for the future
                structure of post-primary education. Mr Maskey also asked about
                that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Targets are important. They must be
                meaningful and challenging, but, above all, they must be
                deliverable. If there is slippage, we will report it and try to
                understand and explain it. We are trying to have achievable
                baselines and targets. That is progress on our position some
                years ago.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Byrne spoke about the infrastructure in
                the north-west region of Northern Ireland. I want to restate the
                Programme for Government’s commitment to making sure that the
                road infrastructure in Northern Ireland is maintained to a
                satisfactory standard. There has been other help for the
                north-west. The Toome bypass is one example of that, but there
                is also the recent announcement about the extension of the gas
                pipeline to the north-west.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Paisley spoke about rural proofing. I
                mentioned the importance of rural proofing in my response to Mr
                Ford. I understand that the Minister of Agriculture and Rural
                Development intends to discuss her proposals for the
                implementation of rural proofing shortly and that the first
                meeting of the interdepartmental steering group under her
                chairmanship will soon take place. Dr Paisley also raised the
                issue of funding for the work flowing from the vision exercise.
                At this stage the Budget does not include any additional
                resources. However, the need for resources for the exercise will
                be considered following the current consultation and the
                preparation of the draft action plan in spring 2002.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Paisley referred to fishing and to the
                important meetings that will take place next week. I can
                empathise with those concerned about the fishing fleets, and I
                am mindful of the constituencies in which they are harboured; I
                shall say no more than that, Madam Deputy Speaker.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Gallagher asked about proposals for the
                future of our acute hospitals, and I understand that the
                Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety has
                undertaken consultation. I hope that that will help the Minister
                to reach decisions on the best way forward with the Executive.
                She also proposes to issue a consultation paper following
                discussion with her Executive Colleagues and believes that there
                is a need for a further consultation paper because of the
                importance of the issue. Since Mr Fee mentioned the word
                &quot;consultation&quot; three times — and I will check that
                Mr Fee is in his place; he is — I am conscious that he made
                reference to &quot;consultation fatigue&quot;, and in his
                concluding remarks he made a plea for some implementation after
                four and a half years of consultation. I share his concern, not
                about the specifics in relation to the Health Service, but about
                an over- abundance of consultation that can lead to a delay in
                the delivery of services.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr William McCrea raised some points
                about sustainability in the Programme for Government, which
                makes clear our commitment to promoting sustainable living and
                achieving effective protection of the environment. Our desire to
                secure a competitive economy is not inconsistent with that
                commitment, and the programme recognises the need for our region
                to develop sustainability.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member also raised the issue of water
                quality and questioned why we do not have a more ambitious
                target for river water quality. We are doing much on that. The
                Assembly needs to bear in mind that action is being taken where
                river quality is below the standard required to enable us to
                meet our commitments. The Environment and Heritage Service, an
                agency of the Department of the Environment, has identified a
                number of targets on which specific action is being taken to
                address water quality problems.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will comment now on targets, actions,
                public service and service delivery agreements. The service
                delivery agreements should now be with Committees for
                consultation and discussion. I ask Members to look at them
                carefully and to contribute to their improvement — they are
                more detailed than the public service agreements and are in
                their formative stage. The Office of the First Minister and the
                Deputy First Minister looked at the service delivery agreements
                as part of a developmental process, and the Committees’
                contributions will play a very important part in formulating
                them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Cobain spoke about housing and fuel
                poverty. The Programme for Government commits us to ensure that
                everyone can get access to decent, affordable housing. In the
                Executive’s first Programme for Government — and I hope that
                the second one will be endorsed today — the Assembly committed
                itself to undertake a range of actions. Those commitments in
                last year’s programme included the building of new dwellings
                every year in the social housing sector, and arranging for the
                adaptation of properties to ensure that house design meets the
                needs of older people and those with disabilities. We aimed to
                raise the standard of the Housing Executive’s stock by making
                improvements to dwellings. We also had a commitment to carry out
                heating conversions to gas or oil each year to ensure more
                economic and efficient heating. These actions from last year’s
                Programme for Government remain valid and are supported in the
                Department for Social Development’s public service agreement,
                which forms parts of the Programme for Government document,
                which has comprehensive targets for reducing fuel poverty in
                2002-03. One example is the Department for Social Development’s
                objective 2.1:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;By December 2004, reduce by 20,000 the
                numbers of fuel poor households in the private sector by
                providing energy efficient low cost heating/insulation
                systems.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Action will be taken in support of that
                target — we will support heating and insulation work to
                vulnerable households under the warm homes scheme. By carrying
                that targeted action through, work will be completed on 6,250
                homes in the year 2002-03. There are clear, identifiable targets
                and actions to deliver that aspect of housing and address the
                poverty of the housing sector. It is to be hoped that those
                clear aims will be sustained.</p>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr ONeill also dealt with homelessness. The
                new housing Bill will impact on that issue by refining the
                definitions of homelessness and intentional homelessness. The
                Housing Executive launched a review of its homelessness strategy
                and services on 24 September 2001. Statutory and voluntary
                agencies that work in the area of housing, as well as probation,
                health and social services and community groups have been
                consulted. With apologies to Mr Fee, consultation will finish on
                31 December 2001. The review will be finalised by March 2002,
                and an implementation plan will be produced to progress work on
                the various recommendations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Housing Executive has identified
                additional need — totalling £300,000 — in relation to
                voluntary agencies in the community which assist the Housing
                Executive in delivering its obligations to the homeless. A bid
                for that funding will be made in the December monitoring round,
                and it will be aimed at the most vulnerable people in the
                community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Poots made some points about the review of
                public administration. This is an important issue. One Member
                described it as, perhaps, the single most important element. The
                Executive are committed to ensuring that there is greater
                accountability for all services in Northern Ireland through a
                more efficient and effective structure of administration at
                local and regional levels. We are committed to undertaking a
                comprehensive strategic review of public administration. We
                realise that there have been difficulties in advancing that, but
                it is a difficult matter, and it will take time. A range of
                complex issues must be resolved before we can embark on such an
                ambitious project. All aspects must be taken into account, such
                as health provision or the Burns Report on education. A complex
                project is being considered, but I remain committed to it, and I
                am confident that it will commence early in the new year, with
                clear terms of reference to be seen. The Assembly and its
                Committees will have a full opportunity to give their views on
                the review.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Poots also raised the issue of the
                commissioner for children. As Members know, the consultation
                period closed on 8 November. We are in the process of analysing
                the responses and making decisions on the way forward. The
                Executive remain committed to having a commissioner in place by
                June 2002. We have invested considerable effort in ensuring that
                the consultation was as comprehensive as possible. We tried to
                find out not merely what adults think children wish, but what
                children wish for themselves. That was not easy; it was
                difficult and sensitive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Over 11,000 copies of the consultation
                document and 260,000 information leaflets were distributed. In
                answer to the specific question, the commissioner will be
                appointed in line with public appointment procedures.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Poots also asked about the equality impact
                assessment. The Equality Commission issued practical guidance on
                how equality impact assessment should be carried out. The
                guidelines relate to individual policies. It is not practicable
                to apply them directly to the Programme for Government, which
                covers a wide range of policies, programmes and actions. The
                problem of how best to link them together has been, and will
                continue to be, discussed with the Equality Commission. As
                Departments develop proposals for inclusion in the Programme for
                Government, the commission will consider whether those policies,
                programmes, actions and matters, which are included in the
                sub-priorities, will promote equality of opportunity and/or
                address inequalities for any of the categories under section 75
                of the Northern Ireland Act 1998.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Individual policies mentioned in the
                Programme for Government will be subject to full equality impact
                assessment by Departments, in accordance with their equality
                schemes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with Mr Dallat on the issue of proper
                and effective management of public resources and the review of
                public administration. Our services should give value for money.
                Whether we are in a Committee, in the Chamber or in consultation
                with those in the community, we must at all times try to secure
                the best output for the given input of resources.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that new initiatives such as public
                service agreements and service delivery agreements will have an
                impact. Committees must make their contribution to the
                improvement of service delivery agreements so that our services
                are managed properly and effectively. Six needs and
                effectiveness evaluations are being conducted throughout the
                sector, and they will make a contribution. All those measures
                should give better value for money.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issue of cancer services was raised by
                Iris Robinson. Since September we have been examining how we can
                improve the Health Service, including services for those
                suffering from cancer, heart disease and renal failure.
                Paragraph 3.6 of the Programme for Government commits us to
                improving access to cardiac surgery, strengthening treatment
                processes for cancer suffers at local units and at the cancer
                centre in Belfast, and increasing the number of renal dialysis
                sessions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When I last spoke on the Programme for
                Government, I mentioned the money that is being spent on health,
                and the feeling in the 1940s, when the Health Service was set
                up, that the service would become less costly. However, it has
                become more costly simply to stand still. An additional £41
                million has been allocated to health and social services. To put
                that in context, that is an additional £224 million, or a rise
                of 9·7%. That includes a transfer of £19 million from the
                social security budget, so that the actual cash increase is
                £205 million, or a rise of 8·9%, which does not allow for
                inflation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The bulk of that extra money is required to
                meet the rising cost of providing essential services. The £41
                million will go some way to improving healthcare. However, I
                have a caveat: it is not enough simply to provide money. It is
                the management of services that will make the difference. There
                will be value for money if the output is maximised for the given
                level of input. Therefore, the needs and effectiveness
                evaluations are important.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCarthy raised the issue of free personal
                care. Earlier this year the Assembly resolved that the Executive
                should implement in full the recommendations of the Royal
                Commission on Long Term Care for the Elderly. We put particular
                emphasis on that provision.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An interdepartmental group has been
                established to consider the scope for moving to the provision of
                free care, resources permitting. That group will advise if or
                when — I hope that it is when, not if — free personal care
                for the elderly might be introduced. The costs have been
                estimated to be at least £25 million per annum. The
                interdepartmental group will take account of the findings of the
                Scottish Executive’s care development group’s recent report,
                ‘Fair Care for Older People’.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms McWilliams referred to public-private
                partnerships (PPPs). The Committee for Finance and Personnel’s
                report and recommendations are being fully considered by the PPP
                working group, which was established by the Executive in
                accordance with the commitment in the Programme for Government.
                The group will review the use of PPPs to achieve value for money
                and to address the infrastructural deficit in Northern Ireland.
                The working group is also considering alternative sources of
                funding for improvements to public services. The group will
                provide useful information. A report is expected by March 2002,
                and it will be the subject of public consultation prior to any
                final decisions. I hope that those decisions will have been
                taken by September 2002.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Programme for Government is a
                comprehensive document. Many parts of the programme try to heal
                the divisions in our society, which was the central concern of
                those who tabled the amendment. I commend the programme to the
                Assembly.</p>
