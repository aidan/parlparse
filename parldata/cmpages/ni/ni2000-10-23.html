                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That the Second Stage of the Health and
                Personal Social Services Bill (NIA 3/00) be agreed.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill we are to consider today deals with
                a wide range of very important issues in health and personal
                social services. It is in four parts, the first of which
                introduces the Social Care Council. Part II makes further
                provision for the recovery from insurance companies of the cost
                of Health Service treatment of road accident casualties. Part
                III introduces miscellaneous amendments, including the repeal of
                legislation relating to GP fundholding and measures to reduce
                the evasion of Health Service charges. Part IV provides for the
                regulation of the pharmacy profession and a number of general
                matters.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall set out the detail of each of these
                in turn. I am sure Members will have questions on the Bill’s
                various parts, and I propose to deal with these in my closing
                remarks.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Madam Deputy Speaker [Ms Morrice] in the
                Chair)</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Part I deals with the very important issue of
                training and the standards of conduct and practice expected of
                all social care workers. At present, there is no professional
                regulatory body dedicated to overseeing standards in the social
                care field. The Central Council for Education and Training in
                Social Work (CCETSW) regulates social work training by setting
                requirements, approving and monitoring courses and making
                awards. However, there is no such organisation in other fields
                to take a lead in driving up both standards of training and
                quality of care throughout the workforce.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I propose therefore to remedy that gap and
                set up a Social Care Council which will carry out those duties.
                It will promote high standards, both in the conduct and practice
                of social care workers and in their training. Strong support for
                such a council was expressed by an overwhelming number of
                respondents to the extensive consultation my Department carried
                out in the autumn of 1998.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some 150,000 people receive social services
                of one form or another. These services are delivered by more
                than 30,000 social care workers, ranging from professional
                social workers to care assistants and home helps, and in a
                variety of settings, from nursing homes to clients’ own homes.
                Around 80% of the workforce have no qualifications relevant to
                their jobs. If we are to provide the highest possible standards
                of care, this is simply not good enough. Social care workers
                deal with many difficult and distressing human problems. I know
                that the vast majority carry out their duties diligently and
                conscientiously, but unfortunately that is not always the case.
                There have been instances in every part of these islands of
                unacceptable standards of conduct and of vulnerable people,
                including children in care, suffering harm and abuse.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The council will therefore have two key
                responsibilities: to register and regulate the workforce and
                draw up codes of practice for both social care workers and their
                employers; and to ensure that staff are properly trained and
                qualified to do their jobs. The functions of the CCETSW will be
                transferred to the new council, as will the functions of the
                training organisation for personal social services in Northern
                Ireland. This should ensure that education, training and
                qualifications are to a high standard, fit for their purpose and
                meet the needs of the social care workforce. The ultimate aim is
                to raise the quality of the services provided and put in place
                better safeguards for the protection of people being cared for.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The council will register the social care
                workforce, starting with qualified social workers. Other high
                priority groups will be registered from the start, including
                team leaders, all staff in residential childcare and the heads
                of residential homes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Separate transitional parts of the register
                will be opened for other groups of social care workers within a
                timescale set by my Department, initially on the basis of having
                signed up to codes of conduct and practice. Time limits will be
                set both for achieving appropriate qualifications, such as NVQs,
                for each particular job and for subsequent transfer to the main
                register. The definition of &quot;social care worker&quot; will
                be very wide. It will include not only people working in
                residential homes, but also those involved in the provision of
                personal care in other settings, including day centres or a
                service user’s own home.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Registration will depend on an applicant’s
                being of good character, being physically and mentally fit for
                the particular job, and satisfying the training or educational
                requirements laid down by the Social Care Council for that part,
                or parts, of the register for which the applicant seeks
                registration. The council will have power to suspend, vary, or
                cancel registration if individuals are unfit to practise on the
                grounds of misconduct, bad practice, negligence, abuse or ill
                health. There will, of course, be an appeals procedure when
                registration is refused or cancelled in this way. Registration
                will make it possible for employers to check the suitability of
                potential employees and to keep unsuitable or undesirable people
                out of the social care workforce. Similar councils in Great
                Britain will also maintain registers, and there will be
                co-operation between all four councils.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The council will be an independent body but
                will carry out its functions in accordance with directions given
                to it by my Department, and it will be under the Department’s
                general guidance. It is not intended that the council should be
                a self-regulating body for the social care workforce, and it
                will therefore have a significant lay membership. Though not
                specified in the Bill itself, I plan to introduce regulations to
                allow for a total membership of 21 to 25, which will include the
                chairperson. The membership will be split into approximately one
                third laypersons, users and carers, one third registrants and
                one third other stakeholders such as employers, unions and
                professional associations. This will create a balanced
                membership so that the interests of one group do not
                predominate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill will also make it an offence for
                anyone to register as a social worker with intent to deceive.
                Further, it will allow the Department to make regulations to
                prohibit people from working in certain jobs unless they are
                listed in the appropriate part of the register.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Department provides funding of almost
                £500,000 annually to the CCETSW, and this will be transferred
                to the new council. I intend that the maintenance of the
                register will be paid for by setting an appropriate registration
                fee, which should eventually raise at least £300,000. The
                council will also be able to charge for other services and
                publications. It must be recognised that the council’s role
                will be much wider than that of CCETSW, and some additional
                funding will be needed from within the existing budget of my
                Department.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Part II deals with the recovery of costs for
                hospital treatment for road accident casualties. It provides for
                the introduction of a new simplified procedure for the recovery
                from insurance companies of the costs of treatment, and it
                increases the maximum amount recoverable. While the Bill does
                not introduce any new charges, it does extend the current charge
                to include outpatient treatment. The provisions will not affect
                the amount of compensation paid to casualties.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Under the present law the charge for
                inpatient treatment, up to a maximum of £2,949 per case, is
                levied on insurance by a hospital when a road accident casualty
                makes a successful claim for compensation. The present system
                for collecting the charges is not efficient or effective. The
                proposed new provisions will help hospitals by easing the
                administrative burden on them, will simplify the system, which
                will help insurers, and will bring charges more into line with
                actual costs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The provisions in part II will centralise
                recovery arrangements for the cost of hospital treatment by
                placing the responsibility for this on the Department for Social
                Development instead of on the hospitals. In practice the Social
                Security Agency’s Compensation Recovery Unit (CRU) will
                recover the charges.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">10.45 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The decision to use the CRU, which was taken
                following an option appraisal, makes good sense, because the new
                scheme will be similar to the benefit recovery scheme that the
                CRU has operated for 10 years. In line with the benefit recovery
                scheme, compensators, who are almost exclusively insurance
                companies, will be required to apply to the CRU for a
                certificate of Health Service charges for any case in which a
                road accident casualty claiming compensation has received
                hospital treatment. To help simplify the system and to stop
                hospitals from having to calculate charges in every case, a
                tariff of charges will be introduced. This means that the
                hospital, the insurer and the CRU, which will make the final
                calculation, will know from a few simple facts how much the
                charge will be. For the first time, the Health Service will be
                able to recover charges in cases where a driver who caused an
                accident is uninsured or untraceable and the casualty receives
                compensation from the Motor Insurers’ Bureau. The Bill brings
                the bureau into the scheme.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, although difficult to predict, it is
                estimated that the scheme could bring in an extra £2·5 million
                per annum. Recovered moneys will be paid directly to trusts, so
                that hospitals that provide the care will benefit from the
                income. The CRU’s administration costs are estimated at about
                £150,000 per year, and those will be met by my Department. The
                effect on motor insurance premiums is not expected to be
                significant.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I now turn to part three of the Bill, which
                sets out a number of miscellaneous amendments. I am presently
                considering measures to replace GP fundholding. Pending
                decisions on those measures, as a first step, it is necessary to
                take powers to repeal the fundholding legislation, which can be
                given effect when I take the final decisions on the way forward
                for primary care.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill introduces three new administrative
                measures concerning family health practitioners. First,
                technical changes will be made to the machinery for the
                remuneration of practitioners to clarify the statutory
                requirements for such remuneration.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, family health practitioners will be
                required to take out professional indemnity insurance. Most
                practitioners already hold such insurance, often through
                professional defence organisations, but this will be compulsory
                in future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thirdly, the Health and Personal Social
                Services (Northern Ireland) Order 1972 provides for the
                representation of family health services practitioners on local
                committees, which represent their interests in discussions with
                health and social services boards. The Bill aims to ensure that
                the practitioners themselves continue to be eligible to sit on
                local representative committees, but that, in addition,
                assistants or deputies will be allowed to represent them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill also contains measures aimed at
                reducing the evasion of Health Service charges by patients and
                fraud by family health practitioners. Health Service charges
                include prescription, dental and optical charges. Exemption from
                these charges is granted for a number of reasons, such as age,
                certain medical conditions, being in receipt of social security
                benefits or on a low income. There is evidence of considerable
                evasion of charges. It is estimated that during the last
                financial year, some £14 million was lost due to fraudulent
                exemption claims. The Bill introduces two deterrent measures. It
                creates a civil penalty for wrongful exemption from, or refund
                of, a Health Service charge, and it introduces a specific
                criminal offence for knowingly evading or fraudulently gaining a
                reduction in Health Service charges.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I mentioned, the Bill also contains
                measures to deter fraud by family health practitioners. At
                present, a practitioner’s name may be removed from a board’s
                list if a tribunal, constituted under the Health and Personal
                Social Services (Northern Ireland) Order 1972, acting on
                representations, finds that the continued inclusion of that
                person’s name in a list is prejudicial to the efficiency of
                the service. These are normally referred to as efficiency cases.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill expands the tribunal’s remit to
                hear representations that a practitioner’s name should be
                removed from a list on the grounds that he has caused detriment
                to any health scheme by securing — or trying to secure — for
                himself or another financial or other benefit to which he is not
                entitled.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Reciprocal arrangements with England,
                Scotland and Wales provide that the removal of a name from a
                list in any one of those jurisdictions would mean removal from,
                or non-inclusion in, a list in any of the others. The new
                provisions, therefore, include provision for any person
                aggrieved by a tribunal’s decision to appeal to the Court of
                Appeal, or — for example, where there is new evidence — to
                apply to the tribunal for a review of its decision.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill will further provide for the
                disclosure of information obtained by the Commissioner of
                Complaints. During the course of investigating a complaint, the
                Commissioner may come across information suggesting that a
                person represents a danger to the health or safety of service
                users. The Bill clarifies the circumstances in which such
                information can be disclosed to, for instance, an employer. Such
                information must only be given to persons whom the Commissioner
                considers need to know in order to prevent a danger to service
                users. He must also inform the person involved that the
                information has been disclosed and to whom it has been
                disclosed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill also makes a number of provisions
                concerned with the Department’s power to direct trusts and
                with administrative changes in relation to their establishment
                and finances. For example, the Bill will enable the Department
                to set quality targets for treating service users and to
                determine the pay of trust chief executives and their senior
                staff.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, part III makes provision for a
                number of miscellaneous matters. These include clarifying the
                legal basis for the exchange of information between the
                Registrar General’s Office and the Department; limiting the
                liability of officers of health and social services councils
                acting in the course of their duties; permitting
                pre-registration house officers to undertake training in general
                medical practice; requiring health and social services bodies to
                open their meetings to the public; and clarifying the existing
                law that the sale of the goodwill of medical practices is
                illegal.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I come now to part IV of the Bill. An
                important provision here will enable the Department by order to
                amend legislation regulating the profession of pharmaceutical
                chemist. The Bill contains provision for the Department, by
                order subject to affirmative resolution of the Assembly, to
                amend the Pharmacy (Northern Ireland) Order 1976. This would
                facilitate flexibility in the arrangements governing the
                profession here similar to the regime introduced by the Health
                Act 1999 in relation to the pharmacy and other professions in
                Britain.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Madam Deputy Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given the number of Members who have put
                their names down to contribute, I ask that each Member limit his
                or her contribution to five minutes.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Health, Social
                Services and Public Safety Committee (Dr&nbsp;Hendron):</b> As
                Chairperson of the Health, Social Services and Public Safety
                Committee, I welcome the Bill. I know that Committee members are
                looking forward to considering it at Committee Stage. I will
                keep my comments brief because it is important that the
                Committee is given the opportunity to consider the Bill in
                detail.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the Minister said, the Bill covers four
                broad areas. Part I provides for a body to regulate the social
                work profession and other social care workers. That will be
                welcomed by social workers as they have long recognised the need
                to regulate the social care workforce to protect patients,
                carers and the workforce itself. However, I suspect there may be
                a debate about the appointments procedure contained in schedule
                1.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I understand that the aim of part II of the
                Bill is to simplify the system used to recover much needed cash
                for health and personal services from the compensation paid to
                the casualties of road traffic accidents.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Part III of the Bill covers a wide range of
                amendments to the law covering health and personal social
                services in Northern Ireland, including the repeal of the law
                which established GP fundholding. The Health, Social Services
                and Public Safety Committee is concerned that the lessons
                learned during GP fundholding are not forgotten, and it is
                looking forward to discussing with the Minister her proposals
                for a new primary care service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee has concerns, however, about
                the timing of the introduction of the changes. It is important
                that there is not a vacuum. Measures to introduce penalties for
                fraudulently evading prescription charges and changes to tighten
                the control exercised by the Department on the administrative
                and financial arrangements of trusts are also included. These
                are positive steps. Powers to regulate pharmaceutical chemists
                in Northern Ireland by subordinate legislation are covered in
                part IV. These will bring pharmacists into line with other
                health professionals, and that is welcomed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Committee members will be looking in great
                detail at all the issues covered in the Bill, and we will return
                with amendments at Consideration Stage should they be considered
                necessary.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Robert Coulter:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also welcome the introduction of the Bill.
                It is not before time that it is being brought before the House.
                The Bill is to be commended as it is providing for a
                professional body for social workers. The time has come for
                social workers to be given the respect and recognition they
                deserve. I am glad that the council will be independent and not
                be self-regulating and that the training schemes envisaged will
                bring greatly needed equality to the workforce in the social
                care area.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the Chairperson has already mentioned,
                there are some concerns about the appointments procedure, and
                that is an issue that the Committee will be looking at in depth.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the problems in Northern Ireland is
                what happens to patients after they leave hospital, and it is
                welcomed that this area of care is being looked at. I also
                welcome part II of the Bill, which deals with the recovery of
                costs after accidents; this measure should have been introduced
                long ago, and I support it fully.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am glad that, under this Bill, the
                Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety will
                have the power to direct trusts. Trusts will no longer be
                autonomous — they will be accountable to another body.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the regulations concerning
                pharmaceutical chemists. However, it is hoped that the Minister
                and the Department will ensure that the new council will not be
                just another centre for administration soaking up much of the
                badly needed funds for patient care. It is hoped that the
                council will be a well working, slim and efficient body. I
                welcome the Bill.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Berry:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the
                Bill, although it is no thanks to the Minister for Sinn Féin/IRA
                who arrived with it a week late and with very little apology. I
                listened very closely to what the Minister said and all that I
                heard in her apology was the word &quot;misunderstanding&quot;
                — it was her duty to be in the House at the proper time on
                that day.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, from the outset it seems that the
                only the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety
                will gain anything from the Bill. Any reading of it confirms the
                view that if anything should be reviewed at present it is the
                Department itself.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a range of matters in the Bill that
                I still seek clarification on. Members have listened closely to
                what has been said about social workers, and it is to be
                welcomed that they are going to be properly registered. However,
                there are still major concerns and a great need for
                clarification on the registers.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clause 3 (2) of the Bill says</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;There shall be a separate part of the
                register for social workers and for each description of social
                care workers so specified.&quot;</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The Department may by order provide for
                a specified part of the register to be closed, as from a date
                specified by the order, so that on or after that date no further
                persons can become registered in that part.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clarification is needed on where social
                workers stand if they are not able to be properly registered.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clause 9 should include the word
                &quot;must&quot;. Clarification is also needed on the rules
                which will determine that, unless it is spelt out from the
                beginning, these bodies will conveniently dismiss those who
                ought to be consulted. The codes of practice need to be
                tightened up. The Bill states that the council shall do this and
                the council shall do that — the council should be held more
                responsible.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clause 11 deals with qualifications gained
                outside Northern&nbsp;Ireland. There are currently many
                qualifications which ought to have equivalence but which the
                state does not recognise for fear that they will downgrade its
                imposed qualifications. I think of the anomaly with NVQs which
                are counted while other qualifications with historic standing in
                the world of business are dismissed, simply because they would
                downgrade NVQs. This equivalence should be spelt out in greater
                detail.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One very important matter is the status of
                this council as set out on page&nbsp;39. The Bill proposes to
                replace the existing Central Council for Education and Training
                in Social Work (CCETSW). That is all right, but the status that
                will be given to the new council needs greater clarification.
                What was the reasoning behind this? It reads</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The Council shall not be regarded as
                the servant or agent of the Crown or as enjoying any status,
                immunity or privilege of the Crown; and the Council’s property
                shall not be regarded as property of, or property held on behalf
                of, the Crown.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want a list of all other bodies, especially
                state bodies, that have the same status, and I want to see book,
                chapter and verse of such status elsewhere. Once again, the
                Department intends to be good to itself financially. The
                estimated cost of this council is £1·4&nbsp;million. I trust
                that this will not just be more bureaucracy in Northern Ireland.
                The Assembly needs to think very carefully before going to the
                taxpayers and telling them that they will have something else to
                pay for.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Part II deals with the payment for hospital
                treatment of traffic casualties, and I broadly welcome the
                principle of recovery. But what concerns me is that the only
                people who will do the paying are the companies of those who
                have insurance.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are two glaring weaknesses. First,
                those who drive without insurance and cause death and injury
                make no reparation to the hospital, but they still get
                treatment. That ought to have been dealt with in the Bill. As it
                stands, you are worse off if you have insurance. Secondly, there
                is the matter of those who are charged with careless or
                dangerous driving and who have injured themselves. There is no
                mention of their making reparations to the hospital for
                treatment. That is a major problem at present.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clause&nbsp;39 deals with the repeal of the
                law about fundholding practices. I welcome the initiative to end
                fundholding, but it is quite pathetic that we have no template
                or vision for its replacement. However, the fact that the
                Minister herself has no vision or strategy — she thinks only
                of reviews — explains why this is so.</p>

                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Berry:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There should have been three separate Bills
                for this major discussion today.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Ramsey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat. I too welcome this Bill,
                one of the first Bills published by a local Minister who is
                accountable to the Assembly and, what is more important than
                that, is accountable to local people. This is a positive
                development as we can now scrutinise the Health Service. It is
                also positive as this is the first time in some years that we
                will have a structured say in shaping that Health Service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On welcoming the proposed establishment of
                the Social Care Council I support the need to regulate the
                working practices and training of the people involved in this
                scheme. The Department and the Assembly need to recognise the
                hard work and commitment of social workers in delivering a
                quality service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proposed council will enhance and
                maintain the work of social workers, and I support that.
                However, some aspects of the council concern me. While I welcome
                the Department’s ensuring that its service users and
                lay-people are in the majority on the council, I have a problem
                with the Department’s appointing it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister’s statement that one
                third of the council will be made up of trade union
                representatives. However, a disciplinary procedure needs to be
                developed, not only with the delivery of a quality service in
                mind but with the inclusion of input from the unions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The training remit needs to be strengthened
                and, more importantly, resourced. We are all aware of good
                legislation being put through here but with no resources or
                money following for it to be implemented. This cannot happen
                again. We need to take account of new pieces of legislation and
                the equality agenda.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Like my colleague on the Health Committee,
                Paul Berry, I welcome clause 11, enabling the council to
                recognise qualifications gained in European Economic Area (EEA)
                states as being equivalent to those gained in the North. There
                is a need for work practices to be developed in conjunction with
                bodies in the 26 counties to ensure quality of service and
                exchange of staff on an all-Ireland basis.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sinn Féin is for free health care at the
                point of delivery. While, again, I understand the reasoning
                behind this part of the Bill, I remain to be convinced that this
                is the best way forward. The arguments put forward for
                supporting it are that this legislation will bring us into line
                with England, Scotland and Wales. We are a legislative body.
                This Assembly should decide its own way forward. Just because
                something happens elsewhere, does not necessarily mean that it
                is right.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sinn Féin’s position on GP fundholding has
                been on the record many times. We have been against fundholding
                from its inception as we believe it created a two-tier system.
                It also promoted inequality in the Health Service. I welcome the
                closing of this chapter, but we need to learn lessons from
                fundholding in order to make the Health Service more accessible
                to all.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have also been opposed to the setting up
                of unaccountable trusts. These facilitate the establishment of
                an internal market. I do not believe that trusts can plan and
                deliver services at the same time, and we are all aware of the
                recent report by the Audit Office on the amount of money paid
                out to chief executives. That report shows, and also makes me
                believe, that once again these are unaccountable quangos.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While we have been against the trusts, I
                welcome the provisions in this Bill that will give the
                Department power to direct trusts to provide services they
                should be providing at ground level and to set pay scales as
                advised by the Audit Office.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the new arrangements that will make
                trusts more open and accountable. On the issue of prescription
                charges, I agree that prescription fraud is high. However, we
                need to tackle institutional fraud in nursing homes and among
                GPs, chemists and dentists. Again, I welcome the provisions in
                the Bill.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also welcome clause 51, which deals with
                the provision of information on births and deaths. We welcome
                this as a vital part of targeting resources and redressing
                inequalities in the Health Service. When the Bill goes to
                Committee Stage I would like more details on that provision.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clause 54 provides for public access to
                meetings of health and social services bodies. At the moment,
                there is no statutory obligation for bodies to open their
                meetings to the public although I am aware that some do.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCarthy:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Alliance Party welcomes many of the
                measures in this Bill. For too long we have left many aspects of
                our health care unregulated. The vulnerable and needy have been
                harmed by this dereliction of duty. We can only welcome the
                setting up of a register for social workers. These workers
                perform an important function, and we recognise that the vast
                majority approach their jobs with a professionalism and
                dedication that can only be admired.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Having a register that would reassure
                employing agencies about the qualifications of social workers
                will go far to maintain the high levels of service that we have
                come to expect from our social care staff. We are also pleased
                to see that the Government have finally recognised that GP
                fundholding has had its day. Since its inception, the Alliance
                Party has been greatly concerned about it — anything that
                complicates matters for our already overstressed and
                overstretched doctors and is of doubtful benefit to the patients
                ought to be abandoned.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is laudable that we are setting out to
                recuperate more funds for our Health Service through a more
                comprehensive recovery of the cost of treating road accidents
                and by trying to cut down on fraud in the NHS, particularly in
                relation to prescription charges. I urge caution with the
                estimate of the moneys that will be regained. I hope that we can
                increase the amount recovered from road accidents — currently
                £0·5 million per annum — but I fear that insurance companies
                and individuals will not always want to co-operate. The
                collection of a few million pounds through that method will not
                ease the crises that our Health Service faces — the closing of
                wards, the cancellation of operations and the growth of waiting
                lists. We may want those who are responsible for road accidents
                to pay for the damage that they cause, but that would have, at
                most, only a symbolic effect and will do little to ease the
                financial strain faced by so many of our acute care providers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Moves to tackle fraud are equally laudable,
                but I urge Members to think longer and more deeply about the
                problem. Perhaps one way to ease the cost of fraud would be to
                lower prescription charges; for some, they are too high already.
                People are hit with charges for a range of drugs. Faced with the
                costs, many are tempted to act fraudulently and fill out the
                back of the prescription form, thus claiming exemption. Perhaps
                lowering the costs would encourage more honesty. I am, however,
                convinced that people in the marginal sections of our society
                are confused by the many forms that they are required to fill in
                to receive benefits, including free prescriptions. We should be
                looking for ways to ease the cost of prescriptions, to ensure
                that those entitled to free prescriptions receive them and,
                finally, to tackle the fraud issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Government have committed themselves to
                increasing the use of electronic forms and the use of IT
                generally in the administration of our health and other
                services. We should design software and hardware to aid the
                transfer of the necessary details onto the forms and ensure that
                people receive all their entitlements, and we should use the
                information to cut down fraud. We should not stop at the narrow
                provisions of the Bill but think about innovative ways to meet
                the needs of the population.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We support the Bill, which contains many
                worthwhile measures. However, it is just a first step towards
                creating the kind of health and social services that the people
                of Northern Ireland want, need and deserve.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms McWilliams:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will not reiterate the questions that were
                raised at meetings of the Health, Social Services and Public
                Safety Committee. There were many, and the five-minute time
                limit does not allow me to go into detail. I will simply take up
                some of the points that the Minister raised in her speech, some
                of which we may not have been au fait with until now.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, I would like to raise concern about
                the proposal that the old Central Council for Education and
                Training in Social Work (CCETSW) is to be stood down, as
                provided for in the Bill. If the Bill does not go through in the
                expected time, will there be a delay in the establishment of the
                Northern Ireland Social Care Council? If so, what will happen in
                the interim? Will there be transitional arrangements?</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.15 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, this is the first time I have heard
                about the make-up of the council. Although I am pleased with the
                nature of the appointments, I share the concerns of Ms Ramsey.
                It is important that we have detail on that. All we knew was
                that there was to be a majority of users and lay people. It now
                seems that a third of the council is to be made up of lay people
                and users and another third made up of those registered, which
                is something I would like more detail on. How can this be the
                case if we are attempting to register under the new procedures?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The final third will be from employers, trade
                unions and professional associations — which one might
                consider to be users. I welcome the fact that trade unions will
                be in a position to put forward names. One of the best
                presentations to the inquiry into residential and secure units
                for children was made by the Northern Ireland Public Service
                Alliance (NIPSA), which covers social services and social
                workers in particular. Since NIPSA is familiar with the pay
                levels, the conditions, the stress and the work of social
                workers, it is important that it be represented on this council.
                It is significant that we are discussing this issue at a time
                when social workers have found it necessary to go on strike in
                the Foyle area, following similar concerns in the north and west
                of Belfast. These matters are extremely important.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to have similar reassurance on
                the transitional arrangements for when GP fundholding ends. What
                will happen then?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill says that there will be no adverse
                impact on co-operation or common action under North/South or
                East/West relations. That is something that the Bill does speak
                to. It talks about European Economic Area (EEA) states and
                qualifications outside Northern Ireland. We need to turn that
                around and ask whether Northern Ireland qualifications are
                recognised abroad. This is an issue about professional
                qualifications. In some cases, for those who do not follow the
                undergraduate route in Northern Ireland, fewer years are spent
                studying than in other countries.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The question then arises of whether our
                social care workers will be able to practise elsewhere. This is
                not just about whether people coming in can practise here. There
                is an adverse effect. Those wishing to work in the Republic,
                Scotland, England or Wales are having their qualifications
                questioned because of the number of years’ of equivalent
                practice.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is the first time I have heard of
                hospitals producing charges or tariffs for the costs of
                operations. I am sure that that is the case, but is there a
                protocol that we could see? Is there further information on
                this? That is important.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister says that prescription fraud now
                costs £14 million, although the explanatory note says £12
                million. Have there been no savings from the introduction on the
                prescription charge which asks people to identify whether they
                are on benefits and, therefore, exempt from prescription
                charges?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McFarland:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On initial reading, I broadly welcome the
                Bill. I particularly welcome the setting up of the Social Care
                Council. It is notable that some 80% of social workers currently
                have no formal qualification. In recent years a small number of
                wayward social workers, particularly in Great Britain, have
                given the profession a bad name. I suspect that the new
                regulations, the recognition and the training will protect the
                profession and restore its good name.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In terms of GP fundholding, does the Minister
                plan to extend to Northern Ireland the proposals on contracts
                contained in Great Britain’s national plan? According to
                anecdotal evidence, certain GPs will never refuse to sign a sick
                note because they are paid according to the number of patients
                they have. If they refuse to sign the note, a patient will
                simply turn to another, willing GP. Likewise, few GPs will
                refuse to sign Disability Living Allowance forms. Such matters
                could, perhaps, be dealt with as part of this system.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the proposed widening of access to
                health trust meetings. At present, the public can attend a
                health board meeting but not a trust meeting. The new
                legislation will change this. I also welcome the thrust with
                which the appalling situation relating to trusts’ chief
                executives is being remedied. Earlier in the year, chief
                executives were leaving and paying themselves enormous sums of
                money. They were operating under contracts which allowed them to
                leave one job with large remuneration as compensation before
                taking a job elsewhere. That seems crazy. I look forward to
                examining this Bill in further detail in the Health Committee.
                Overall, I welcome it.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Perhaps a little learning is a dangerous
                thing, but I have some inside knowledge of the Health Service. I
                deeply regret that so much of the Bill should relate to
                bureaucracy and administration. The delivery of health care at
                the coalface is barely mentioned. Are the bureaucratic and
                administrative aspects of the Health Service our highest
                priority? The burning issue for people in the street — simple
                access to primary and secondary care — has been largely
                ignored. The Bill contains no plans to tackle the winter crisis,
                which is already upon us. Neither is there any mention of the
                fact that primary care, particularly community psychiatric care,
                is being bled dry.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is easy to pay lip service to good things
                and to condemn sin. However, we are making no significant
                improvement to the Health Service.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is that not an unfair list of criticisms to
                direct at this Bill? Many of us agree with those comments, but
                the same criticisms could be levelled at any piece of
                legislation, because one legal instrument will never be
                sufficient to cover every single problem in the system.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr McDonnell:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No matter which Bill is before us, we must
                prioritise carefully. The biggest priority is to ensure that
                there is adequate funding where people need it most — in
                primary care, where the most efficient and most cost-effective
                service can be delivered. In this Bill I detect an increase in
                bureaucracy, but I do not see the need to channel funds in this
                way.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to comment on the bungling that has
                been associated with the abandoning of fundholding. Fundholding
                was introduced by the Tories for all the wrong reasons. We can
                all jump up and down and be opposed to fundholding for all sorts
                of political or philosophical reasons. Many, including myself,
                were forced into the fundholding system in the hope that
                patients would get a better level of care.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We found — not for the reasons intended but
                almost by accident — that a by-product of fundholding was
                considerable benefit to patients. For the first time in the
                Health Service there was accountability, and that is saying
                something, because it had not been accountable for 50 years.
                Decisions were being made at the bedside or otherwise in the
                primary care setting. Choices could be offered to the patients,
                and small amounts at the edges — maybe 4% or 5% of the
                fundholding budget — were flexible and patients’ choices
                could be taken into account when meeting their needs. Perhaps
                most important of all, large monolithic extravagant hospitals
                were brought to account. If you want me to spell that out, I
                will. There were a number of benefits.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, we have now got rid of fundholding
                — or have we? It is somewhere out there in limbo, and nobody
                knows what is happening. It is going, and it is not going. It
                has gone, yet it has not quite gone. Everybody is waiting for
                something to happen. There is no provision, financial or
                otherwise, for winding up fundholding.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Shannon:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many things in this Bill are agreeable, and
                we will be glad for them to happen, but we have concerns about
                some parts. It is good that the Minister has appeared before the
                Assembly today. Can one hope that, last week, she was addressing
                the bed shortage at the Ulster Hospital or, perhaps, the long
                waiting lists for appointments, or the long hours that nurses
                and doctors have to work in all the hospitals — especially in
                the Ulster Hospital — or the staff shortages that we have?
                Perhaps that is the reason she was not here last week.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to address two issues. The first
                is in relation to the recovery of charges in connection with the
                treatment of road traffic casualties. Obviously there is a clear
                need to find a method for recovering the cost of treating
                injuries to these people, and the new arrangements are to be
                welcomed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The explanatory and financial memorandum
                states that recovery will be centralised and that the savings to
                the Health Service could amount to £3 million, compared to the
                £500,000 at present. The memorandum states — on page 21 —
                that there will be slight increases in insurance premiums. Will
                the Minister confirm that in the Department’s dealings with
                insurance companies — and we hope that it has dealt with them
                — any insurance increase will be focused on those responsible
                for the accidents and thereby the injuries. We all know that the
                statistics very clearly indicate that the largest number of
                accidents and injuries are caused by the boy and girl racers who
                can buy a car with two years’ free insurance. It would be
                encouraging for those who have to tax and insure their cars, and
                who find that the premiums rise regularly, to be sure that any
                future insurance increases were not directed against those who,
                by and large, do not have a record of problems and accidents.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also ask the Minister if the Health Service
                will be pursuing recovery for injuries from Republic of Ireland
                drivers who are involved in accidents in Northern Ireland. It
                would be a disgrace to find that such recovery could not be made
                from drivers in that jurisdiction. Has sufficient legislation
                been made to cover this eventuality?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would also like to address part IV of the
                Bill, which has direct implications for the pharmaceutical
                chemist. I have made it my business to speak to some chemists,
                and they expressed specific concern that they could be forced to
                sell, on prescription, the &quot;morning after pill&quot;, the
                PC4. Under this legislation, will chemists will be forced to
                make a moral decision? Some will neither stock, nor sell this
                pill.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.30 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Not enough research has been done on this,
                and chemists have a real concern that the pill will be taken off
                prescription and they will be asked to sell it over the counter.
                Will the Minister confirm that this will not happen? Not enough
                research has been done to determine if the effects of the pill
                could be detrimental.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Following hard on the abortion debate and the
                overwhelming vote against it, I urge the Department of Health to
                be cautious towards pharmaceutical chemists who will, generally,
                refuse to accept any directive or ruling from the Health
                Department. Will the Minister confirm her position on the PC4
                pill?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr J Kelly:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.
                Along with other members of the Health Committee, I give this
                stage of the Bill a broad welcome.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If a little learning is a dangerous thing, Dr
                McDonnell is not in much danger, judging by his contribution. I
                am not sure whether he is happy or disappointed with fundholding,
                or if other issues which he raised were not in the domain of
                another Minister, rather than the one who is with us today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome in particular clause 2, which
                defines a social care worker. Clauses 3 to 7 detail the
                procedure for registering social workers, and that is an
                important matter. Clause 8, relating to registration and
                enforcement, is also significant. Clause 9, which defines the
                codes of practice, is to be commended and, despite some
                reservations that I have, clauses 10 to 13, which refer to a
                training function for social workers, are also to be welcomed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Mr McFarland said, we are particularly
                happy that clause 54 provides for &quot;public access to
                meetings of certain bodies&quot;, as there is now no statutory
                requirement for health and social services bodies to open their
                meetings to the public. The Bill will make this a requirement,
                and we welcome that. We will also be looking at trust fund
                management and at how this Bill will make those responsible for
                trust funds accountable to the public in a way that they have
                not been before. We do not intend to allow the fat cats to get
                any fatter, and if they should happen to, they will have to be
                held accountable.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A LeasCheann Comhairle, at this stage we give
                a broad welcome to the Bill and look forward to further
                discussions on it.</p>

                leis na Teachtaí as ucht a suime sa díospóireacht ar an
                Bhille seo. Is ilghnéitheach iad forálacha an Bhille agus

                pointí suimiúla. Féachfaidh mé le plé leo uilig. Madam
                Deputy Speaker, I thank Members for their interest in the debate
                on this Bill. The provisions are diverse and represent changes
                to health and personal social services. Members raised a number
                of questions and made interesting points, and I shall endeavour
                to deal with all of them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We had questions about how the Social Care
                Council will be funded, about the appointments procedures and
                about representation on it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will move first to funding for the council.
                The cost of regulating the workforce will be met from annual
                fees paid by the registrants. A sliding scale of fees will take
                account of different pay scales and registration categories, and
                that is expected to bring in an annual income of at least
                £300,000 when all staff are on the register. At present,
                Government Departments fund the regulation of education and
                training through the provision of almost £500,000 to the
                Central Council for Education and Training in Social Work. These
                funds will be passed to the new council. It will also have the
                power to charge for other services. I do not see the new Social
                Care Council becoming a drain on resources and taking away from
                the value of health and social services. On the contrary, I see
                it adding value and improving quality in the health and social
                services field.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms McWilliams queried representation on the
                council. Decisions have not yet been made about the precise
                procedure for appointments. However, the selection process will
                be fully transparent, with all posts advertised and applications
                considered strictly on the basis of merit. Service users and lay
                members will make up a section of the council. One third will be
                drawn from registrants, and the others will come from
                employment, professional and education interests. Obviously, the
                registrants will be selected from people who will have been
                registered at that time. We can go into this point in further
                detail at a later date. In addition to advertising the posts, we
                will invite the representative bodies to nominate people who can
                bring the necessary skills and knowledge to the work of the
                council.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Berry asked a question about the fact that
                the Department may, by order, provide for a specified part of
                the register to be closed, so that, on or after a given date, no
                further persons can become registered in that part. He asked why
                this power was necessary and what impact it would have if people
                could not get on to the register. It is not envisaged that the
                part being closed will at any time be a part to which people
                would be seeking access. The power will allow the council to
                take account, over time, of the changing patterns of service
                provision. In the future, it may well be that certain categories
                of the social care workforce will no longer exist. This may
                apply to those working in educational or criminal justice
                settings. Let me give a clear example of this. If we had
                established a register 25 years ago, we would almost certainly
                have had a section of the register dedicated to hospital
                almoners. Such a category would not be appropriate today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have dealt with most of the questions that
                have been raised about the council. Ms McWilliams also asked
                whether there would be a delay between the standing down of the
                Central Council for Education and Training in Social Work and
                the introduction of the new council. That will not be the case.
                The legislation provides for a shadow body until the council can
                be formally established. Members of the shadow body will also be
                selected through full appointment procedures. The shadow body
                will make the necessary preparations to facilitate a smooth
                transfer of responsibilities to the new body. This has been very
                clearly laid out, so there should be no hiatus or vacuum.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Ramsey asked about the recognition of
                qualifications gained elsewhere. The Central Council for
                Education and Training in Social Work is working closely with
                the equivalent body in the South of Ireland to examine social
                work training and to facilitate opportunities for cross-border
                placements. Very clear guidelines are also in place which will
                ensure that people here can obtain qualifications which will
                allow them access to employment elsewhere.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Berry also asked about the equivalence of
                qualifications. The National Training Organisation for Personal
                Social Services is working with employers to identify the skills
                required to deliver a quality service. The outcome of the
                consultation will dictate which qualifications are recognised.
                These will include the full range of qualifications and not just
                the NVQs and the professional qualifications that are recognised
                now.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At present, there is no agreed code of
                practice. Social care is so important to so many people that
                specific codes of conduct and practice are needed. We intend to
                introduce codes so that social care workers and their managers
                are clear about what is expected of them and to enable the
                public to see clearly the standards to which these staff must
                work. The four agencies who are working together on this, and
                who would have been previously represented, have commissioned a
                project to draw up draft codes of conduct and practice. This
                will be issued for consultation with the full range of
                stakeholders here. The Social Care Council will make the final
                codes widely available.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, I note with satisfaction that
                several Members, including Rev Robert Coulter and Ms Ramsey,
                mentioned the dedication, commitment and hard work of social
                workers here. We ought to pay tribute to those working in the
                social care field. As Members have said, the imminent
                establishment of the Social Care Council has been widely
                welcomed by such people precisely because of their dedication
                and high standards.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I turn to the questions regarding the
                recovery of money following road traffic accidents. The Rev
                Robert Coulter said that the means to recover such money should
                have been introduced some time ago. The power to recover money
                from insurance companies has existed for some time under the
                Road Traffic Act. However, this new legislation will provide for
                a streamlined and less bureaucratic system, as well as an
                increase in the recoverable amounts to a level which more
                closely reflects cost. I am pleased that the Member has welcomed
                these new streamlining arrangements, which are indeed timely.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have two points in response to Mr Berry’s
                question about whether it is only those with insurance who will
                pay. The impact on actual insurance premiums is not thought to
                be significant. An alteration of between £6 and £9 a year is
                being considered. It is the insurance companies which will be
                affected, and it will be for the insurance industry to determine
                how its customers are charged. The legislation will have an
                impact on those who cover insured drivers and on uninsured
                drivers. The introduction of the Motor Insurers Bureau into the
                scheme means that compensation will be paid in cases where a
                driver has no insurance.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Shannon asked if the Department would
                recover compensation from drivers from the South. The Department
                has consulted fully with the insurance industry in developing
                the legislative proposals, but it will not recover compensation
                from drivers from the South.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I turn to the measures being taken to tackle
                the evasion of Health Service charges, prescription charges and
                fraud by National Health Service family practitioners.</p>
                <i>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms McWilliams queried whether dispensing
                checks had in fact brought any measurable benefit. Dispensing
                checks have had some success, and it is estimated that the
                income collected as a result has increased by approximately
                £1&nbsp;million this year. However, this does not obviate our
                difficulties and the need to introduce further measures.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;McCarthy asked about reducing
                prescription charges. This Bill tackles the specific problem of
                the evasion of these charges, so that issue is outside its
                jurisdiction. A wide range of exemptions from charges is in
                place to protect people who may have difficulty paying or who
                have special needs. As part of my plans to ensure that the
                Department fully meets its equality obligations under the
                Northern Ireland Act 1998, I will be looking at the equality
                implications of Health Service charges in due course, but the
                matter is not relevant to today’s Bill.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms&nbsp;Ramsey indicated the need to
                investigate institutional fraud in nursing homes, GP practices,
                dental surgeries and so on. The Department is already taking
                action to detect and prevent fraud in all areas. All health and
                personal social service organisations are required to have fraud
                response plans in place. I have established a counter-fraud unit
                in the Central Services Agency to assist boards in the
                investigation of potential fraud in family practitioner
                services. GP claims are subject to post-payment validation
                checks, and similar checks are undertaken for pharmacists,
                dentists and opticians. Members will note that the clauses in
                this Bill relate not only to individuals but also to Health
                Service practices.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall now turn to the questions from
                Dr&nbsp;Hendron, Mr&nbsp;Berry and Ms&nbsp;Ramsey on the timing
                of the new arrangements for primary care. I intend to publish
                proposals for those new arrangements for formal consultation in
                the near future. I agree that it is important to learn from the
                lessons of fundholding and from other models of primary care
                commissioning. I make a point of working on the lessons of the
                past and building on positive experiences from the past when
                developing new arrangements. We must also ensure that those new
                arrangements reflect local circumstances.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McFarland asked about GP contracts. I am
                aware that preliminary proposals to amend GP contracts are
                emerging from the NHS plan in England, and I will study those
                proposals closely and follow that debate. I will introduce new
                arrangements here only if it is appropriate to do so, given our
                local circumstances.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr McDonnell asked about fundholding. I
                accept that there were positive aspects to fundholding, and I
                will attempt to build on those. However, in general, Members
                will agree that it is time to end GP fundholding.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the question of chief executives’ pay, I
                recognise the problems highlighted by Mr&nbsp;McFarland. The
                Audit Office published a report recently in response to those
                problems and identified important lessons for setting contracts
                and regulating termination payments. Although they came to
                attention earlier this year, these problems arose a number of
                years ago. I want to ensure that they do not reoccur and that
                the powers of direction contained in this Bill will facilitate
                the introduction of fair and open arrangements.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to address Dr McDonnell’s question
                on accessing services. I know there are difficulties in
                accessing services, but the problems identified by the Member
                concern resources, which are a priority for me. However, they
                are not concerned with legislation, which is why they are not
                being dealt with today. That is not to suggest, however, that
                they are not being dealt with at all.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Tá súil agam gur chlúdaigh mé iomlán na
                bpointí a luadh, ach gabhaim mo leithscéal má d’fhág mé

                questions, and I look forward to further discussions with

                Clause 65, subsection 3 of the Child Support, Pensions and
                Social Security Bill will give the courts the power to force
                children under the age of 16 to give a blood sample to establish
                paternity through DNA testing. I have reservations about this
                section of the Bill. A child of 14 or 15 who has never known his
                father could be forced to give a blood sample. Is this child to
                be held down and forced to give that blood to determine his
                paternity?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the person with care and control of that
                child does not believe that it is in the child’s best interest
                to give blood, surely we should respect that view. To force a
                child to give a blood sample is a violation of the child’s
                rights. Allowance for the child’s age and understanding should
                be incorporated in the Bill, taking the child’s needs into
                consideration.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister has written to my Colleague, Sue
                Ramsey, to say that he cannot guarantee that the sample will be
                destroyed after the test has been conducted. We should not allow
                this clause to go unchallenged.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This would be the same as having that young
                person’s DNA sample on record for life, and it could be used
                to convict him or her years later. That would be a breach of his
                or her civil liberties, and we cannot allow this clause in the
                Bill to go through without amendment. Go raibh maith agat, a

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ford:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I share Ms Gildernew’s concerns, but I
                shall not repeat them at great length. I wrote to the Minister
                some time ago about where this section of this Bill impinged on
                the Family Law Reform Bill. He responded that that was a matter
                for another Minister, but there is clearly a problem when we
                have two related Bills going through, one of which is being
                treated as a parity measure and as though all discussion on it
                is impossible. Yet again, as with some of the clauses we debated
                last week, easy reading of the Bill does not make for easy
                recognition of the rights of a child, and these rights are not
                necessarily the same as the rights of those seeking to enforce
                financial payments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister will tell us that as this is a
                matter of parity we should accept it, but that is not a good
                enough answer. Perhaps he could indicate whether it will be
                difficult to force the courts to take into account the views of
                the child in a case such as this, or whether it will merely be
                best practice for the courts to do so anyway. Will he give us a
                specific assurance that he is confident that it has passed the
                test of the ECHR (European Convention on Human Rights), because
                I am anything but confident that that is the case?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Morrow:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have listened to the points that have been
                made, and if I seem slightly confused, I suspect the House will
                forgive me. The arguments put forward in support of the
                amendment, while I understand the sentiments, are based on a
                misunderstanding.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Under the existing law a blood sample cannot
                be taken from a child under 16 to determine paternity without
                the consent of the person who has care and control of the child.
                Normally such consent is given, but there are cases where it is
                not forthcoming. In a recent High Court judgement, the judge
                expressed the view that the existing law may not comply with the
                ECHR in that it can deny the child the opportunity to know its
                paternity. It is unsatisfactory that the person with care and
                control of the child, who may well be a party to the
                proceedings, should be able to frustrate those proceedings and
                prevent the child’s paternity from being established. This can
                have the effect of denying the child the right to know his
                father, and the father the right to be recognised as such.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The provision therefore focuses on the best
                interests of the child when deciding whether to give a direction
                for tests to establish paternity. The court has the flexibility
                to distinguish between cases where establishing paternity is in
                a child’s best interests and those where it may not be. Where
                the court considers that the child is old enough to express a
                view, it will take that view into account when reaching its
                decision. Clause 65(3) amends article 9 of the Family Law Reform
                (Northern Ireland) Order 1977 to allow a court to permit the
                taking of a sample where it considers it to be in the best
                interests of the child. This will ensure that directions given
                in the best interest of the child can be effectively enforced
                and that the law in this area complies with the ECHR.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Turning to the amendment, the court will take
                account of a range of issues, including the age and
                understanding of the child, when considering whether or not to
                make a direction. Therefore, the amendment is unnecessary.
                However, the amendment, as drafted — and I cannot believe that
                the Member intended this — could have the adverse effect of
                fettering the court’s powers. If the amendment were to be
                accepted, a court could interpret the legislation as allowing it
                to take account of the age and understanding of the child only,
                but of no other factors.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I cannot believe that that is what the Member
                intends. In view of the fact that the court will, as a matter of
                course, take account of the age and understanding of the child,
                and given the possible unintended implications of the amendment,
                I ask the Member to withdraw it. However, if the Member feels
                unable to do so, I must ask the House to reject it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Regarding the destruction of samples used for
                DNA testing, I have written to the Member who raised that issue
                to confirm that samples are destroyed, normally after three
                months, although that period can be extended, for example, where
                the test results are challenged.</p>

                statutory walking distance of his or her home. The definition of

                controlled, Catholic maintained, integrated and Irish-medium
                schools and, in the grammar school sector, denominational and

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Education is concerned
                about the safety of our children. It is essential that everybody
                charged with responsibility for the safety of children —
                either at school or when transporting them to and from school
                — is conscious of the need to ensure that children are looked
                after and educated about the need for public safety.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to the safety of children who

                carrying capacity of vehicles is the responsibility of the
                Department of the Environment. Education and library board and
                other providers of home-to-school transport operate within the
                terms of that legislation. I am aware that the Environment
                Committee is to hold a formal inquiry into transport for
                schoolchildren which will include consideration of the
                legislation governing the number of children permitted to travel

                public concern about how schoolchildren are obliged to stand on
                school buses. He will realise that this is worse in rural areas
                where schoolchildren travel distances of 20 to 25 miles for
                their secondary-level education. Will future developments for
                school transport address the issue? Would it not be circumspect
                for the Minister to issue a directive to all education and
                library boards to impose a moratorium on all carriers forbidding
                schoolchildren from standing on buses until a full inquiry has
                been completed?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not wish to repeat myself. I made it
                clear that legislation regarding the carrying capacity of
                vehicles, indeed everything to do with safety on buses, is the
                responsibility of the Department of the Environment. It is not
                that of the Department of Education. It is important that the
                formal inquiry into transport that the Environment Committee
                intends to hold takes place as soon as possible. That inquiry
                will consider all those matters, and the Department of Education
                keenly awaits the outcome. Any decisions taken by the Minister
                of the Environment, or any advice offered by the Environment
                Committee, must be taken seriously by my Department. We have a
                huge responsibility, first to see the outcome of that inquiry
                and, secondly, to consider its full implications. Many Members
                are concerned about that issue, including myself. That is the
                most sensible way to proceed.</p>

                escorts for children with special needs. At present that package
                has been delivered to the escorts. How long will it be before
                drivers are also offered that training package? Also, will the
                Minister’s Department consider offering that training to the
                private sector and encourage that sector to become involved in
                that training by extending contracts from one year to three

                fact that we are dealing with children who, in some

                highest quality of training available, and I will ensure, from
                the perspective of the Department of Education, that all
                relevant authorities involved in the safety and proper provision
                of school transport adhere rigidly to the training.</p>

                Does the Minister agree that the rigid application of the school
                transport policy restricts rather than helps choice? This is
                particularly true in the case of those parents who can least
                afford school transport. Their choice of a particular school is
                adversely affected by the transport policy since they cannot
                pass a school that is deemed by the Department of Education to
                be suitable for them. Does he also agree that examination of
                this policy is required in order to give people a wider choice,
                particularly in relation to secondary or grammar schools in
                rural areas?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr M McGuinness:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is clearly a sensitive issue, and the
                Department has dealt with a number of letters from parents who
                have sought this particular facility for some time. Applications
                are often refused simply because it has been decided that the
                code is the most sensible way of ensuring that as many children
                as possible can avail themselves of the facility.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Everyone knows that transport costs have been
                a heavy burden on the Department. Over the 1996-97 period there
                was an increase of £7·8 million, and last year we spent around
                £46·2 million. We are concerned about the increasing cost of
                home-to-school transport and the detrimental effect that this
                has had on the resources available in the classroom.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The current policy on nearest suitable
                schools was introduced to reduce the numbers eligible for
                transport with the aim of containing the rising costs and
                directing more resources to schools. It is important that people
                recognise and understand that this is an expensive issue and one
                that uses up considerable resources within the Department.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For the purposes of transport arrangements
                the term &quot;suitable school&quot; has a precise definition,
                and, as I said earlier, relates to the established educational
                categories of controlled, maintained, integrated and Irish
                medium schools and also to the grammar sector — both
                denominational and non-denominational.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Transport assistance will be provided to a
                school that is outside the statutory walking distance in a
                chosen category provided that there are no similar schools
                within statutory walking distance to which the pupil could have
                been admitted. People need to consider that if that measure were
                to be relaxed, the Department would be faced with the huge
                problem of having to direct elsewhere the much needed resources
                that it is trying to direct into the classroom. That would have
                a detrimental effect on our education system.</p>

                paper to protect a school and children — that is unacceptable.
                I want to know why the Department appears to have learned
                nothing from this pernicious and evil attack on a school in my
                constituency. Why has it learned nothing from other attacks on
                schools in other constituencies? I want to know what resources
                and strategy the Minister is going to put in place to protect

                when I say this: when you appoint a terrorist to a position in
                the Government of Northern Ireland, it is little wonder that
                there is a drop in standards in education.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr M McGuinness:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The law places responsibility for health and
                safety on the employer, in this case the school authority.
                However, I take the issue of school security very seriously and
                my Department has issued guidance to schools on the development
                and implementation of a school security policy. Employing
                authorities have an important responsibility for ensuring that
                their schools are safe and secure for staff and pupils. As well
                as having security strategies they should ensure that risk
                assessments are undertaken to enable security needs to be
                identified and addressed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I recognise that it is difficult for
                authorities to guarantee school security under all circumstances
                and there are limits to what can be sensibly done to protect
                against the most extreme incidents. A proper balance must be
                struck between making schools secure and keeping them
                accessible.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Over the course of the last four years my
                Department has made available additional resources of some £4
                million, specifically for basic security measures in schools.
                The measures have taken the form of access controls on doors to
                control visitor access, internal audio and visual monitoring
                systems and intruder alarms. The measures are largely directed
                towards personal protection of staff and pupils and are
                determined on the basis of risk assessments carried out by
                individual schools. These are in addition to more significant
                capital works undertaken by boards and individual schools to
                protect school buildings. These take the form of fencing, CCTV,
                external security lighting, security grilles on windows and the
                provision of security stores. This followed on from the many
                lessons that were learned in the aftermath of the fatal stabbing
                of the headteacher, Philip Lawrence, in England. We always have
                to be conscious and aware of our responsibilities to schools, to
                the people who work in them and to the young people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is also important to point out that during
                the summer quite a number of schools were attacked in the north
                Antrim area. I was very pleased to see that the Paisleys — Mr
                Ian Paisley Snr and Mr Ian Paisley Jnr — have at long last
                decided to say something about that. That is an encouraging
                development because at one of the schools that was attacked the
                board of governors was actually meeting when someone threw a
                petrol bomb into the school. There was not a cheep out of Mr

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The accommodation needs of rural schools,
                like those of all schools, are addressed by my Department’s
                capital prioritisation arrangements. These give high priority to
                the replacement of rural schools that are currently operating in
                sub-standard accommodation. It is important that rural
                communities have a network of strong local schools with the
                necessary accommodation, equipment and range of teaching
                experience. On the rationalisation of rural schools, I will wish
                to be satisfied that every option has been examined in
                consultation with parents and the community before making any
                decisions on closures.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr B Bell:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I note from the Minister’s reply that he
                shares some of my concerns. How does he intend to ensure that
                school facilities in rural areas are maintained and improved? Do
                the capital building priorities address this problem?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr M McGuinness:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In previous Question Time discussions I have
                made it clear that rural schools, and small rural schools in
                particular, make a huge contribution to community life. Anybody
                who knows me will know how greatly I value this contribution. To
                progress this issue, it is vital that consultation takes place
                involving local communities, school authorities, boards of
                governors, school principals, teachers and parents. It is
                crucial to get this right. In the course of our deliberations on
                school capital funding programmes and on suggestions or
                proposals for rationalisation we must ensure that we move
                forward sensibly on this issue. It is of great concern to
                people, particularly those living in rural areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The rural nature of this area, and the
                structure of education here, means that there will be a
                significant number of small rural schools. The accommodation
                needs of these schools are met via the Department’s capital
                prioritisation arrangements. There are limited funds available
                for new school building schemes each year, so only high-priority
                projects can proceed in planning. This includes the replacement
                of those rural schools currently located in sub-standard
                accommodation. Following completion of an economic appraisal,
                the planning of a project is permitted to proceed to enable the
                scheme to compete for funding under the annual new starts
                programme. It is important to appreciate the huge contribution
                that such schools have made. It is vital that we move forward
                sensibly, bearing in mind that resources are limited.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Education Committee
                (Mr&nbsp;Kennedy):</b> Given the high levels of need experienced
                by rural schools, what proactive measures — and we have heard
                much in extremely general terms in the earlier replies — does
                the Minister intend to take to address this problem?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr M McGuinness:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Education considers it
                important that rural communities have access to a network of
                strong local schools with the necessary accommodation, equipment
                and range of teaching experience to provide a broad and balanced
                curriculum.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A strong rural school has advantages in the
                range of the curriculum, the expertise of the staff, the
                educational benefits of single-age-group classes, enhanced
                interaction for pupils and teachers, and more curricular
                activities. In moving this issue forward and ensuring that a
                proper locally based education is provided in small rural
                communities, we must take account of the limited finances and
                resources available. Many small primary schools throughout the
                North are over 100 years old. There is huge pressure on the
                Department in terms of what can be achieved in any given period.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For example, the largest ever capital
                building programme for schools was announced at the beginning of
                this year — £70 million. I have made it clear that when one
                considers the problems and difficulties that exist, this is only
                a drop in the ocean, and there are few in the House who would
                disagree. As a result, there has been a debate about
                rationalisation in education: how to improve facilities and
                conditions for children, parents, teachers and school
                authorities, and how to do that sensibly with the available
                resources. It will be difficult, and it will not be possible to
                please everybody.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department is looking proactively at the
                issue of rural schools, particularly small rural schools. We
                appreciate the contribution that they make. There are a number
                of outstanding proposals before my Department, on which I expect
                to announce decisions over the next few weeks. People will find
                these decisions are an interesting departure from previous
                policy.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I again remind Members to keep their
                questions and answers relatively brief. There are still a number
                of questions to be put.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Gallagher:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The importance of small schools has quite
                rightly been stressed. Nowhere is that more important than in
                the west of the Province, especially in the Western Education
                and Library Board area, which has the highest number of small
                schools of all the boards. From Hallowe’en, canteen staff in
                some small schools in the Western Education and Library Board
                area will have their hours cut because fewer children are taking
                school meals because of increased meal prices from 1 September
                at primary and secondary school level. Given the serious
                implications of that issue, will the Minister consider a review
                of all aspects of this decision, including the provision of free
                school milk for families on income support in all board areas?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Member:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. That
                question is not relevant.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will take points of order after Question
                Time, but on this occasion I will ask the Minister whether he
                considers that question relevant to Question 3.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr M McGuinness:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is not relevant to the question before us
                today, but it is a relevant question. It is one that should
                concern us. Members will be aware that the education and library
                boards have the key responsibility for the cost of school meals.
                The Department can only do so much.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Again, this question relates to the level of
                available resources and whether we are pushing as much finance
                as possible straight towards our children’s education in an
                attempt to ensure that resources are classroom-based, as opposed
                to the other difficulties. We must give serious consideration to
                the matters raised by Mr Gallagher. I am involved in ongoing
                discussions with the education and library boards about these
                issues.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy Chairperson of the Education
                Committee (Mr S Wilson):</b> Perhaps, Mr Deputy Speaker, you
                will inform the Minister that although this is described as
                Question Time, it requires that some answers be given to the
                House.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yes, I do, and I would like an answer to the
                question. My preamble is to ensure that we do get an answer.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister has told us that he thinks that
                this is an important issue and that he is going to give it
                serious consideration. Perhaps he would tell us what he intends
                to do to help rural schools. Secondly, will he give this House
                an assurance that in this year’s capital spending programme we
                will not see the same bias as we saw last year when the money
                went in favour of maintained schools at a ratio of four to one?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr M McGuinness:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The last comment is totally inaccurate, as
                usual — we should not be surprised about that. The reality is
                that the school capital building programme, which I announced at
                the beginning of this year, was very well received, and there
                was very little criticism, even from the Member’s own party,
                at the time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One thing is certain in the Department of
                Education, over which I have stewardship: under no circumstances
                will any community be treated the way the community that I come
                from has been treated over the course of 70 to 80 years under
                British rule.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is also vital to state that my Department
                is committed to ensuring support for small rural schools and for
                education in the rural community. A number of issues are
                currently before me, and I will take decisions on those over the
                next couple of weeks. The decisions taken will clearly
                demonstrate — better than any answer I can give in this House
                — that I am absolutely committed to the preservation of the
                rural community and of education within the rural community.</p>

                the school in Strabane. My Department is currently preparing a
                submission for my consideration which will examine the key
                educational, structural and management factors involved, as well
                as taking account of the objections raised. The issue that the
                Member mentioned will, of course, have a huge impact not only in
                Strabane but also in areas all over the North.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">By the end of this month I hope to announce
                the composition of the review body that will be charged to take
                forward what I consider to be the most important debate on
                education that we have had in 100 years. I hope that the review
                body will come back to me by May 2001 with definite proposals as
                to how this should be taken forward. Of course, all of this will
                impact not only on the development proposals for Strabane but
                also on schools throughout the North.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We will make a decision on the Strabane
                proposal soon, and we will continue with the debate into
                post-primary education. I hope that at the end of that process
                we can come forward with proposals that will allow us manage the
                whole issue of post-primary education in a way that benefits all
                our children.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The question refers to the major
                reorganisation of schools in Strabane. The Minister has
                addressed the issue of the maintained sector and a particular
                problem in Strabane. However, I also understand that last year
                the board of governors of Strabane Grammar School entered into
                discussions with the Western Education and Library Board and the
                Department with regard to the school’s long-term accommodation
                needs and that various options were to be investigated and
                costed. Can the Minister update the Assembly on the current
                situation of Strabane Grammar School which, to quote its
                principal, &quot;urgently needs a new-build programme to bring
                it into the twenty-first century&quot;?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Discussions are taking place, and have taken
                place, between the officials of Strabane Grammar School and
                representatives from the Western Education and Library Board. We
                are very concerned about the state of the schools estate
                throughout the North, not just in Strabane Grammar School, and
                it is vitally important that we deal with this in a sensible
                way.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Education believes that the
                announcement of the school capital building programme at the
                beginning of 2001 will go some way towards alleviating the
                difficulties of many schools throughout the North. However,
                there is an added consideration now as a result of the pilot
                schemes that have taken place with relation to the private
                finance initiative approach. The Department of Education is also
                considering how it can take that initiative forward in order to
                enhance the quality of accommodation at different schools
                throughout the North. When one considers the huge legacy of
                neglect and underfunding, I am sure Members will agree that that
                is the sensible approach.</p>

                NHS Direct a thabhairt isteach anseo. Bheadh £3 milliún sa
                bhliain air dá dtabhairfimis a léithid de scéim isteach

                ar acmhainní na seirbhísí sláinte atá san iomaíocht léi.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have no plans to introduce NHS&nbsp;Direct
                here at present. The introduction of an equivalent scheme here
                would cost around £3&nbsp;million per year. I am not convinced
                that it would give the best value for money, bearing in mind the
                other competing bids for Health Service resources.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am most dissatisfied with that answer. Is
                the Minister aware of the Modernising Government annual report
                2000, ‘Putting Citizens First’, in which the nursing
                director of NHS&nbsp;Direct in Hampshire says that she is saving
                lives and that figures show that around 43% of callers have been
                helped directly without having to leave their homes? This
                service would benefit the entire community in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland. I ask the Minister to reassess her
                position carefully and to look again at where she is spending
                the money in order to find this £3&nbsp;million.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Perhaps if the Minister stopped spending
                money on speaking Irish and on issuing press releases in Irish
                and spent it on the patients, we could afford this service.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Officials have read and analysed the recent
                review of the operation of NHS&nbsp;Direct in England. This
                contains a variety of factual information but the summary
                assessment of NHS Direct’s performance merely says that it may
                be beginning to achieve the policy objectives for which it was
                designed. Officials and board colleagues have also visited
                Scotland, information has been obtained from Wales, and the
                different approaches are being discussed. However, we need to
                ensure that we identify the most appropriate way forward to suit
                local circumstances and that we do that within the resources
                available to us, not the resources available to England, the
                resources available to Scotland or the resources available to
                Wales. As I have pointed out on several occasions, all of these
                are greater than the resources available for the Health Service
                here.</p>

                covered by it. Does the Minister not agree that it is a poor
                reflection on her stewardship of health care here that this
                successful innovation has not yet been implemented in Northern
                Ireland?</p>

                are differences in approach in Scotland and England. I am
                determined to ensure that the public here gets the best services
                possible given the resources available, and that means assessing
                relative priorities to ensure resources are targeted on the
                greatest needs. We need to ensure that the type of service we
                have is the most appropriate one for our local circumstances.
                That could include, for example, nurse triage to support better
                self-help, or more appropriate referrals to the various branches
                of the Health Service, in particular GPs, out-of-hours and
                hospital accident and emergency services.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I said, I am not convinced that even if
                all the resources elsewhere were to become available to me,
                spending £300 million a year on NHS Direct would give the best
                value for money, and specifically not when bearing in mind the

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am informed that Down Lisburn Trust has
                sought to address pressures within its acute hospital programme
                in the current year through a temporary transfer of funds from
                the mental health, disability and community care programmes. As
                a result, some £100,000 has been transferred from the mental
                health programme, and a similar amount has been transferred from
                the other two programmes. That is less than 1% of the total
                mental health services spend. There have been no other material
                transfers of funds to other programmes over the past five years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am also informed that the trust hopes to
                restore the funding to mental health services next year, subject
                to resource availability. All of this, as I would remind
                Members, happens within the context wherein Scotland spends
                £128 more per head each year on health and social services and
                Wales spends 51% more per person, per year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have been assured that the trust remains
                committed to the delivery of high-quality mental health
                services, as demonstrated by the recruitment of an additional
                six consultants in mental health services over the past five
                years.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In light of the concerns expressed, in
                particular by GPs in the Lisburn area, about access to emergency
                psychiatric beds, it seems that mental health is always seen as
                the poor relation. If cuts are to be made, they are usually made
                in mental health services first. Does the Minister not agree
                that it is entirely inappropriate for Down Lisburn Trust to
                divert £150,000 from the mental health care programme to other
                programmes within that trust over the past 12 months?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I refer the Member to my previous answer. As
                regards spending on mental health services, overall expenditure
                on those services here has risen from £93·7 million in 1995-6
                to £114·7 million in 1998-9, which is an increase of 22%.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Notwithstanding that, I have made it clear
                that I believe there is a need for a significant increase in
                spending across all programmes of care if the needs of the
                population are to be fully met.</p>

                to review the role of health trusts and replace them with

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree that once you start a practice like
                this, it does continue. However, one of the problems with
                ring-fencing — which is, of course, the other way of tackling
                this problem, to ensure that transfers cannot be made — is
                that the flexibility to deal with emergencies is not there. If
                it became clear that certain services were constantly losing,
                and losing substantially, to other aspects of the service, I
                would immediately take action. However, where emergencies arise
                and there is a temporary transfer of funds which is clearly
                intended to be replaced and is not a large-scale pattern, the
                matter needs to be left open to those on the ground dealing with

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given that we had a crisis last January, to
                hear that the meeting only took place on 16 October causes me
                some concern. I am not sure whether it is because I wrote to the
                Minister a few days earlier.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">United Hospitals Trust has had a proposal for
                20 additional medical beds in Antrim Hospital for the past 18
                months, but no action has yet been taken by the Northern Health
                and Social Services Board. Is the Minister aware of that?
                Presumably, she is aware of the Eastern Health and Social
                Services Board report that an additional 100 medical beds are
                needed in Belfast hospitals. I know where the extra intensive
                care beds are, but could the Minister please tell us where extra
                medical beds have been provided since last January? They are
                needed to deal with a crisis that will inevitably blow up within
                two months at most?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms de Brún:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member will be aware that I commissioned
                two reviews immediately after last winter’s pressures; one was
                into the availability of intensive care beds and the other was
                into community care. That resulted in the report ‘Facing the
                Future’, which came out during suspension. The report included
                specific measures and timetables, and I have consistently
                followed up on progress with boards and trusts and reported to
                the House. The suggestion that I met the boards to review
                progress only on 16 October is completely and utterly
                unacceptable and does not reflect the situation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Board plans have included a number of
                measures, including extra beds, that will be put in place. Each
                board will have detailed plans as to where those beds will be.
                This winter, boards plan to introduce around 300 additional
                hospital beds to cope with likely pressures. They will also have
                about 1,000 additional community care places this winter. That
                figure includes intermediate care schemes to reduce the need for
                inappropriate hospital admissions, as well as schemes to ensure
                that people who do not need to be in hospital can be discharged.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am aware of the problems facing hospitals.
                I have made it clear to the board chairman that plans must take
                account of the pressures facing specific hospitals before I will
                approve them. Following my meeting on 16 October, at which
                planned measures were discussed in detail, I asked my officials
                to take up a number of issues with the boards, including the
                impact of current pressures on hospitals.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I remind the Minister that a substantial
                number of people want to ask questions, and we are only now at

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the Minister said, outbreaks of flu play a
                critical part in the annual beds crisis. Obviously, vaccination
                of Health Service employees, to avoid staff shortages at such a
                critical time of the year, would help with that to some extent,
                but which institution would carry the cost of such vaccination?
                We should ensure that GP surgeries and hospital trusts have a
                financial incentive to vaccinate staff against flu to ensure
                that workers are available at peak times of demand in the
                winter.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Boards and trusts have taken on board the
                issue of vaccinating Health Service staff. We have dealt with
                the question of the uptake of flu vaccination for the over-65s,
                and officials are now discussing with trusts the progress made
                in encouraging staff to take up the vaccination. There is a
                clear incentive for trusts and GP surgeries to ensure that staff
                are vaccinated, so that the full complement of employees is
                there to cope with winter pressures.</p>

                In recent years — particularly last year — one of the major
                causes of the winter pressures was elderly people falling on
                ungritted footpaths. Has the Minister any plans to meet the
                relevant Minister to discuss how the dispute between local
                councils and the Department of the Environment about

                my Department’s remit. Indeed, some of the measures that could
                be taken to improve the health of the population are not solely
                the responsibility of my Department either.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I look forward to the full co-operation of my
                Executive Colleagues in helping to ensure that all measures come

                importantly, information should be provided to children who may
                face abuse in their own homes as well as abuse outside. We are

                it should not happen and that it should stop. As to whether the
                judiciary as opposed to the rule of law is the only avenue, some
                people prefer to deal with social services, with groups such as
                community-based restorative justice, or with women’s
                organisations or others. If people in local areas find that
                members of their families have allegations of abuse against
                others and wish to use other avenues, I will certainly not
                dictate and say that there is only one way in which to deal with
                such a matter. However, any approach has to be within the law,
                within human rights norms, and in the interests of the child or
                the person who is alleging the abuse.</p>

                improvement to, the provision of cancer services here, similar
                to plans announced recently in England, is already under way.
                The programme, which is well advanced, includes the development
                of a regional cancer centre in Belfast, as well as cancer units
                at Antrim Area Hospital, Craigavon Area Hospital, Altnagelvin
                Area Hospital and the Ulster Hospital. Radiotherapy and
                chemotherapy services currently provided at Belvoir Park will be
                relocated to Belfast City Hospital, where a state-of-the-art
                oncology centre will be built. Work on this project is on course
                to be completed by 2003. To support this programme of work, a
                further £8 million has been allocated this year.</p>

                an interim CSF monitoring committee was established,

                structural funds monitoring committees, to be established under
                the EU regulations, might be composed and structured. The
                conclusions reached by the working group, and endorsed by the
                interim CSF monitoring committee, were presented to the
                Executive Committee in July, which approved the size of the
                sectors to be represented on each of the three monitoring
                committees. These are the community support framework monitoring
                committee, the Peace II monitoring committee and the committee
                on transitional Objective 1. My Department then invited
                nominations from a wide range of interests, including local

                that I am in favour of the establishment of an Ad Hoc Committee
                of the House to look at these points. This applies not least in
                relation to Peace II — all parties in this House are eager to
                guarantee the distinctiveness and the additionality of the
                programme. I explained this to the Finance and Personnel
                Committee.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All parties in this House were also members
                of the interim community support framework monitoring committee.
                There was a fairly desultory pattern of attendance at its
                meetings, and the proposals that came forward from the working

                helping to regenerate urban and rural communities, over the past

                are important for the administration of European-funded
                programmes, particularly the Peace programme? Given the merits
                of the district partnership model in Peace I, can the Minister

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I recognise the value of the EU programmes to
                the whole region and to particular localities. However, I
                particularly recognise the value of the special and distinctive
                role played by local delivery mechanisms, not least by the
                district partnerships and the work they foster and sponsor. The
                Executive wants to see this role develop under the Peace II
                programme. Therefore we are trying to ensure that these
                mechanisms can evolve into more strategic development
                partnerships at each district level, furthering the existing
                partnership between local government and social partners, and
                representing community interests on district partnerships.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive Committee is determined to
                secure primary allocations for the district partnerships, and
                also to promote local delivery through those measures that
                Departments themselves will administer and deliver. The

                ensuring that Departments employ local delivery mechanisms in
                social inclusion measures — particularly for women, children
                and young people — and in cross-border measures. These
                concerns are very much at the top of the Executive agenda as we

                million to assist the voluntary and community sectors involved
                in Peace I and other EU structural funds over this period. That
                assistance was made available through the Department for Social

                problems I would appreciate their making it available to my

                Nonetheless, we want to continue to monitor problems, and the

                in ways that ensure the sustainability of these models and
                mechanisms beyond the Peace II programme. I do not believe in

                biodegradable containers for carrying money on a temporary basis
                from Europe. If we are serious about these models, we need to

                vital and important work that developed under Peace I.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Finance and Personnel
                Committee (Mr Molloy): </b>Last week, when the Committee met a
                delegation of district partnership boards, there was still quite
                a gap in funding. A number of people who had applied for funding
                from the last round, particularly from the Department for Social
                Development, had been refused, and we have asked them to forward
                those applications to the Minister so that he can assess the
                current need.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Mr Molloy for the helpful direction
                he gave to the groups who were in front of the Committee last
                week. The more solid information we have, the more helpful it
                is. All the money in Peace I has been allocated, but not all of
                it has been drawn down and it needs to be spent before December
                2001. We are encouraging everyone with a direct interest to make
                sure they are making full and best use — and fairly ready use
                — of the moneys available under Peace I.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to Peace II, we want to help
                people who will be genuinely caught with a gap in funding.
                Equally, we have to be aware that the European Commission
                requires Peace II to be a separate and distinctive initiative.
                Care must be taken when making assumptions about which
                programmes will continue on a roll-over basis from Peace I to
                Peace II.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A number of facts need to be considered.
                People who want to bring forward new measures, new proposals,
                new projects for Peace II have a relevant interest also. We
                cannot assume that everything funded under Peace I will
                automatically receive funding under Peace II and some comments
                being made about gap funding put us into that position. We are
                trying to be helpful to Peace I initiatives without being
                unhelpful to the other key interests that will come forward
                under Peace II.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hussey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister is aware of concerns in the
                Unionist community — they were echoed by the Deputy First
                Minister when he realised that there was a slight problem in
                applications and that perhaps a proactive approach to
                encouraging applications from the Unionist community for this
                type of funding is required. What measures are in place to
                ensure that there will be a more equitable distribution of
                funding this time?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Equality interests are represented on the new
                monitoring committees, and the Equality Commission will be
                represented on those committees. Equality considerations have
                been built into the horizontal principles that will inform the
                programmes. That includes equality of opportunity for people
                applying for funds, and making good any gaps or disparities
                there have been in uptake or access in the past. The Executive
                Committee has been determined about that, and it is an area in
                which the European Commission has been particularly encouraging.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for the directness and
                the brevity of his answer. This is one of those occasions when a
                little more detail would have been helpful. However, I accept
                fully the direct reassurance the Minister has given.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Bearing in mind that the current benefit
                office accommodation in Newry for applicants and staff is so
                poor, can the Minister indicate the timescale for finding a new
                location, where that location might be, or how it will be
                determined? Can he give us any assurance that the current staff
                complement will not be reduced in future?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member asked for more detail — he is
                now asking for quite a lot of detail. With regard to time, I
                indicated that we will invite expressions of interest from
                developers. We hope that advertisements to that effect will be
                placed in a couple of weeks. We actually want schemes to be
                submitted by 24&nbsp;January 2001 and we hope to have those
                assessed and appraised by early to mid-March. We hope to be in a
                position to make appointments then. It is estimated that it will
                take about 15 months to complete the building and occupation
                stages. I hope that work should be completed by summer 2002.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As to location, we will await proposals from
                developers. The previous site in Bridge Street is still there
                and is still available. However, developers might suggest other
                sites. The site would have to be within a mile of the town
                centre, which is taken as being the middle of Hill Street.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As far as numbers are concerned, all social
                security staff will occupy the new building. DHSS and Training
                and Employment Agency staff would also avail of the new
                building. Some of the other Departments made alternative
                arrangements since the fire, and those alternative arrangements
                will stand. Those people will not come into the new offices.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Before calling any further supplementaries,
                may I advise that I will rule Members out of order for asking
                for the replacement of offices in other places. This is not the
                first time I have had to take such a line, because Members are
                prone to give in to the temptation to take a question concerning
                a particular constituency and a specific issue and apply it
                willy-nilly to others.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I gaze around for any indication that a

                and I am sure Mr Fee appreciated it. Are there plans with regard
                to other social security offices throughout Northern Ireland,
                and is the Minister aware of the particular problems in
                Strabane?</p>

                congratulate him on his ingenuity and the Minister on the
                conciseness of his earlier reply.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker, I thank you for advising the
                Members with that very helpful moratorium. We are aware that a
                number of social security offices, and indeed a number of
                offices of different services, need to be improved, and we are
                aware that commitments have been made to a variety of
                localities, not least the one that the Member rather sneakily
                mentioned. We obviously hope to be in a position to bring
                forward appropriate details when we are ready.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Beggs:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In considering the redevelopment of benefit
                offices, will the Minister look carefully at the approach taken
                in pilot areas such as Lisburn and Dungannon, where the benefit
                offices and the Training and Employment Agency have been
                integrated? Unemployment has been reduced by 25% and this has
                been attributed to the change.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is one consideration that will be borne
                in mind when we look at future social security office
                accommodation needs. It would go along with all the other basic
                service needs of social security offices. In relation to the
                proposal for Newry, I did say that the Training and Employment
                Agency will also be located in the new office. The two
                Departments concerned — the Department for Social Development
                and the Department of Higher and Further Education, Training and
                Employment — have been successfully developing the very pilot
                schemes that the Member referred to, and the Executive Committee
                wants to see further progress made.</p>

                Development. He might well have a helpful list somewhere.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The numbers of administrative assistants
                employed on a casual basis as at 1 January in the past five
                years were as follows: 1996, 1,272; 1997, 1,584; 1998, 1,391;
                1999, 1,388; and 2000, 1,295. Casual appointments are made by
                the employing Departments to meet their business needs,
                particularly in relation to, for example, short-term vacancies,
                special projects and projected staffing levels.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to ask the Minister why so few
                permanent positions were made available. Does the Minister agree
                that it is a waste of resources to bring these people in for a
                year, train them and then let them go? The figures he quoted in
                relation to the past five years prove the need for permanent
                staff in some areas.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Again I make the point that casual
                appointments are made by the appointing Departments to take
                account of particular circumstantial pressures and needs. In
                many cases, because of vacancies at other levels, people are
                &quot;acting up&quot;, and that in turn creates temporary
                vacancies at the level of administrative assistant. That is why
                many of these appointments are temporary and casual.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While I gave the figures, as asked, for
                casual administrative assistants, perhaps I should also give
                figures for permanent appointments over part of the same period.
                During the period December 1996 to March 1998, 650 permanent
                administrative assistants and administrative officers were
                appointed. In the period April 1998 to March 1999 the figure was
                1,640, and in the period April 1999 to April 2000 it was 1,590.
                While the figures for casual appointments may seem high, a
                considerable number of permanent appointments are being made.</p>

                many have with the district rate, the regional rate and the
                rating system in general, we need to take account of what
                alternatives are available to us and what we would put in their
                place.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not believe that we can afford to opt
                for blanket abolition if we want to continue to spend at the
                sort of level we indicated in the Budget last week. If we are to
                create alternatives, we need this type of wholesale review to
                identify precisely all the issues involved, along with the
                alternatives and the possible problems that might attach to
                those alternatives.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dodds:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister will be aware of the concern
                that has been voiced about any possible increase above the rate
                of inflation in rents for Housing Executive tenants. It is an
                issue that many Members have concerns about, including those of
                us on these Benches. Can he give the House a reason why he
                proposes to increase the regional rate by 8%? When he considers
                rate revaluation for domestic properties in Northern Ireland,
                will he not reconsider this? I know that the proposed increase
                has caused concern to domestic ratepayers. The Minister has a
                little more work to do to persuade people that an increase of
                that magnitude is justified.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we compare the total rates bills of
                householders in Northern Ireland with those across the water, we
                find that contributions here are not particularly high or
                excessive, even with the 8% increase scheduled on the domestic
                rate for next year. If we take a ready reckoner on this, each
                per cent of increase on the domestic rate would work out at
                £2·2 million in terms of public expenditure. Therefore, for
                each lower rate increase of 1% that we make, we have to alter
                the spending plans for next year accordingly by £2·2 million.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If Members want to suggest alternatives for
                funding the lower rate increases, then that is something that
                could be looked at in the context of the overall Budget
                consideration. We want to try to deal with many of the
                underlying concerns and anomalies in the rating system in the
                broader rating review. We want to make it more transparent so
                that householders — the key fund-givers — actually
                understand the value of what they are contributing to and the
                value of what they are getting in return.</p>

                Department are looking at alternatives. Is it an alternative
                that this Assembly should have tax-varying powers?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Property-related taxation — the rates —
                comes within the competence of the Assembly. Tax-varying powers

                Ireland would probably appreciate no increase in the regional

                Security Bill (NIA 1/00) do now pass.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In agreeing to the provisions of this Bill,
                the House will make a major contribution to the ongoing process
                of welfare reform. I will not go over the provisions in any
                detail, but I will comment briefly on what has been achieved.
                The foundations have been laid for a new, fairer, simpler system
                of child support which, above all, will do what child support
                has always aimed to do, which is to get the money to the
                children who are entitled to it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the field of pensions, the most
                significant achievement is the introduction of the state second
                pension to help those who, through no fault of their own, cannot
                earn enough to build up a good pension under the State
                Earnings-Related Pension Scheme (SERPS) or through an
                occupational or personal pension. We are doing much to increase
                the independence in retirement of a significant section of
                society, including carers and the disabled, who until now had no
                option but to rely on means-tested benefits in their twilight
                years. We have also improved the regulation of occupational
                pension schemes by extending the functions of the Pensions
                Ombudsman and making it easier to obtain information about
                prospective pension entitlements.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The provisions dealing with housing benefit
                decisions and appeals bring that benefit into line with
                procedures for other social security benefits and child support,
                and are entirely beneficial. After a lengthy debate, we have put
                measures on the statute book to allow for both the withdrawal of
                a driving licence for failure to make child support payments and
                for the withdrawal of benefits where a court decides that a
                person has breached a community sentence.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am aware of the depth of feeling in the
                House about the severity of those measures. It is incumbent on
                me to remind the House that while those measures will be used if
                necessary, they are intended primarily as deterrents. The threat
                of a driving licence withdrawal is intended to deter
                non-resident parents from defaulting on child support payments.
                The benefits sanction is intended to encourage compliance with
                the terms of a community sentence. I remind the House that the
                provisions dealing with community sentences will not be brought
                into operation in Northern Ireland before they have been piloted
                in England and Wales. Following evaluation of the pilot schemes,
                they will both be brought into force throughout Great Britain.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to put on record my deep
                appreciation to all those who contributed to the debates on
                these sensitive matters. Many people spoke with feeling and with
                considerable knowledge, allowing us to fully consider the
                relevant issues. David&nbsp;Ford and Monica&nbsp;McWilliams
                showed particular interest, albeit in opposing certain clauses.
                There were of course those who were very positive and who
                latched on to the merits of the Bill and spoke accordingly.
                These included Peter&nbsp;Robinson, Ian&nbsp;Paisley,
                Jim&nbsp;Shannon and others.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several Members expressed reservations about
                the use of the accelerated passage procedure for a Bill of this
                size and complexity. I will not rake over the embers of earlier
                discussions about who may or may not have objected to the
                accelerated procedure had they been able to be here at the
                appropriate time. That is a side issue. The accelerated passage
                procedure is tailor-made to cover this area of legislation. The
                unique position of social security, child support and pensions
                is specifically recognised in the very Act that set up this
                Assembly and from which we draw our legislative competence.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Had we not been able to avail of accelerated
                passage, this Bill would, in all probability, have taken several
                months to complete its passage. In earlier debates I spoke at
                length about parity. I trust that all parties in the House
                recognise the major advantages that parity brings. It is clearly
                not right to delay the implementation of parity legislation for
                several months and to deny the people of Northern Ireland the
                same rights as their fellow citizens in Great Britain. Even we
                can avail of the accelerated passage procedure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The procedure is not perfect, but in the
                course of the passage of the Bill we were able to fully debate
                all the issues that Members wanted to raise. As far as I am
                aware, every Member who wished to speak was able to do so. I
                trust that I answered every question asked of me. I ask those
                Members who expressed concern about the use of accelerated
                passage to consider carefully what I have said. In conclusion, I
                thank Members for their contributions to what have been lively
                and thought-provoking debates.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It will come as no great surprise to the
                Minister that my Colleagues and I remain unpersuaded by his
                arguments, specifically on clause 16 and clauses 53 to 57. We
                found the Minister’s arguments no more persuasive than our
                friends who heard Ministers advocate similar arguments in
                Westminster did. Nonetheless, we recognise that 90% — if not
                more — of the Bill is uncontentious and contains principles of
                parity which we in this part of the Chamber fully support.
                Although we may not accept parity in every dot and comma, it is
                clear that there should be parity in the benefits paid in
                specific cases.</p>
