                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have received notice from the Minister of
                Agriculture and Rural Development that she wishes to make a
                statement on the current position in relation to foot-and-mouth
                disease.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Agriculture and Rural
                Development (Ms Rodgers):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, I apologise for the fact that I have
                only now placed my statement in the Business Office. I plead
                Standing Order 18, on the basis that there were certain things
                that I had to bring up to date in relation to serology.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am pleased to be able to report that the
                foot-and- mouth disease situation remains essentially unchanged
                since I last made a statement on the subject on 14 May. It is
                now more than six weeks since our second outbreak was confirmed,
                and there are currently no worrying suspects under investigation
                in Northern Ireland. As our thoughts turn increasingly to our
                longer-term strategy, it is absolutely vital for the farming
                community to keep its guard up.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Farmers must not fall into the trap of
                assuming that foot-and-mouth disease in Northern Ireland has
                passed into history. It is too early for that sort of
                assumption, and if the industry is to get back to normal again
                soon, it is important that the remaining controls on animal
                movements be observed to the letter. If that does not happen, we
                could find ourselves back to square one with further foot-and-
                mouth outbreaks here. Recent events in Great Britain are a sharp
                reminder that it would be disastrous for farmers to assume that
                foot-and-mouth disease has already been eradicated. I was
                delighted to hear that the Republic of Ireland is now
                recommencing exports following the outbreak. My objective is
                that we will soon be able to follow suit.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I announced last week, I reopened the
                question of regionalisation of Northern Ireland for
                foot-and-mouth disease purposes at a meeting with the
                Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection, Mr David Byrne,
                in Brussels on 22 May. He was very supportive of our case. So
                long as we have no further cases of foot-and- mouth disease, and
                so long as we have satisfactorily completed the first phase of
                our serology testing, I am confident that we will be able to
                secure full regionalisation status for Northern Ireland in early
                June.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The serology testing, which I explained in my
                last statement to the Assembly, is proceeding very well. In the
                surveillance zones, we have now met the EU’s testing
                requirements and are carrying out the final interpretation of
                the results. This has involved the blood sampling and testing of
                over 170,000 sheep from over 3,000 flocks.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Almost all the necessary Pirbright
                examinations have been carried out, with negative results. I
                await the results from three flocks to complete the serology,
                thus allowing me to seek regionalisation for Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My policy throughout the crisis has been to
                take no chances on the spread of the disease, but I have tried
                to ease controls on the movement of livestock as soon as it was
                safe to do so. Two situations continue to cause serious problems
                — the continued prohibition on the movement of sheep to common
                grazing and the continued ban on livestock marts. My chief
                veterinary officer will reconsider common grazing, and I will
                make a further announcement in the next few days. It is still
                too early to countenance reopening of livestock marts, but I
                hope that the support package announced by the Executive last
                week, which made specific provision for the marts, will go some
                way toward helping the mart owners. As with all these measures,
                I will permit the marts to reopen as soon as veterinary advice
                suggests that it is safe.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Looking further ahead, we will need a
                recovery plan for the industry, which has been battered by a
                succession of crises, not just foot-and-mouth disease. In
                Northern Ireland, the vision exercise is being revisited and
                updated to take account of foot-and-mouth disease, and it will
                give an important local dimension to any recovery strategy. The
                industry has its own ideas of what needs to be done, and my
                Department has opened discussions with its representatives.
                Industry representatives will have an input to the vision
                exercise before a preliminary report is issued in September. All
                the interested parties will be able to respond to the formal
                consultation exercise in the autumn. The outcome will be a
                package supported by the Executive. It should provide a basis
                for a more secure future for the industry in Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The UK is considering national measures to
                help those who have suffered as a result of foot-and-mouth
                disease. My officials are fully involved in that work and will
                ensure that Northern Ireland benefits from that exercise. The
                foot-and-mouth situation is resolving satisfactorily, and, as
                long as there are no last-minute setbacks, we are on target to
                achieve regionalisation and can return to normality over the
                next few weeks. That is the best outcome we could have expected,
                but it depends on the farming community’s continued vigilance
                over the next weeks and months.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for
                Agriculture and Rural Development (Mr&nbsp;Savage):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am glad that there are no more outbreaks of
                foot-and- mouth disease and that we are heading back to
                normality. We need a recovery plan, which will be welcomed by
                the farming community. I hope that everybody remains vigilant
                and helps to control the outbreak. Is there any possibility of
                an easement on lambs going to marts? That would be a sensible
                move. Instead of 30 or 40 trailers, one lorry could collect all
                the lambs at a collection point. That is vital, because lambs
                are ready, and they need to be killed or they will become too
                fat. I hope that the Minister will take that on board.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Rodgers:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am considering the provision of collection
                points at marts so that farmers will be able to deliver lambs
                there to go on to the marts.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am looking at that at the moment, and I
                hope to be able to move on it soon.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Bradley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Every time we meet, the problem seems to
                diminish. Nevertheless, caution is still the key word. Given the
                fact that outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease are still daily
                occurrences in Yorkshire, Cumbria, et cetera, and now that the
                holiday season is just around the corner, will the Minister
                detail her plans regarding precautions at our ports to deal with
                the risk of holiday traffic between GB and Northern Ireland?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Rodgers:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I can assure Mr Bradley that we will be
                keeping up our vigilance at the points of entry, which is the
                main danger zone at the moment — that and complacency. We will
                continue with the precautions that are in place, and we will
                continue to be vigilant at the ports. We ask for co-operation
                from the public and particularly for people travelling over
                here, if they have been anywhere near farms or farmland, to go
                through the spraying procedures that are available at the ports
                for them. We are also looking at marinas and other areas that
                could be a source of the infection’s entering Northern
                Ireland.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I
                welcome the fact that we are probably moving towards more
                flexibility and less risk of further outbreaks, given that there
                are continuing sporadic outbreaks in England regardless of the
                precautions that have been taken so far.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is everything well regarding antibodies in
                the sheep population at present? If so, can there be more
                flexibility in the opening of the countryside and the easing of
                controls? Is anything liable to pop out after, for instance, 7
                June?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the recovery plan, I am
                concerned that farmers are going to have to take a loss for
                animals that have passed 30 months in age. It concerns me that
                that is classed as consequential loss and is for the Public
                Accounts Committee to look after.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Rodgers:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I reiterate a word of caution. I note that Mr
                McHugh said that we now have less risk. I want to make it clear
                that I do not believe that we have less risk. There is a danger
                that the farming community might be a little complacent. There
                is still a risk, although we have so far managed to contain the
                spread of the disease.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to the antibodies, there are
                three cases from the 170,000 animals whose blood tests have been
                examined at Pirbright. We await those results, but that is only
                three out of a very large number. We have to continue the
                serology testing in all the areas outside the surveillance
                zones, and I will not rest happy until I am totally assured and
                can assure this House that we have totally eradicated any risk
                of the disease. I am not yet at that point. For that reason, I
                am very cautious every time I take a step toward relaxing the
                controls that we have had.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In fairness, the industry has, so far,
                appreciated the need to balance the risk of spread with the
                needs of the farming community. I have managed to make easements
                that have been welcomed by the farmers, particularly allowing
                the inter-farm movement that has allowed sales to take place on
                that basis.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to the recovery plan, which is
                being dealt with by the vision group, the first step is the
                opening up of our markets, which, all being well, I hope to
                achieve at the Standing Veterinary Committee in early June.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to consequential compensation, I
                think that Mr McHugh is aware that that is being looked at on a
                UK-wide basis. The Department of Finance and Personnel and the
                Executive have made an input to that, and we will certainly be
                ensuring that Northern Ireland gets its fair share of anything
                that accrues to the industry in the UK. The consequential impact
                to farmers will be looked at in exactly the same way as that for
                other people who have suffered because of foot-and-mouth
                disease. I am very anxious to be able to pay as much
                consequential compensation as possible, but we have to recognise
                the limited resources within which we work. I recognise that
                there is a real problem; the Executive have already moved in
                relation to rates relief, for the marts in particular, and we
                are still inputting to the UK consideration.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I too welcome the Minister’s statement. I
                especially welcome the fact that today she is able to make a
                relatively upbeat statement. Without wishing to detract from it,
                I am slightly surprised that she has made no mention of the
                precautionary cull of a sheep flock in south Antrim about 10
                days ago, and I wonder if she will make a statement on that.
                With regard to her comments on serology testing, is the Minister
                confident that we can make the case for regionalisation within
                Northern Ireland merely on the completion of phase one of the
                serology testing and that no further test results will be
                needed? Will she also inform the Assembly whether she has any
                proposals at this stage for the individual tagging of sheep?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to south Antrim, the Member is
                referring to a farm where I think we culled 64 sheep — I am
                not terribly sure of the number, but it was a routine cull. I
                explained some weeks ago that as we proceeded with serology
                testing there would be situations where we would be carrying out
                precautionary culls. I did not think it necessary to raise fears
                by putting everything in the public domain, although people do
                need to know that there is the possibility of a precautionary
                cull based on the results of blood tests.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On regionalisation, I have a commitment from
                Commissioner Byrne that he will support it unless there are
                further outbreaks of the disease. The Commission will, of
                course, require serology testing to have been done in the
                surveillance zones, and the surveillance zones to have been
                lifted, before that can happen.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are no proposals, as yet, on tagging,
                but we will be consulting with the industry, and we will be
                considering it because clearly there will be a need for many
                measures to be taken once we examine what has happened in recent
                months. Tagging will certainly be one of the issues that we will
                look at.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I too welcome the Minister’s statement this
                morning. The Minister has stated that she hopes that
                regionalisation can be achieved by early June. If blood sampling
                were complete, can the Minister state how long it would take to
                carry out the laboratory tests? We know that there was some
                initial difficulty in getting staff to take the samples, and I
                am led to believe there is now some difficulty in the
                laboratory. Can she give us a time frame, and can she also
                clarify how soon the restrictions in the 10-km zone might be
                lifted or eased?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department is up to speed on laboratory
                testing; we are carrying out 10,000 tests a day. That is a
                considerable amount. Additional veterinary staff are at work
                taking all the bloods, and that is also a huge undertaking. I am
                satisfied that everything possible is being done.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some of the tests have to be sent to
                Pirbright, and my Department has no control over the time that
                that process takes. I presume that Pirbright gives priority to
                suspect foot-and-mouth disease cases, rather than serology
                testing, and, therefore, it takes longer for serology test
                results to be returned.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall remove the 10-km surveillance zones
                as soon as I get the all-clear on the serology tests relating to
                those areas.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Are the three flocks for which the Minister
                is awaiting serology test results all from one area, or is there
                one flock in one area and two in another? If the three flocks
                are in one area, cannot the other area have its 10-km
                surveillance zone lifted first?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that the Stewartstown, Ardboe and
                Coagh area will be the first to have the 10-km zone lifted. That
                area is full of beef cattle, and farmers have cattle that are
                going over age and over fat. The relaxation of regulations on
                Tuesday 15 May meant that 19 cattle got to Dungannon Meats. Does
                the Minister consider that other farmers whose cattle are over
                age will be compensated in the same way as the farmers who were
                able to move cattle to Dungannon Meats? It is unfair that some
                farmers receive the full price for their cattle and others lose
                out.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Everyone is worried about the outbreak of
                foot-and- mouth disease in other areas such as Yorkshire. The
                Department and associated bodies must ensure that there is no
                relaxation of the controls on people coming into the Province.
                The Department must be diligent in its efforts to prevent the
                spread of infection.</p>

                compensation to farmers, and we have a further £1·3 million
                processed and ready to issue. The total estimated compensation

                within a few days.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to the problem of farmers not
                being able to get over-30-months old cattle out, I recognise and
                sympathise with their position. The Member said that he is not
                satisfied with my response, but he is aware that resources are a
                huge issue and that other sectors have suffered severe
                consequential loss. It would not be right for the Executive to
                differentiate between one sector and another. However, if
                resources are to become available, they will have to come from
                within the block and from other areas, which Members will have
                to consider. We will be part of the UK discussions about

                shortly, barring any further outbreaks of foot-and-mouth
                disease.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I suggest that the Member declare his
                interest before he asks his question.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Leslie:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Am I supposed to give details?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the Member is declaring an interest, he
                would be best to state it at the start rather than at the end of
                the question.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Leslie:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not sure what the answer to that is, Mr
                Speaker, because I do not believe that technically I have an
                interest. However, because I might be deemed to have an
                interest, I am simply mentioning it before someone else does.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To get to the substance of the matter, I note
                the continuing progress in the serology testing, which I welcome
                and trust will continue at the same rate, because it is
                essential to restore confidence in our livestock.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am aware that there is a delicate balancing
                act between the need to keep up precautions against the spread
                of foot-and-mouth disease and the interests of other rural
                industries, particularly in my constituency of North Antrim
                where the Glens of Antrim and the Causeway coast are significant
                tourist attractions. Tourism is probably the most important part
                of its economy. Assuming that serology testing continues at the
                current rate until the end of June with continuing satisfactory
                results, will the Minister be in a position to declare these
                areas safe for all visitors? Will she also be able to work in
                concert with the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Industry, who
                is bringing forward a package of measures to try to retrieve
                what remains of the tourist season this summer?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Rodgers:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am aware of the difficulties that have
                affected that area — and particularly the North West 200. The
                Member is aware that we have reopened the Giant’s Causeway and
                moved as far as we can on that. It is impossible for me to say
                exactly when I can relax all the regulations. The guidelines now
                state that visitors are welcome to Northern Ireland, and to the
                part of North Antrim to which the Member referred, as long as
                they stay away from farm land and farm animals. This allows a
                fair amount of leeway for people to visit various centres. The
                Giant’s Causeway is a case in point — the upper path must
                remain closed, but the lower path is open because it is not near
                farmland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I reassure the Member that I am aware of the
                efforts that Sir Reg Empey is making and of the £1&nbsp;million
                that he has allocated for the recovery of the tourist industry.
                I am anxious to facilitate that in any way providing we take
                account of the risk assessment.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I note that the Minister has already raised
                the question of regionalisation with Commissioner Byrne.
                However, is she satisfied that the British Government support
                her efforts?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Rodgers:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am satisfied that the British Government
                support my efforts to gain regionalisation. The Prime Minister
                gave me his commitment on that some weeks ago, and that still
                stands.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGrady:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In common with all Members I welcome the
                positive statement that we are moving towards normality and the
                end of this tragedy. Can the Minister reaffirm more positively
                the question asked by the Deputy Chairperson of the Agriculture
                Committee about pick-up points for animals being transferred for
                slaughter? For example, the Strangford-Down Co-operative is
                based on the concept of a gathering point. It is important, in
                terms of manpower and cost, to have collection points at marts
                or other places which can accommodate the farmers in this
                difficulty. I welcome the prospect of common grazing for sheep
                being made available in the next few days.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Speaker may rule me out of order on this,
                but I also welcome the fact that the racecourse meeting will be
                held in Downpatrick on 1 and 2 June.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member is correct — he is out of order
                on that.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGrady has already written to me about
                the Strangford-Down Co-operative. At that time I was not in a
                position to give him any consolation, but we have moved on. I
                appreciate the difficulty in bringing small numbers of lambs to
                slaughter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In reviewing that situation, I hope to
                establish collection points at the marts, which will also
                include the Strangford-Down Co-operative.</p>

                Budget timings.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Finance and Personnel (Mr
                Durkan):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With permission, Mr Speaker, I want to make a
                statement, on behalf of the Executive, on the proposed timetable
                for the Budget 2002-03.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When I presented the 2001-02 Budget to the
                Assembly on 12 December 2000, I acknowledged the concerns
                expressed by the Committee for Finance and Personnel about the
                time constraints of the exercise. I agreed that we should, in
                future cycles, ensure that the presentation of the draft Budget
                should take place as soon as possible after the summer recess.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to put on record the Executive’s
                commitment to meeting that target and to set out the proposed
                timetable for the key planning and financial events between now
                and December, when the Budget for 2002-03 needs to be agreed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This statement concerns the Executive’s
                approach to the planning of public expenditure for the year
                beginning in April 2002. The process runs from now until
                December, when we will seek to settle an agreed Budget in line
                with the Programme for Government, which will form the basis of
                spending plans for all Departments and other public sector
                bodies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some further steps will be taken on that next
                month, but they are likely to coincide with the completion of
                spending allocations for the current financial year, which began
                on 1 April 2001. The final approval of the Main Estimates and
                the related Budget (No 2) Bill will complete the process for
                2001-02, which began last autumn.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It may also help to remind Members of the
                cycle of events that lead to decisions on financial allocations.
                Those processes have their roots in the Good Friday Agreement,
                which prescribed that an annual budget should form part of, and
                be guided by the principles and priorities of, a programme for
                Government, which is an expression of the Executive’s key
                policies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For 2001-02, the Assembly’s agreement of
                the Programme for Government and the Budget that I proposed
                separately on behalf of the Executive was the culmination of
                many months of collective effort, involving determined and
                focused co-operation between the Departments, the Assembly and
                its Committees.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The production of the 2001-02 Budget was a
                first major success of our evolving institutions. It provided a
                visible and tangible demonstration of how positively and
                constructively devolution can work for the whole community. It
                was a notable achievement that we must now build on.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Central to that is the establishment of
                robust procedures to enable the Assembly to discharge its
                scrutiny role and to exercise its power to modify proposals as
                required in the Good Friday Agreement and the Northern Ireland
                Act 1998. The timetable sets out the steps that we propose to
                put in place to deliver on that commitment between now and
                December. They key dates are set out in the table attached to
                the copies of the statement, which have been distributed to
                Members.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Delivery of this Budget cycle in the
                available time, within existing procedures, is demanding. It
                will need careful management if the expectations of Members and
                Committees about consultation are to be met and if we are to
                promote equality of opportunity through those measures in line
                with the agreement and section 75 of the 1998 Act.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We sometimes face constraints because, as I
                explained in 1999 and 2000, our decisions must be developed into
                detailed allocations for many budget holders in the public
                sector. If that is to be achieved for 1 April 2002, we must have
                a clear outcome from the process before Christmas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the approach that I am setting out
                today will secure improvements to ensure that the Assembly has
                as much time as possible to consider the Budget proposals for
                the following year, in the context set by the Programme for
                Government, so that proposals can be improved in December and in
                the future after an acceptable period of scrutiny.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.15 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The vote on the Budget each December should
                be seen as the main authorisation of spending plans, and it
                follows that we should provide the best possible procedures for
                that purpose. The proposals set out in the indicative timetable
                will provide for the Assembly Committees to be involved at the
                initial stages, starting before the summer, and before the
                Executive consider a draft Budget. That process was not possible
                last year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition, there may be over two extra
                weeks this autumn, compared to the time available in 2000, for
                the Assembly to scrutinize the draft Budget. However, the
                timings are subject to change to suit the circumstances
                required. To achieve this fuller consideration the process will
                be triggered early — effectively from today’s statement.
                This will be followed by a statement on the Programme for
                Government and a pre-Budget statement in June. The statements
                should be made as soon as possible before the summer so that the
                Executive’s indications of the key issues facing the
                Administration are understood and can be the subject of debate
                in the Assembly and between Departments and Assembly Committees.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To inform this process we will provide short
                position reports in June showing the main issues affecting the
                spending plans of the Executive and the Departments. It is
                likely that these statements will coincide with Assembly
                business on the Main Estimates for 2001-02. They are two
                distinct processes, and I hope that the timing of the business
                can be managed in a way which helps that distinction. We will
                meet to debate and vote on the motion seeking approval of the
                Main Estimates for 2001-02 and then consider the Budget (No 2)
                Bill. The key point is that the Estimates concern 2001-02, while
                the Budget process set out in today’s timetable is the
                beginning of the cycle for 2002-03.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Finance and Personnel Committee will have
                an important role in collating and channelling the views of all
                Committees to me. This will apply, in particular, at the next
                phase when it can draw together the views and conclusions of
                each Committee following scrutiny of the report on their
                Department’s financial issues prepared by the Executive. I
                welcome the Committee’s advice and assistance throughout the
                process and at several key stages especially.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This consultation, which will be part of a
                wider process, should not be limited to examination of the
                information presented on Departments’ expenditure. It should
                examine implications for equality and New TSN and be informed by
                scrutiny of other material available such as departmental plans
                and the public service agreement targets set out in the
                Programme for Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Committees also need to consider how the
                priorities set out in the Programme for Government may be
                refined and developed in the light of experience in the past
                year and new developments. Many of the policy and organisational
                issues which Committees have been considering with their
                respective Departments recently will impinge on the Budget. In
                this way we can ensure effective examination and identification
                of changing financial priorities at departmental level and at a
                wider strategic level through the central role of the Finance
                and Personnel Committee. The key aim is to ensure that we can
                meet the Finance and Personnel Committee’s request for the
                draft Budget to be introduced as soon as possible after the
                summer recess. The timetable before the Assembly today will
                allow the Committee some time to consult and consider the issues
                affecting Departments. We want to achieve as much as possible
                before the recess.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Better information will be available to
                Committees and to Ministers, and that will contribute to
                consideration of the issues.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Two stages in the timetable will help to draw
                the process together. First, it would be helpful if the
                Committees could give their preliminary views for consideration
                to the Committee for Finance and Personnel by 6 July. Secondly,
                if that Committee could provide me with some views by the end of
                August, it would be possible to take them into account when the
                Executive are considering the proposals for the Programme for
                Government and the draft Budget in early September. Neither
                deadline is a guillotine on the work, as there will be scope to
                hear more from all Committees at later stages. Contributions at
                the times I have mentioned would, however, be particularly
                useful.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Between the end of August and mid-September,
                the Executive’s work will concentrate on developing and
                refining draft proposals for the Programme for Government and
                the Budget, with a view to introducing these documents in draft
                to the Assembly in late September. That would fulfil the desire
                expressed by the Committee for Finance and Personnel in its
                report last year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the draft Budget were introduced in late
                September, rather than mid-October as last year, that would
                offer more time to Committees for consultation on and
                consideration of the proposals. They will also have the benefit
                of the earlier material in the Executive’s position reports.
                Comments could be channelled through the Committee for Finance
                and Personnel. As at the stages before and during the summer, I
                shall rely on that Committee to assist by working with the other
                Committees and channelling views to me.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A further key stage of the work between 24
                September and December will be consultation on the equality
                implications of the proposals. We intend to prepare the way for
                this by making the Executive’s position reports widely
                available, so that those who wish to contribute will have
                information before the presentation of the draft Budget. During
                that period, the Assembly Committees will also consider the
                proposals for the Programme for Government and the public
                service agreements.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive will need to review the Budget
                in the autumn and decide on any revisions, depending on the
                views expressed in response to the draft Budget. Before that
                stage is reached, it should be possible to have a full debate on
                the draft Budget on foot of a motion from the Committee for
                Finance and Personnel. The Executive will thus be able to
                reflect more fully on Assembly views than was possible last
                year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to hear further from the
                Committee for Finance and Personnel on the precise sequence of
                events. As last year, however, it might be best if the Committee
                were to report to me after that Budget debate. The Executive
                could then reflect on that report in its review of the Budget,
                which will also be informed by the concurrent work on the
                Programme for Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The intention is that all the strands of work
                I have mentioned, including the views of the Committee for
                Finance and Personnel, the reaction to the equality consultation
                and the Executive’s review of these and other relevant factors
                will come together in a statement to the Assembly on the revised
                Budget in early December, leading to an Assembly debate and vote
                by 10 December.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly should note that there is no
                Treasury spending review this year. In some respects, this year’s
                work will be a transition to the spending review of 2002. That
                will see the completion of the changes to resource budgeting.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As we consider the issues in this cycle, we
                can draw on an extensive range of material which includes the
                public service agreements as set out in the Programme for
                Government, the details of the Executive programme funds and
                especially the indicative plans for 2002-03 and 2003-04 as shown
                in the Budget presented to the Assembly last December.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given the transitional nature of this year’s
                arrangements, we do not anticipate a major recasting of the
                Budget, but we will need to address some key issues; hence, the
                approach that I have described today. Some business must be done
                in June on the Estimates and the Budget (No 2) Bill for 2001-02.
                However, that is separate from the Budget process for 2002-03
                that is beginning today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There will be Programme for Government and
                pre- Budget statements in June on the main issues that must be
                addressed for 2002-03. Preliminary financial information will be
                supplied to the Committee for Finance and Personnel and other
                departmental Committees, and I shall seek the views of the
                Committee for Finance and Personnel, which will reflect the
                views of other Committees as well as its own, by the end of
                August.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Programme for Government proposals and
                the draft Budget will be considered by the Executive in early
                September and introduced to the Assembly in late September,
                after which the Committee for Finance and Personnel will take
                evidence from the Department of Finance and Personnel and other
                statutory Committees on the draft Budget. There will be
                consultation on the equality implications of the Programme for
                Government and the draft Budget, and there will be a substantive
                debate on the draft Budget in November, as part of the Committee
                for Finance and Personnel’s work to collate and channel
                comment on the Executive’s proposals. Our aim is that the
                revised Budget will be announced to the Assembly in early
                December and debated and voted on a week thereafter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that Members find the explanation of
                the intended procedures and timetable helpful as an indication
                of what is planned and that it will inform Committees’
                planning of their programmes.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Committee for Finance

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I
                welcome the Minister’s statement; it launches the Budget
                debate. I hope that all Committees will take up the debate with
                their Department.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Can the Minister assure Members that the
                statutory departmental Committees will be given adequate time to
                consider all the stages of the financial process? There was some
                slippage this year. In future, we should start the process again
                at the end of a term. Committees must be able to scrutinise the
                proposals with their own Department. That has not happened as
                early this year as we would have liked. Why has that
                consultation not happened? Were Ministers directed to consult
                their Department on the proposals?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will Committees have the opportunity to
                scrutinise the Supply resolution to ensure that it reflects each
                Department’s needs? Members should be given the opportunity
                for a debate in October. The date for the debate has moved to
                November, but the Committee has made it clear that it wants a
                debate in October, to give it enough time after the debate to
                produce a report and consult the other Committees.</p>
                <b>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I acknowledge the Committee’s input to our
                proposals on timetable and procedures.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Neither the Executive nor the Department of
                Finance and Personnel is applying time constraints. I said last
                year that Committees did not need to wait for me to fire a
                starting gun to begin consideration of their Department’s
                spending plans. I know that people have a particular interest in
                seeing which bids succeed and which fail.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, I hope that the departmental
                Committees will develop the role that they have to play in
                contributing to the thinking of Departments. Committee
                involvement should also help to ensure that Departments make
                sound plans to underpin bids. Departmental Committees can make a
                contribution towards that work, even outside the Budget cycle.</p>

                that the full debate, on a motion tabled by the Committee for
                Finance and Personnel, should take place in adequate time before
                the Committee is due to give a report to me. The precise timing
                and sequence of events needs to be resolved.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for his detailed
                statement and for the enthusiasm that he and his Colleagues have
                displayed for what is potentially a hypothetical exercise. The
                exercise provides the right template for the future, although
                the plans for the future might be delayed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Resource account budgeting is new to all of
                us. Does the Minister intend to offer a tutorial about the
                structure of the new accounts? To the best of my knowledge the
                record of assets that is held by Departments is not ready yet.
                The new accounts system will have a significant part to play in
                future planning for Departments, and I hope that it will improve
                the planning for capital expenditure. When will the figures be

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Member for his compliments. I
                believe that we will use the procedure, and I hope that we do so
                constructively. The Member’s points about the implications of
                resource accounting and budgeting are well made. One of our aims
                is to use the system to enable better planning for the
                Executive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would be happy to consider how to format
                tutorials on resource account budgeting. We could provide
                seminars on a request basis for different Committees or by
                organising parties or Committee Chairpersons. We might consult
                with the Committee for Finance and Personnel on how best to
                provide the information.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The published accounts will be available in
                October 2002. The Valuation and Lands Agency has a role in the
                ongoing work on assets. When we have further information on the
                matter we will make that available to the Committee for Finance
                and Personnel.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister’s statement. Does he
                agree that his statement is further evidence of devolution of
                power’s working? That process that we have discussed
                demonstrates the opportunity for the people of Northern Ireland
                to influence the allocation of resources through the MLAs of all
                parties. Members work closely together on Committees, although
                some people say that that is not the case. Our Committee had
                expressed some concern about the timetable, but I welcome the
                detail of the programme. We are somewhat reassured, although
                still a bit concerned, about the amount of time that is
                available. However, the system is a good step forward, and the
                template should enable progress.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the comments from the Chairperson
                of the Committee for Culture, Arts and Leisure. Through this
                timetable we have tried to give the Committees more time not
                only to consider the draft Budget, but also for input and
                reflection prior to Executive consideration. That is noticeably
                different to what happened last year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We want to ensure that through the
                Committees, MLAs can make a contribution on spending plans in
                advance. Committees should not have to wait until the draft
                Budget is available and then work in a purely reactive way.
                Committees have already done a range of work involving different
                service areas and programmes, and they have comments on those
                issues. There is no reason why those comments on spending plans
                for next year should not have been communicated to the
                individual Departments. I hope that Committees will welcome the
                greater amount of time made available to them by this timetable,
                and that they also recognise the sound material that is already
                available to them on which they can base their contributions.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have been particularly critical of the
                process over the last couple of years. However, I must give
                credit where it is due. The Minister’s statement gives us the
                opportunity and the ability to move forward in a more efficient
                manner.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As has already been mentioned, the Budget is
                the most important issue that can come before the House because
                it affects everyone in Northern Ireland. It is important that
                the procedures are right so that the right expenditure is in the
                right areas for the people we represent.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Inevitably this is a race against time, and
                it is important that we get off to a good start. Can the
                Minister assure the House that through negotiations with his
                Colleagues on the Executive, the necessary information will be
                made available to the respective departmental Committees so that
                initial comments channelled into the Finance and Personnel
                Committee by 6 July will be meaningful and constructive and will
                give us the tools to advise him correctly as Minister?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I concur with Mr Close’s comments about the
                importance of getting Budget procedures right, not only for the
                Assembly’s own conduct, but also, more importantly, for the
                good of the services to the community which this Assembly is
                responsible for providing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I reiterate that the Committees already have
                a considerable amount of relevant information for next year.
                They know where the indicative allocations lie in the revised
                Budget announced in December 2000. They have material about the
                public service agreements and the Programme for Government’s
                targets, and also the supplementary information that has since
                emerged about the Executive programme funds. The Committees have
                also been informed by their own work in exploring different
                issues.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In June the Committees will have the benefit
                of a statement on the Programme for Government that will be
                followed by a pre-Budget statement, again on behalf of the
                Executive. The Committees will receive position reports for
                their respective Departments, and the Committee for Finance and
                Personnel will receive the entire compendium of position reports
                affecting all Departments and the Executive as a whole.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committees will have that information as
                soon as it is cleared by the Executive. With this information
                the Committees will be able to give feedback to the Committee
                for Finance and Personnel before the Executive even considers a
                draft Budget, and in many cases before I, as Minister, have had
                Budget bilateral meetings with my fellow Ministers.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Part of my question has been answered, but I
                too welcome the statement from the Minister. Can the Minister
                tell us what arrangements are in place to ensure that
                departmental statements will be with Committees in time for a
                full and adequate consideration of the issues involved?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Obviously the position reports first have to
                clear the Executive. There will be an Executive meeting on 14
                June, and that is when we expect them to be agreed. The
                following week those position reports will be made available. We
                cannot do it any sooner than that, because we must ensure that
                they are first cleared by the Executive. In addition, they need
                to be in similar format, because presenting very different types
                and styles to Committees would make their job harder — and
                certainly make the job of the Committee for Finance and
                Personnel harder.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I recognise that given the date set for the
                Assembly recess it is asking Committees to engage in some
                concentrated effort to get preliminary reflections back to the
                Committee for Finance and Personnel by 6 July, but that is
                something that Committees can and should do. We always
                recognised that once we had the target of trying to introduce
                the draft Budget as soon as possible after the recess, we were
                going to have to work at some lick to get some consideration of
                it before the recess.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The needs and effectiveness reviews were
                announced to the Assembly on previous occasions, not least at
                the time of the statement on the Executive programme funds,
                which also addressed issues outstanding from the monitoring
                round. We want to use these reviews to help ensure that we are
                putting adequate resources, appropriately targeted, into the
                particular services that will be the subject of those reviews
                and inform our wider approach to negotiations with the Treasury
                on Barnett. Work is already underway on those reviews. We will
                certainly be trying to ensure that when we are doing the Budget
                work in September we will be doing some of that work in the
                light of the information coming from those reviews.</p>

                the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety to
                try to devise a system for tracking funds. Does the Minister now
                have the information that will allow his Department and the
                Health Committee to properly scrutinise the health budget?</p>

                as is work on the needs and effectiveness reviews. When the work
                is concluded the Executive will consider relevant papers from
                the Economic Policy Unit and me, and information will then be

                next year will see a spending review and we already have our
                amounts fixed for the year, there is not going to be the same
                latitude available to make significant changes. Nevertheless, if
                we use the new procedures and the more comfortable time frame
                now available, in future years when we have wider issues for
                determination we can ensure that the Assembly has as big an

              extend the methods for collecting maintenance, voluntary payments,

              of parents with care who ask to opt out of the child support
              scheme and set the time limit for their explaining their reasons.
              Of course, some parents with care have good reasons for asking to
              opt out. Each case will be considered carefully before a decision
              to reduce benefit is made. However, if we accept that parents have
              the main responsibility for supporting their children when they
              are able to do so, we cannot permit some parents to choose to pass
              on that responsibility to the taxpayer without sanction.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When a non-resident parent refuses to supply
              sufficient information for maintenance to be calculated, and the
              Child Support Agency is unable to obtain the information from
              other sources, a default rate will be set. The rate is based on
              the number of qualifying children, and it assumes an average
              income. The default rate enables liability to be set quickly, and
              it is not intended to be punitive.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Child Support (Maintenance Calculations and
              Special Cases) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2001 lay down
              detailed rules for the calculation of maintenance. There are four
              rates of maintenance to cover the particular incomes and
              circumstances of non-resident parents. The basic rate applies to
              non-resident parents whose net income is £200 a week or more. It
              is based on straightforward percentages of net income — 15% for
              one child, 20% for two children and 25% for three or more
              children. Those percentages were chosen because research shows
              that they are approximately half the proportion of income that
              most families spend on supporting their children.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The reduced rate applies to non-resident
              parents with a net weekly income of between £100 and £200. They
              will pay a lower percentage of income than the basic rate, but it
              will rise proportionately as net income increases.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A flat rate of £5 will apply to non-resident
              parents with incomes below £100 a week. Non-resident parents in
              receipt of most state benefits, pensions and allowances, including
              income support, jobseeker’s allowance and incapacity benefit,
              will also have a flat rate liability. A nil rate will apply to
              some non-resident parents, including those with incomes of less
              than £5 a week — prisoners, students, children and young people
              on income support and certain people in hospitals and residential
              homes.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The new scheme also provides for a much simpler
              definition of income, ignoring some types of income currently
              taken into account. It is very important that parents with care
              receive maintenance payments regularly and on time. Where
              non-resident parents fail to do this, the Child Support
              (Collection and Enforcement and Miscellaneous Amendments)
              Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2001 amend the current Regulations
              to allow the Child Support Agency to consider imposing a
              discretionary financial penalty.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Department has no intention of penalising
              responsible non-resident parents who have a good reason for
              failing to make a particular payment promptly, but there are those
              who, without justification, persistently involve the agency in the
              considerable extra work of pursuing late or missed payments. It is
              right that a financial penalty should be imposed on those who
              deliberately avoid paying on time.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Child Support (Information, Evidence and
              Disclosure and Maintenance Arrangements and Jurisdiction)
              (Amendment) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2001 amend the current
              Regulations on who is required to supply information to the agency
              and the purposes for which that information is needed. The agency
              will be able to ask a wider range of people and organisations for
              any information they hold that will assist in making or enforcing
              an assessment.</p>
              <i>

              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The new scheme, like the old, will allow for
              the maintenance calculation to be varied to reflect exceptional
              circumstances as set out in the Child Support (Variations)
              Regulations. Parents with care will be able to apply for a
              variation where the non-resident parent has substantial resources
              not accounted for in the calculation. Non-resident parents can
              apply if they have certain extra child-related expenses to meet.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most of the Regulations before us today will
              come into effect for different types of cases when the relevant
              sections of the Child Support, Pensions and Social Security Act
              are brought into effect. The relevant sections will be commenced
              for new cases first and, at a later date, for existing cases, once
              my Department is sure that the new systems are working properly
              for new cases.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The principles underlying the original child
              support scheme were sound, and I am convinced that the reformed
              scheme introduced in these Regulations will enable the Child
              Support Agency at last to put those principles into practice.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr ONeill:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the introduction of all of these
              Regulations. It is important to reflect on the amount of work that
              has gone into this by Department officials, the Minister and
              members of the Social Development Committee, who have examined
              these issues in considerable depth. It is also important to put on
              the record that there was concern, as the Minister mentioned,
              about the punitive nature, or the interpretation of some of these
              rules as punitive, particularly when looking at the maintenance
              calculation procedures. That issue was questioned in considerable
              depth and, when one assesses the amount of hardship that families
              suffer because of abuse and neglect by absent parents, on balance
              this is a welcome addition to the Department’s work.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The child support reforms will at last — and
              I agree totally with the Minister — put the whole area of child
              support and maintenance into a new and perhaps more workable
              system. There is no doubt that the previous one was fraught with
              great difficulty. This has been one of the better movements that
              we have seen towards improving the system, and I want to put these
              comments of support on the record.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hay:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I too welcome the Minister’s statement this
              morning, and I hope it will have an effect on parents who, for
              whatever reason, are not taking their responsibilities seriously.
              How does the Minister plan to deal with a parent who absconds to
              another jurisdiction, when the other parent is living in Northern
              Ireland and is finding it difficult raising his or her family?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Morrow:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, I welcome Mr ONeill’s comments. I know
              that he has taken a particular interest in this legislation from
              day one, and I welcome his constructive remarks here.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I reiterate that the purpose of all of these
              Regulations is to introduce a much more efficient and effective
              system and to ensure that money that should be going to children
              gets there. From Mr ONeill’s and Mr Hay’s contributions I see
              that they accept that point and see its validity.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the legislation is passed the Department
              for Social Development will be in a much better position to
              &quot;follow&quot; — and I use that word advisedly — those who
              are in default of payment. Ultimately it is the children who
              suffer. Whether those who are persistently defaulting are in this
              jurisdiction or outside it, I assure Members that every effort
              will be made to pursue them. The Department for Social Development
              will use whatever means are at its disposal to ensure that those
              people who abscond to another jurisdiction are made amenable.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members will agree that the legislation is a
              tightening-up exercise across the spectrum that can only bring
              better results than we have had before.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The purpose of the new Regulations is to
              introduce a new system of child support that will be simpler,
              fairer and above all do what child support has always aimed to do
              — get the money to the children who have a right to it. I am
              pleased that the Assembly acknowledges that, and I welcome the
              constructive remarks.</p>

              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That the Report of the Ad Hoc Committee set up
              to consider the draft clauses of the Proceeds of Crime Bill, as
              set out in Command Paper 5066, be submitted to the Secretary of
              State as a Report of the Northern Ireland Assembly.</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is a gross affront to common decency and
              democratic values that criminals can openly and fearlessly enjoy
              and display the fruits of their evil and sinister activities. It
              is hoped that through the draft Proceeds of Crime Bill they will
              soon be deprived of their accumulated wealth and that their reign
              as local crime lords will be a thing of the past.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is intolerable that any criminal should
              enjoy with impunity his ill-gotten gains. The Proceeds of Crime
              Bill will be a major blow against criminals and crime, and it
              should be welcomed by all right-thinking people. As Members will
              be aware there has been a significant rise in crime in recent
              years.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A recent newspaper report stated that the
              situation has deteriorated drastically since the 1980s. Figures in
              a recent Government report highlighted the fact that there are now
              78 gangs involving 400 individuals engaged in organised crime in
              Northern Ireland. The Government need to bring forward new
              measures to tackle these criminals. Innovative measures need to be
              used against criminals who are increasingly using highly
              sophisticated methods to profit from their illegal activities.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Over the last eight weeks the Ad Hoc Committee
              has heard evidence from a number of interested bodies: the
              Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission; the RUC; the National
              Criminal Intelligence Service; the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) in
              Dublin; Customs and Excise; and the Inland Revenue. During these
              meetings many issues were raised and discussed in great detail by
              the Committee.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The draft Bill is being taken forward centrally
              by the Home Secretary, Jack Straw, and the Committee welcomed the
              opportunity to comment on the proposals in their draft form. The
              Proceeds of Crime Bill proposes to bring together, in one Act, the
              law governing investigations, money-laundering offences and
              confiscation. In addition it will establish the Criminal Assets
              Recovery Agency (CARA), which will have both an operational and a
              strategic role. The Bill seeks to empower the agency to recover
              criminal proceeds through the use of a new form of civil
              litigation in the High Court and to exercise taxation functions
              delegated from the Inland Revenue.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The main clauses of the draft Bill have been
              arranged as follows: the criminal assets recovery agency; criminal
              confiscation; civil recovery; taxation; investigations; and money
              laundering. Central to this Bill is the establishment of the
              Criminal Assets Recovery Agency. This agency will operate at a
              national level through a director who will be appointed by the
              Home Secretary. The director must appoint a senior official to
              have responsibility for exercising the agency’s functions in
              Northern Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The agency has been modelled on the Criminal
              Assets Bureau, which has been in existence in Dublin since 1996.
              Over the past number of years it has had considerable success in
              civil recovery. To date it has recovered IR£17 million.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Ad Hoc Committee convened a very useful
              formal meeting with the Criminal Assets Bureau. Members were
              impressed by the professionalism and the dedication shown by the
              bureau staff, often in the face of personal threat from criminal
              elements. The Committee was also impressed by the Criminal Assets
              Bureau’s evident success.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee welcomed the establishment of
              such an agency to target the growing problem of criminality in our
              society. The Committee has made a number of recommendations, which
              are contained in the report. These include: the director’s being
              autonomous and consulting with the key players; objectives and
              targets being included in the agency’s annual plan; the agency
              staff’s possessing a broad range of experience; and, where
              possible, secondment’s being arranged to ensure that adequate
              use is made of the knowledge base found throughout the agencies
              that currently carry out these investigations.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.15 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The official appointed to have responsibility
              for Northern Ireland should be locally based and should rank
              sufficiently highly within the agency to be able to take decisions
              on behalf of the agency in Northern Ireland. The Committee felt
              that a deputy director post would be appropriate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proportion of the agency’s budget
              allocated for exercising its functions in Northern Ireland must be
              sufficient to allow the agency to be effective and successful.
              There must also be a clear protocol and understanding between the
              Director of Public Prosecutions — and any future director of the
              proposed new public prosecutions body — and the director of the
              new agency.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The draft Bill proposes to extend the current
              legislation for handling confiscation orders following a criminal
              conviction. It seeks to amalgamate and strengthen those powers,
              which are currently split between drugs and non-drugs Acts. The
              Committee welcomed these provisions and recommended that, in
              criminal confiscation matters, confiscation orders should only be
              made only where evidence meets the civil standard of proof.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Civil recovery is a new and imaginative
              proposal to deal with the problem of criminal assets where
              criminals have not been convicted of any criminal offence. The
              draft Bill proposes to create a new right —</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Leslie:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I apologise for interrupting, but does the
              Member not mean &quot;where persons have not been convicted of any
              criminal offence&quot;, rather than assuming that they are
              criminals?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Maginness:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Member for his intervention, which
              is entirely proper. It focuses on the fact that there are people
              who have not been convicted, but who are suspected of being
              engaged in criminality. There may not be sufficient evidence to
              bring a prosecution, or a prosecution may fail. However, there may
              be sufficient evidence to bring a civil action against such
              people.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill proposes to create a new right of
              civil recovery. That means that where it has not been possible to
              secure a criminal conviction, or it is thought that there is
              insufficient evidence to obtain such a conviction, the director of
              the agency will be able to recover or acquire the assets of a
              person where he can show to the civil standard of proof — that
              is, on the balance of probabilities — that such assets are the
              proceeds of crime.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Throughout the Committee’s proceedings, the
              question was raised as to how that impacted upon a person’s
              right to peacefully enjoy his property. Equally, many issues were
              raised relating to punishment without conviction, an area
              enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights. Following
              detailed consideration of these matters — and a comprehensive
              submission was made by the Northern Ireland Human Rights
              Commission — we are content with the opinion that a person
              cannot consider as punishment the removal of assets to which he
              was not entitled in the first instance.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the Committee’s visit to Dublin, it
              was apparent that a number of legal challenges had been made to
              the existing legislation in the Republic, which is not dissimilar
              to our draft legislation. However, the Supreme Court in the
              Republic rejected such legal challenges on the basis that human
              rights were not being infringed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I add one health warning: the Republic of
              Ireland has not yet brought the European Convention on Human
              Rights into its domestic law. Nonetheless, I am confident that
              what is proposed in the draft Bill will withstand any legal
              challenge on the basis of the European Convention on Human Rights.
              The draft Bill places some limitations on the right of recovery of
              the director; those should provide further safeguards. This part
              of the draft Bill is incomplete, and there are several issues on
              which we were unable to take a view. However, the evidence given
              by the Criminal Assets Bureau on the benefit of reaching legally
              binding agreements has convinced us that such provisions must be
              included in the draft Bill. A recommendation to that effect has
              been included in our report.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition to the right of civil recovery, the
              director will also be able to raise tax assessments as a means of
              recovering the proceeds of crime. It is envisaged that that will
              be the final route available to the director. Preference will be
              given to criminal confiscation proceedings, then to civil recovery
              proceedings and, finally, when all else fails, an individual’s
              tax assessment could be raised. The use of that method of recovery
              by the Criminal Assets Bureau in Dublin has proven very effective.
              Figures provided by the bureau show that raising assessments has
              produced IR£33 million in the first four years of operation —
              an impressive figure. We welcome the inclusion of the provisions.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The draft Bill makes provision for three new
              powers to assist investigations into the whereabouts of the
              proceeds of crime. In addition to the production orders and search
              warrants already provided for under existing legislation, the
              draft Bill introduces disclosure orders. The power will be
              available only to the director of the new agency, who will be able
              to require a person to answer questions at interview, to provide
              information or produce documentation. An order can be issued
              against a person whose assets are under investigation or against a
              third party. Secondly, customer information orders will require
              banks and other financial institutions to provide the details of
              any accounts held by a person under investigation. Thirdly,
              account monitoring orders will require a bank or other financial
              institution to provide transaction information on a suspect
              account.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second and third orders will be used
              collectively, one to identify the suspect accounts and the other
              to monitor those accounts. All five powers will be exercised under
              judicial authority. The draft Bill also seeks to amalgamate the
              current legislation and to remove the absurd distinction between
              drugs and non-drugs offences. We welcome the introduction of the
              new powers and the removal of that distinction.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The draft Bill will reform the definition of
              the criminal offence of money laundering, and it will remove the
              distinction between drugs and non-drugs offences in this regard.
              The draft Bill will also extend the financial institutions’ duty
              to report suspicious transactions to the relevant authorities. We
              welcome those provisions.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill will go a long way towards tackling
              the criminality that afflicts society. It will restore the
              confidence of the general public in the due process of law.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Ad Hoc Committee endorses the draft Bill,
              which will provide the opportunity, through a multiagency
              approach, to recover the proceeds of crime from an ever more
              sophisticated group of criminals. Those criminals will no longer
              be able to act with impunity. Society in general will welcome any
              new legislation that tackles this serious problem and ends the
              scandal of criminals publicly flaunting their wealth and making a
              very frightening statement to society — that is, that crime
              actually does pay.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I submit the report to the Assembly and invite
              Members to give it their full endorsement. I support the motion.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy Chairperson of the Ad Hoc Committee
              (Sir John Gorman):</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am grateful for the opportunity to say
              something on this matter — my own background includes law
              enforcement.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the Committee visited Dublin, the
              Chairperson behaved with great perspicacity and dignity and
              impressed our hosts. I was struck, on that visit, by the
              co-operation of the various arms of Government. The gardaí, the
              Attorney General, Customs &amp; Excise, the Inland Revenue and
              social services combined in a joint action in the interests of the
              public, keeping down crime and ensuring that criminals were not
              profiting from the community.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We might find that some arms of our Government
              are less communautaire in how they approach this problem. I hope
              that, as a consequence of Mr Straw’s intentions and of the
              recommendation of this Ad Hoc Committee, we might see that sort of
              liaison, particularly in the intelligence field, which is
              particularly inspiring and aiding the Criminal Assets Bureau in
              the other part of the island.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that, whatever may happen to other
              relationships, the Government of the Irish Republic and the
              Northern Ireland Assembly will collaborate fully in ensuring that
              both parts of this island work together in the accordance that we
              saw in Dublin. I am confident that this will be a most flourishing
              and useful activity in minimising the drug problem, and the money
              that goes into that. It will also help to combat the other
              difficulties with criminality and dishonesty that gain so much
              kudos and revenue for so many people in this country — not least
              in the paramilitary field. I support the Bill.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Kane:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the draft legislation. It will be a
              great asset in bringing the criminal to task. A large number of
              individuals have led a very affluent lifestyle and are wealthy
              people who have lived off the community for 30 years. The entire
              community has suffered because of their bad deeds and will
              undoubtedly welcome the draft legislation. I commend the draft
              Bill to the House.</p>
              <b>

              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.30 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also welcome the fact that consultation took
              place when the Bill was in draft form. Some witnesses who gave
              evidence to the Committee stated that that procedure should be
              followed for other pieces of legislation, allowing the public an
              opportunity to contribute its views at an early stage, prior to
              legislation’s coming to Parliament. However, some sections of
              the draft Bill, relating to the North of Ireland, are incomplete.
              Therefore, the Committee’s report on the draft Bill can only be
              provisional upon the completion of the Bill.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission
              expressed concerns about the compatibility of the Bill with the
              European Convention on Human Rights. Legislation introduced in the
              United Kingdom should comply with the Convention. If the Bill is
              in contravention of the Convention, the human rights of the
              individual may not be protected for the purposes of the
              legislation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We also have to consider the legal consequences
              of non-compliance of the Bill with the Convention. I support the
              concept that those who have acquired the proceeds of crime should
              be prevented from enjoying them. However, if the final Bill does
              not comply with the European Convention on Human Rights, it is
              open to challenge. If the Bill is not compliant and is
              successfully challenged in the European court, the whole purpose
              of the Bill will be undermined. Our report should deal with the
              issues raised.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Madam Deputy Speaker [Ms Morrice] in the
              Chair)</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As usual, the Chairman gave a broad
              introduction to the work of the Committee, and he referred to the
              Criminal Assets Bureau in Dublin. However, the European Convention
              on Human Rights has not yet been incorporated into the domestic
              law of that part of Ireland. Therefore the legislation in the
              South may be open to challenge. However, members of the Criminal
              Assets Bureau were confident that they could deal with any such
              challenge, given their operation and how they employ the
              legislation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Potential for the final Bill to be in
              contravention of the European Convention on Human Rights resides
              in assumptions which, under the draft provisions, are to be made
              when civil recovery is employed. The Criminal Assets Bureau felt
              that the definition of a person’s having a criminal lifestyle
              was somewhat woolly.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Under European legislation, civil recovery
              could be viewed as a criminal proceeding. Therefore the Bill has
              the potential to contravene article 6 paragraph 2, articles 7 and
              8 of the Convention, and article 1 of protocol 1 to the
              Convention. Due regard must be given to those comments to ensure
              that the final Bill is compliant with European legislation and
              that it can succeed in the purpose for which it was intended. Sir
              John Gorman referred to our enlightening and educational meeting
              with the Criminal Assets Bureau in Dublin.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The innovative interagency approach of the
              bureau was clearly seen. It is made up of people from the Garda
              Síochána, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, the
              Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, customs
              officials and others with professional expertise in law,
              accountancy and information technology. Those people remain in the
              employment of their respective bodies while working with the other
              elements of the Criminal Assets Bureau to pursue the recovery of
              the proceeds of crime and to assist in the investigation of the
              proceeds of crime. There are many lessons to be learned, and
              countries throughout the world are looking at the establishment
              and operation of the Criminal Assets Bureau.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Criminal Assets Bureau has been successful
              in the recovery of the proceeds of crime and in relation to the
              taxation of those who have benefited from such proceeds. More
              importantly, the bureau has been successful because of the public’s
              perception of it and the public’s confidence in its operation.
              The public is satisfied that the bureau does what it is required
              to do. The success of the Criminal Assets Recovery Agency (CARA),
              which will be established under the Bill, will depend on public
              perception. It will depend on public confidence in the various
              bodies that will form part of the agency and in the future police
              service in this part of Ireland. Interestingly enough, &quot;cara&quot;
              is the Irish word for &quot;friend&quot;, but CARA will not be the
              friend of a number of people.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It would be useful for the public to be aware
              of one item of evidence that was given to us. Det Supt Thompson of
              the RUC gave evidence to the Ad Hoc Committee, and he was
              questioned fairly thoroughly on the need for a Bill and an agency
              such as CARA. He was asked about the scale of criminal assets and
              their nature in this part of Ireland compared to those in other
              places. Det Supt Thompson said that, in relation to the possible
              origins of assets and property, the RUC would benefit from this
              legislation in the pursuit of approximately 180 identifiable
              people.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Det Supt Thompson was also asked whether those
              180 people would be believed by the RUC to be from paramilitary
              organisations, other organisations, or working as individuals.
              Interestingly, he said that the majority of people whom the RUC
              would be interested in pursuing for the purpose of denying them
              the proceeds of crime were individuals who were working on their
              own behalf. It is also interesting that the scale of criminality
              and the extent of the proceeds of crime in this part of Ireland
              are much less significant than those in many other parts of the
              United Kingdom.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We can take some comfort from that. We often
              hear about the enormous scale of criminality and racketeering in
              the North, so it was some relief to hear that it is not as bad as
              people make out.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the report, even though essential
              parts of it have yet to be drafted.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Close:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In many respects, the proposed Bill builds on
              and adds to the report of another Ad Hoc Committee — the one set
              up to look into the draft Financial Investigations (Northern
              Ireland) Order 2001. Its aims are rather similar, and its targets
              are the same. We are aiming to curb the lifestyle of those who are
              financed by illegal, illegitimate and ill-gotten gains. The aim of
              the Proceeds of Crime Bill, as with the 2001 Order, is to hit
              those individuals in their pockets, where it hurts.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Society needs the necessary legal frameworks to
              deny these parasites the trappings of their ill-gotten gains and
              sordid deals. The Assembly must be seen to be making real progress
              in cleaning up society.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Member agree that to continue his
              principle and logic, extending the trappings of Government to
              certain criminals is also unfair and that the logic that he has
              rightly applied to this legislation should apply to Government and
              should, therefore, exclude Sinn Féin/IRA from it?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Close:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is one huge difference between what the
              Member says and reality. Not for the first time, the Member who
              has just spoken is somewhat removed from reality. The reality is
              that those who are in the Government of Northern Ireland, by way
              of positions in the Executive, are there by the express will and
              desire of the people of Northern Ireland. That is democracy. The
              Member, and a number of other Members, may not like it, but the
              will and the voice of the people must always be supreme.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Democracy does not enter the equation when we
              are dealing with criminals and those who have milked society
              through their criminal activity. Criminals want to deny democracy.
              I want to see society cleared of those people who benefit from
              ill-gotten gains. Society wants to see the drug barons who profit
              from the addiction of helpless individuals stripped of their
              illegal gains. Society wants to see a cracking-down on the money
              launderers, the fuel cheats and the tobacco fraudsters. They must
              be made amenable and accountable for their tax evasion, ill-gotten
              fat bank accounts, foreign holidays, flashy cars and large houses
              in Northern Ireland and on the Continent.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Over the years, criminals — and what I would
              refer to as the &quot;smart alec&quot; — have become more
              sophisticated. Their methods have become more subtle. It is to be
              regretted that those who are charged with the responsibility of
              cleaning up society and trying to make these individuals amenable
              to the law have been losing the battle to a large degree. That is
              why those who are intent on crimes such as drug smuggling see it
              as relatively easy pickings.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proposed Bill goes some way towards
              redressing the imbalance that is currently in vogue. It is
              important that innovative thinking be given its head and that new
              measures be taken and supported by society to help to clean it up.
              In that respect, I particularly welcome the views of the Human
              Rights Commission. It is supportive of the measures and
              suggestions that are being put forward.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill will establish a Criminal Assets
              Recovery Agency which will be able to pursue criminal assets in
              several ways: the confiscation of assets of convicted criminals;
              the recovery of assets through civil proceedings; and the taxation
              of persons suspected of having benefited from criminal activity.
              Such a joined-up approach, which the Chairperson and Deputy
              Chairperson of the Committee have already referred to, is vitally
              important. I endorse the comments of those who referred to our
              visit to the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) in the South of Ireland.
              If you ever needed proof of the success of the CAB you have only
              to look at the figures. The CAB in the South recognises that crime
              knows no barriers and cuts across all facets of society, and its
              impressive figures make it patently clear that there is a need for
              a joined-up approach.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we are going to make a real impact in
              Northern Ireland on the task confronting the Criminal Assets
              Recovery Agency, adequate resources must be made available. We
              touch upon these issues in the report’s recommendations.
              However, it is essential that the message reaches the Secretary of
              State, and through him, the Home Secretary, that Northern Ireland
              requires the resources to ensure that criminal activity is nipped
              in the bud and is not given the opportunity to become a
              many-headed monster. The resources must be made available from day
              one. The person who is put in charge of the agency in Northern
              Ireland must be of assistant director status at least and be fully
              acquainted with Northern Ireland, its people and its
              organisations. I advocate that the person should be from, and have
              his roots in, Northern Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When we took evidence from the police, they
              pointed out that the effects of drug trafficking and acquisitive
              crime that is of a highly profitable nature should not be
              underestimated, and I endorse that view. The impact of such crimes
              on society, business and individual victims, particularly where
              organised criminality is involved, has been widely publicised.
              There is no good argument for allowing individuals to profit from
              their illegal activities, and it is right that criminals should
              have their ill-gotten gains taken away. I hope that the House and
              society will say &quot;Hear, hear&quot; to those comments.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The police also said that it is estimated that
              180 people in Northern Ireland have substantial assets from
              criminal activity. The House must call for those people to be put
              out of business.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">HM Customs and Excise calculate lost revenue
              in, for example, oil fraud to be around £100 million in 1998.
              Many people, particularly legitimate petrol retailers who have
              been put out of business throughout Northern Ireland, would say
              that that figure is only the tip of the iceberg. New powers are
              needed to deal with such illegality. The Northern Ireland economy
              is suffering from a massive haemorrhage because of criminal
              activity. It is incumbent upon all of us to make sure that the
              necessary steps are taken and the necessary laws put in place to
              stop the haemorrhaging.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I endorse the report and congratulate the
              Chairperson, the Committee members and particularly the staff of
              the Committee for the excellent work that they did preparing the
              report in the relatively short time that was available.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ervine:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I concur with Mr Close’s comments about the
              Chairman, the Committee members and especially the Committee
              staff. This is a sterling piece of work, and when the legislation
              eventually comes into effect, it will change our lives –
              although you would not guess that by the numbers in the Chamber
              today. It will be a turning point in Northern Ireland. This
              legislation will allow us to be proactive in the battle against
              crime and believe that we can win when we continue a battle that
              we have been fighting with our hands tied behind our backs.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our fear is that, when legislation is created,
              people will either not understand it or feel that they are not
              affected by it. This piece of legislation will most definitely be
              understood by those who are watching many of the 180 people
              previously mentioned as masquerading as legitimate businesspeople.
              Very often they live in middle-class areas and appear to be
              respectable. Others live in small working-class housing estates,
              and their wealth can be seen, although their neighbours may not
              realise that some of the oil paintings are so valuable that they
              are part of money laundering.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As well as removing assets from those people
              who have benefited shamefully from crime, the Criminal Assets
              Recovery Agency will have to deal with those who have assisted
              them. Legitimate businesspeople, or people who perceive themselves
              as such, who assist in the laundering of money, should desist,
              because under this legislation, they will be caught. I have
              absolutely no doubt of that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not merely pleased with the Bill, I am
              frankly delighted with it. It will change the whole atmosphere.
              Ordinary people who live literally yards from me have been
              watching what goes on around them and asking &quot;Why can
              somebody not do something about this?&quot;. The sterling work
              carried out by the police and other members of the security
              services has not been enough to stem the tide of crime. It will be
              evident quite soon that it is not simply the diligence of
              individual officers that is important; rather it is the tools with
              which they have to work. The potential tools in this legislation
              are quite wonderful and will benefit the security services
              immensely.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have heard from those who have visited the
              Criminal Assets Bureau in Dublin that the degree of public
              confidence there increased massively when people saw how the
              bureau goes about its business. Is that not something that we need
              here? Do we not need to know that someone will protect us and do
              something to those bad people who are polluting our children?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I commend the police and the Human Rights
              Commission for their evidence. The police identified approximately
              180 people who are, I suppose, quite different in type. There is
              the gangster who would be a gangster regardless of where he came
              from. Then there are others who have seen the capacity to make
              easy money without any constraint. Perhaps there are members of
              paramilitary organisations who follow the path of benefiting
              themselves rather than the society that they say they serve. I
              have watched these people grow and amass a wealth that brings with
              it power. Today I delight in the fact that that wealth and power
              have become their Achilles heel.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is the very way in which we will identify
              them; it is the very way in which society already identifies them;
              and it is the very way in which CARA will put them behind bars —
              or at least, I hope, remove their assets.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We learned about the situation in South Africa,
              where the security services felt that their hands were tied. They
              could arrest the criminal, but the criminal accepted that
              consequence to be how life is. They took the attitude that because
              they live such a life, they might get caught, they would go to
              jail, and then they would get out. As the story goes, they
              accepted their arrest and imprisonment in a very macho way.
              However, when their assets were seized — their houses, cars, and
              their capacity to send their children to private schools — when
              this all came tumbling down around their ears they cried in the
              dock. There is significance in that story for those who perpetrate
              ills on this society.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will go further and say that patriotism is
              very often the last refuge of a scoundrel. We have watched the old
              war movies in which there was always a black marketeer. We have
              seen circumstances in which those in positions of privilege or
              importance have abused their position. There are paramilitarists
              in Northern Ireland — I am not sure that we should ever refer to
              them as Loyalists or, indeed, Republicans — who are a blight on
              this society. Some will argue that all paramilitarists are a
              blight on this society — they will say that publicly, but not
              necessarily in private. However, at what point does society
              recognise someone to be a chancer, or, as my Colleague described
              it, a &quot;smart alec&quot;? By this I mean those who say that
              they are one thing, but who are really involved in it to seek all
              they can get for themselves.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members, and many people outside this Chamber,
              can identify those smart alecs in seconds, in their own areas and
              communities. There is no longer an excuse for the authorities’
              failure to identify them also and to follow this problem through
              to its logical conclusion by stripping from these people the
              single thing that allows them to ply their trade in my community
              — the suggestion that they function on behalf of the community.
              This proposed legislation would create the circumstances by which
              those people will cease to be a blight on us.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The American Government with its helicopter
              gunships cannot stop people from taking drugs. They will try, as
              will other Governments, to make it more difficult for the
              criminals involved. That is what I advocate that we do, and the
              United Kingdom Government, through this legislation, will
              undoubtedly make things logistically difficult.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, what is really needed to deal with the
              issue of drugs, which is only one element dealt with in this Bill,
              is an education programme to involve people in what is happening
              in their lives. We need to inform adults, or those who are not au
              fait with the drug culture, of what is happening to their
              children, and what the effects of this will be. This will be not
              only about legislation. Society will have to do a great deal, and
              I look forward to the introduction of the legislation which will
              help us deal with it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Oil and cigarette smuggling are detrimental to
              the Exchequer, and potentially, they give criminals money with
              which to do bad things. However, my fear is that the Chancellor,
              Gordon Brown, will be more concerned with stopping the loss of
              revenue on fuel and cigarettes, rather than ensuring that CARA
              gets the full resources to destroy those who take life through
              drugs. My fear is that political direction will be CARA’s one
              Achilles heel. Three Colleagues have already identified the
              importance of an independent director for CARA — one who is
              based in Northern Ireland and who preferably has an experience and
              understanding of the people here. This would create a genuine
              independence. The director of CARA would determine the direction
              in which that organisation would move, and political direction
              based on concerns about loss of revenue would not be the issue.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the director of CARA had to measure the loss
              of revenue against children’s deaths, the pollution of our
              society, the massive increase in heroin use and the lives lost
              through heroin in north Antrim, it would become simple. And where
              there is one heroin addict, there is one dealer, then two, then
              three, and so on. There are 59,000 people in the Ballymena borough
              and hundreds of heroin addicts. Middle-class people, however,
              cover up the problem because of their sense of shame and hurt, so
              we do not have a clear picture of what is happening in the area.
              Our choice has to be the destruction of those who destroy other
              people’s lives.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.00 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will, no doubt, be accused of hypocrisy, but
              it is important that the power and authority, skill and ability
              that will undoubtedly be pulled together to create CARA be
              directed towards the destruction of those who pollute society and
              cause unbearable pain. We may not be as bad as other places yet,
              but we should take the proposals on board. I commend the work of
              the Committee and the report.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Leslie:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am pleased that we are debating these
              important measures. I had feared that the issue would not receive
              due attention. This is an important piece of legislation, which
              may be enforced in Northern Ireland before the rest of the United
              Kingdom, given that it can go through as an Order in Council
              because it is a reserved matter. However, there are certain
              drawbacks in being a guinea pig, and it may be in a less refined
              form when it becomes operable here. Nevertheless, for the reasons
              that Mr Ervine has outlined, Northern Ireland society will be
              pleased to see it in force.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have a slight caveat, however, I acknowledge
              that the structure of the law needs to be adjusted in accordance
              with the changing nature of crime. We are forced to adopt our own
              systems to combat the power of those who are able to subvert the
              system of justice and acquire huge assets by unlawful means.
              However, should this legislation hit the wrong target, the
              affected person would be able to show that the legislation was
              repressive. That may be true, but it is necessary in the
              circumstances. The Bill should be introduced as emergency
              legislation, perhaps for an initial period of three to five years
              and then renewed by Parliament at two-yearly intervals, so that
              Parliament has to examine the legislation continuously and be
              aware of how it is working. Having taken the decision to introduce
              legislation of this kind, Parliament must be robust and ensure
              that it works in the way that Members have described this morning.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I noted with concern the comments made by the
              Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission about a potential clash
              with that legislation. I note that the Committee has said that
              depriving someone of assets to which he was not entitled does not
              constitute a punishment. I also note that the Human Rights
              Commission said that Parliament could expressly decide that it
              wanted to proceed in a way that was incompatible with the European
              Convention on Human Rights. Even if Parliament did so proceed, a
              successful challenge could be mounted through the European Court
              of Human Rights.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I imagine that Parliament would not wish to
              proceed in such a manner, as that would be conceding the point. It
              would probably prefer to let the point emerge — if it were going
              to emerge — when someone took a case. There is a potential
              difficulty there, but I trust that, if it should reach that stage,
              the European Court would prove to be robust, although that again
              raises the issue of why Her Majesty’s Government put Parliament
              in the position of being subject to a higher authority in Europe.
              It is quite extraordinary, and the consequences of that decision
              will have a greater and more frequent impact on us.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ervine:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member may not be aware of it, but 43
              countries are attempting to create — or have created — similar
              legislation. That adds to our capacity to control the problem, not
              only in our country but beyond our borders. In this instance,
              belonging to Europe will not be at all detrimental.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Leslie:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was not aware of that fact; it is a source of
              some comfort. In its submission, the RUC said that it was vital
              that sufficient human resources be made available to allow CARA to
              operate effectively. A considerable amount of cash will be needed.
              If one plans to mount a series of High Court actions, one must be
              sure that there are sufficient resources to do so to the best of
              one’s ability, employing the best legal counsel. A figure of
              £54 million for the UK for three years has been identified as the
              funding that would be made available to CARA. I am unable to judge
              whether that is a lot or a little. It sounds like a large amount,
              but it could diminish quickly. I endorse Mr Ervine’s view that
              there must be sufficient assets to do the job. A regular review by
              Parliament of the progress made under the Bill would help to
              highlight that issue, among others.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is £54 million a net figure? If CARA is
              successful in recovering assets acquired through criminal
              activity, there will be proceeds. What will happen to those
              proceeds? Will they be absorbed into the funding of the agency?
              That might be a reasonable thing to do, and it would have the
              highly satisfactory effect that people found by the High Court to
              have acquired assets illegally would be financing their further
              prosecution. Were the agency to be so successful as to recover
              hundreds of millions of pounds, what would be done with that
              money? Again, I echo Mr Ervine’s concerns; I would like to see
              the money being used to ensure that CARA is properly funded and
              returned to the part of society that lost it in the first place.
              Again, that would greatly add to the public’s satisfaction with
              this legislation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I note that there is to be a memorandum of
              understanding involving the director of CARA, the Chief Constable
              of the RUC and the Director of Public Prosecutions, and I wonder
              whether some sort of protocol should also be in place with the
              other agencies that have been mentioned. It would be most
              unfortunate if we were to find a turf war going on. There must be
              some risk that that might be the case, although I have noted the
              comments of my Colleague, Sir John Gorman, about the high degree
              of co-operation that seems to have been achieved in Dublin. It
              would be most unfortunate if, instead of the Inland Revenue’s
              being an instrument of CARA, it were to appear that CARA had
              become an instrument of the Inland Revenue. That would work
              heavily against the effectiveness of the operation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I suspect that it is better to keep the
              definition of criminal lifestyle rather woolly and to give the
              courts the discretion to interpret it, although you run the risk
              that the courts will start off with a narrow interpretation that
              will become a precedent. I hope that Parliament will address that
              matter in some detail and work out whether it would be better to
              try to define the term without running the risk of a narrow
              definition allowing a more imaginative criminal to work outside
              its scope.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was noted in the report that the sorts of
              people with whom we are dealing are exceedingly entrepreneurial in
              their activities, and we must be aware that the nature of the
              crime can continue to develop. We should bear in mind an
              outstanding early example of proceeding tangentially — Al Capone
              was not put in prison for smuggling alcohol but for income tax
              evasion.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, I note that the Bill proposes to limit
              the director of CARA’s activities in a number of ways, one of
              which is to say that he will have a claim on actual criminal
              proceeds but not the respondent’s other property. If the money
              has been efficiently laundered it would be very hard to identify
              what was what. The section on money laundering simply set out to
              make it easier to establish the offence of money laundering.
              Parliament needs to be careful about the restrictions on the
              claims that can be made by the director, so as to ensure that a
              highly entrepreneurial manipulator of criminally- acquired assets
              does not manage to evade the rules that have been put in place.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In conclusion, the director of CARA will have a
              key and very responsible role, and I imagine that there might be a
              number of people from Northern Ireland recently retired from a
              career in law enforcement who might be very suitable candidates
              for that job for the whole of the United Kingdom.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr O’Connor:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome this report. I had the privilege of
              deputising for Mr Attwood at a Committee meeting in Dublin. It
              opened my eyes and gave me hope when I saw that these people can
              be taken down a peg or two. The people who are purveying death to
              the children of Northern Ireland can be brought down because you
              hit them where it really hurts — in their hip pockets.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.15 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I believe that, as Mr Leslie said, we have to
              find a high-water mark and a low-water mark in order to know the
              bounds of what can and cannot be done. In the context of the
              European human rights legislation excerpted in Annex A of the
              report, this is not a punishment. It is a recovery of assets that
              they should not have had in the first place.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In protocol 1, article 1, paragraph 1 of the
              European Convention on Human Rights, the phrase &quot;except in
              the public interest&quot; is used. No one could deny that this is
              in the public interest. Article 8 of the Convention protects the
              right to respect for private and family life. Paragraph 2 of
              article 8 makes an exception &quot;for the prevention of disorder
              or crime&quot;. Paragraph 2 of article 1 of protocol 1 provides
              another exception &quot;to secure the payment of taxes or other
              contributions or penalties&quot;. These things are present in
              human rights legislation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Human rights legislation protects the rights of
              human beings as a whole. It is not there to protect a guy sitting
              in a £200,000 house, with a BMW at his front door, his children
              riding about on new mountain bicycles, while he is going to claim
              his dole money every other Thursday. That is a total perversion of
              society. It is an insult to those people who are on the dole and
              who need that money to live.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Here we have people lording it over council
              estates, sending out the wrong message to the children of this
              country that if they become involved in crime, they do not need an
              education or a job, because they can live like these people by
              selling drugs to young people. That is not the message that I want
              to send to the children of this country. The message that I want
              sent out is that there will be no hiding place for the drug
              barons; there will be no hiding place for anyone involved in
              illegal activities such as fake CDs, Playstation games, et cetera.
              Those are all things which are helping to create their financial
              empires.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Drugs is the lethal one. As Mr David Ervine
              said, people are dying in this country because of drugs. We have
              those people sitting in their £200,000 houses like the centre of
              an onion, with so many skins that you cannot get near them. We
              need to shift the burden of proof. Those people can intimidate
              witnesses. They can pervert the entire criminal justice system
              through their intimidation, because their tentacles are so long
              and so far-reaching. The burden of proof must be shifted, and that
              is what this Bill does. If you are legit, where did you get the
              money? No one should have any difficulty in explaining how they
              came by their house or car, if it were by honourable and decent
              means. This Bill is aimed at those who gain by dishonest means.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not accept that we would hit the wrong
              target. If the burden of proof were shifted, then the person would
              be given the opportunity to say that he has gained his possessions
              legitimately and to show his receipts, accounts and tax returns.
              This problem will not go away with emergency legislation: it will
              change and develop, and we have to adapt accordingly.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, I do not think that emergency
              legislation is necessarily the way to go about it. We are trying
              to move into a normal society, and we want to move away from
              repressive emergency legislation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We want a multi-elemented approach to this. Sir
              John Gorman mentioned that the Garda Síochána has a role to
              play. There are revenue inspectors who can trace money through
              financial transactions and tax it at 24% per annum for tax that
              has not been paid. There are the social welfare agencies that
              recover money paid out in unemployment and social welfare benefits
              that should not have been paid, and Customs and Excise, which can
              recover VAT and other such duties.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Leslie talked about Al Capone’s being
              taken down for tax evasion. Perhaps what we need now in this
              country is a team of &quot;Untouchables&quot;, and our very own
              Elliott Ness to lead them, but this is a welcome start. The only
              reservation I have is that there is no hearsay element to it.
              There are times when it may be necessary for the director of such
              an agency to apply before a High Court judge on the basis of
              intelligence in his possession to ensure that certain assets can
              be seized. It may be to protect certain people, or to protect
              operations that are ongoing against other criminals. I wanted to
              see that element included.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This cannot be measured in terms of money. We
              may be able to say that we can recover £10 million this year.
              However, the real benefit of this is that it sends out a message
              to the people of Northern Ireland that these persons are going to
              be taken down, that crime does not pay. Young people in particular
              should stay away from that path, because they will be taken down
              and taken down hard.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hay:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Ad Hoc Committee has done an important
              piece of work. Right across Northern Ireland, there will be many
              law-abiding citizens who will welcome what has been brought
              forward to the Assembly. The Committee and the Chairperson should
              be congratulated. I am sure that we will all get another
              opportunity to discuss this further as it goes forward.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Across the community in Northern Ireland, and
              further afield, we have watched these people operate so well that
              some of them try to tell us that crime pays. There is a notion in
              Northern Ireland that crime pays. We see gangsters with their
              lavish houses, big cars and with three or four holidays a year.
              All of that has been done at the expense of the entire community.
              That is the tragedy. It is the community that pays for the crimes
              committed in Northern Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For this to work effectively, there has to be
              co-operation between agencies. There has to be co-operation across
              the border. There can be no one in this House who believes that
              criminals operating in Northern Ireland stop at the border. We all
              know that that is not the case. Many of these people are also
              operating in the South of Ireland, some of them very successfully.
              There is no doubt about that. I certainly welcome the co-operation
              of the Southern authorities in this matter, because that is very
              important.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are criminals in Northern Ireland who
              believe that they can abscond to a different jurisdiction and
              still pick up the pieces and carry on their crime. There is also a
              belief among some criminals — a belief that will soon be gone
              — that if they do a few years in jail, they will always come out
              to their assets. Jail is not a deterrent to them, because when
              they get out they are free to carry on doing what they were doing
              before. Some of their activities go beyond anybody’s idea of
              decency. They are into every shameful crime in Northern Ireland.
              They do not stop at drugs — there are even more sinister crimes
              across the country.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For years some people thought that they were
              above the law. Some of them — for instance, in my constituency
              of Foyle — boasted of their activities and their lifestyles and
              about still being able to sign on and receive benefits. They
              freely told people about operating in that way and wondered why
              everyone else seemed to work so hard for such a small living when
              they could live such lavish lifestyles. For many years — and
              some Members referred to this — it sent out all the wrong
              messages to young people, although not to all of them, since the
              vast majority of young people are decent.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A small number of young people have been lead
              into crime because they saw those lavish lives and how easy it was
              to get a few pounds. Those people never had any problem getting
              money. Many young people saw this and were lead into crime, and
              that is a tragedy.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no doubt that many people involved in
              crime were able to hide behind the 30 years of the troubles. Some
              of them used the troubles by, for example, saying to people that
              they were fighting for a cause, irrespective of which side they
              came from. Some of them were able to justify to their own people
              that what they were doing was for the cause. Now that the level of
              the troubles has lowered, some of these people are very exposed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ordinary decent people from both sides are now
              asking whether there ever was a cause. Where was their loyalty?
              Their loyalty was to themselves and to their activities. The
              tragedy is that they bled both communities for many years.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that what the Chairperson of the
              Committee has said and this important piece of work will bring to
              an end these types of activities.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some of those who are indirectly attached to
              the criminals, and who work on the sidelines, are well known. I
              hope, when the Assembly is debating the Proceeds of Crime Bill,
              that Members will ensure that the relevant agencies and
              authorities are given the teeth to deal with the problem — that
              is what it is about. Most Members feel that these criminals have
              operated for too long. I support the Committee’s views on the
              Proceeds of Crime Bill.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr A Maginness:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank all the Members who contributed to the
              debate. It has been a very good debate with some interesting
              contributions. The general welcome for the report that was
              expressed throughout the debate is reflective of the Committee and
              the common approach that it took in dealing with the proceeds of
              crime and the draft legislation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee worked harmoniously and
              co-operatively. All parties participated in the drawing up of the
              report, and it is a credit to the Assembly that that amount of
              work was done so quickly and so well. May I take this opportunity,
              as Chairperson of the Committee, to thank the Committee members,
              the Committee Clerk and the research staff who helped us with
              legal matters and research.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some Members talked about the joined-up
              approach that was characteristic of the Criminal Assets Bureau
              (CAB) in Dublin. I endorse that. The key to its success is that it
              has successfully integrated many different elements of Government
              into the CAB. That should be done with CARA; that is the key to
              success. I agree with Sir John Gorman and the other Members who
              emphasised that point.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the Republic of Ireland, the CAB has
              contributed to a significant, substantial and noticeable decline
              in crime since 1996. The Republic’s serious crime figures are at
              their lowest since the 1980s. That is directly referable to the
              CAB.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McNamee and other Members raised the issue
              of human rights. The Committee was conscious of those rights, and
              its members carefully studied the submission from the Human Rights
              Commission. The Human Rights Commission believes that innovative
              measures are being brought forward by the Government, and it
              welcomes those. The Commission, of course, gave a health warning
              to the Assembly about the legislation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no doubt that the legislation will be
              challenged in the courts on the grounds that it violates human
              rights. However, there is no human right to enjoy the proceeds of
              crime, and that is the basis on which any challenge to the
              legislation will ultimately be defeated.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Leslie mentioned the provision of resources
              for CARA. Those resources will be made available, particularly for
              Northern Ireland. I am fairly confident of that. Mr Straw has said
              that 50% of the proceeds of crime will be ploughed back into CARA
              when it is up and running.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proper thing is to defeat crime by using
              assets that have been recovered from criminals, and there is
              poetic justice in that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Serious problems affect society, but they are
              probably not as serious as in the rest of the UK or as they were
              in the Republic. Nonetheless, they are serious, and, as Mr Ervine
              and Mr O’Connor have emphasised, the public, and young people in
              particular, are scandalised by seeing known criminals enjoying the
              fruit of their ill-gotten gains. Through this draft legislation we
              can begin to end that scandal.</p>

              comprehensive answer. Those consultation exercises are most

              representative organisations, to contribute to the study by
              identifying obstacles to mobility and by proposing solutions.
              These contributions will be considered by the consultants in the

              confirm that issues such as mobile telephone roaming call charges

              examining mobility issues in the wider context of the
              British-Irish Council, looking at issues that cause difficulty in
              the movement of businesses between Northern Ireland and Great
              Britain, and between the Republic of Ireland and the rest of the
              United Kingdom? Will the Deputy First Minister assure us that he
              will be examining restrictive practices that occur in public
              tendering procedures in the Republic of Ireland and also in
              teacher appointments, so that there will be true mobility within
              these islands?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is scope for the British-Irish Council to
              examine mobility issues in the wider context. On one very specific
              aspect of mobility — transport issues — the Council has
              already agreed that the Northern Ireland Executive is in the lead.
              There are other important mobility issues that could in future be
              addressed by the British-Irish Council. One example that crops up
              occasionally — much too often, in my view — is the problems
              that the elderly face when having to go into residential homes,
              either here or in Britian. There is a great deal of bureaucracy,
              and that should not apply.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are other, more practical issues for
              businesses and people on the island of Ireland, North and South.
              Many of those issues should be looked at. The Member raised the
              question of teacher employment; I would like to get to a situation
              where any teacher on the island of Ireland could be employed in
              any school throughout Ireland, without restriction.</p>

              Ministers Haughey and Nesbitt announced the establishment of a
              forum of non-governmental organisations to provide input to the
              development of proposals for a children’s commissioner and the
              development of a children’s strategy.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The forum met on 4 and 11 May 2001. Some
              positive and useful discussions took place, focusing in particular
              on the involvement of children and young people in the development
              of the proposals. The forum has agreed to advance specific
              recommendations on how this would best be achieved, and to provide
              practical help in taking this matter forward. The forum
              demonstrates the value of working in partnership with children’s
              organisations, and it will continue to provide valuable input as
              we proceed with these proposals.</p>

              establish mechanisms through which there will be regular

              community relations programme in the current financial year is
              £1·65 million. Under present arrangements, our Department
              provides a 75% grant towards agreed expenditure by district
              councils on projects aimed at promoting better community relations
              in their areas. That includes the salaries of community relations
              officers employed by the councils. The basis on which future
              community relations funding will be provided to district councils
              will be considered in the review of overall community relations
              strategy, which is due to commence shortly.</p>

              Can a rolling programme be considered to enable people to have
              more confidence in the community development programmes, which can

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member makes a valid point. I do not
              believe that there will be a stop-start element to this, in the
              sense that we all recognise the good work that is being done by
              district councils in community relations.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Whatever the arrangements after the review, I
              envisage a central role for district councils. However, the basis
              on which future community relations funding will be provided to
              district councils will be considered in the review of the overall
              strategy. It is not possible, therefore, to give a commitment
              about continuous funding prior to the findings of that review, but
              we have approved the extension for up to three years, as the
              Member said. That will allow for continuation of funding. The
              district councils will still have a central role to play, because
              that is where the issue of community relations has the most

              community relations projects, rather than merely siphoning off
              funding to subsidise community service? There is a requirement to

              Does the First Minister agree that crimes against individuals or

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I understand the Member’s point entirely. The
              issue was addressed in Great Britain by the Crime and Disorder Act
              1998. One of the disadvantages that we face is that criminal
              justice matters are not devolved, so we are unable to address such
              issues. As has been the case many times in the past, useful
              legislation put on the statute book across the water has not been
              extended to Northern&nbsp;Ireland. We hope to deal with that in
              the long term. We are in discussion with the Northern Ireland
              Office to see how we can bring into operation in Northern Ireland
              legislation with provisions similar to those contained in the
              Crime and Disorder Act 1998. The Northern Ireland Office will
              consult us in the near future, and I hope that we can make
              progress.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member’s basic point is sound. Attacks
              that are made wholly on the basis of a person’s race or creed
              are an alarming phenomenon for anybody, and we hope that they will
              be brought to an end. In many respects, the response is a matter
              for the police. It is important that the police be supported by
              all parts of the community, so that the attacks can be ended and
              the persons responsible made amenable.</p>

              to a new Belfast office at the gasworks site this summer. The Food

              seeking planning permission to establish offices in County Clare,

              are located in Belfast and Dublin. The balance is spread
              throughout areas outside the two capitals.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">InterTradeIreland plans to provide 42 posts
              based in Newry. At present, the Special EU Programmes Body has
              three staff members in Omagh, who are carrying out important work
              in programme management, and five in Monaghan, who are working on
              the implementation of the INTERREG programme and other community
              initiatives. The remaining 21 employees are based in Belfast, and
              it is to be hoped that they too will soon be based in the regional
              areas. It is intended that the Omagh office will eventually have

              will be prepared in respect of permanent headquarters buildings
              for the NSMC secretariat. Although the possibility of using the
              former Armagh jail is likely to be one of the main options in the
              appraisal process, full consideration will also be given to other
              viable options, including new build. When a preferred option is
              identified, proposals will be submitted in the first instance to
              the two Administrations separately to identify whether funding is
              available. If so, the proposals will ultimately be submitted to

              are from the Republic of Ireland, and there are two vacancies to
              be filled from the Republic. I appreciate the Member’s comments
              with regard to the Armagh jail; the people in Armagh are to be
              congratulated on its renovation. We will look in an entirely
              neutral and thorough fashion at whether it would be an appropriate
              place for the NSMC.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">North/South activity seems to have stopped over
              the last couple of months. Does the Minister share my concern that
              meetings of the British- Irish Council have also stopped and,
              indeed, that those meetings are lagging considerably behind
              North/South Ministerial Council activity? Will the Minister assure
              the Assembly that he will seek to redress the balance and ensure
              that British-Irish Council activity reaches parity with
              North/South Ministerial Council activity?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not sure that the Member is entirely
              accurate in saying that activity has stopped. There has certainly
              been a degree of slowdown in the activity of the North/South
              Ministerial Council. Indeed, if I dare to say so, Mr Speaker,
              judging by the large swathes of blue space that can be seen on the
              Benches, something else may be distracting Members from their
              attention to business here. I dare say that the same factor has
              had an effect on the Administration in general, although I would
              not want to say that the Administration has been deleteriously
              affected by other distractions.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member made a serious point about the
              British-Irish Council, where there has been a disappointing level
              of activity. There are possibly a number of reasons for that, but
              it would, perhaps, be inappropriate for me to go into them here. I
              am anxious that we look into the matter, because as an earlier
              question from the Member’s Colleague indicated, many issues that
              are being looked at in the context of the North/South Ministerial
              Council are also highly relevant in a British-Irish Council
              context. As we move towards the full implementation of the
              agreement in June, the target that was clearly set, we are also
              anxious to see the full implementation of the British-Irish
              Council.</p>

              those that the Member mentioned where co-operation is actually
              proceeding. There will be further discussions about that, and I

              recommends the inclusion of a creative component as one of the
              five core elements of the curriculum at Key Stage 4. My Department
              is drawing up a strategy in consultation with, amongst others, the

              encouraging answer. Can he assure the House that a particular
              effort will be made to target social need? Will he liaise with
              other Departments, particularly the Department of Education, so
              that the question of literacy and numeracy emerges as a very

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Targeting social need is a common thread that
              runs through all of the Departments and everything that we do as
              an Executive and a Government. I can give the Member that
              assurance on behalf of the Department of Culture, Arts and

              on behalf of their Departments.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to literacy and numeracy, I do not
              want to stray into the responsibility of another Department, but
              we are working with the Department of Education and with the
              Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment on the ‘Unlocking
              Creativity’ initiative. That involves looking at how to embed
              creativity in the curriculum and how to teach creativity in the
              classroom. We recognise that people are the prime resource in
              Northern Ireland and that the future prosperity of Northern
              Ireland will increasingly depend on the creativity and
              adaptability of its people. We are moving into a revolution in
              ongoing social and economic activity worldwide.</p>

              Therefore I have not undertaken such an assessment. Horse and dog
              racing are matters for the Department of Agriculture and Rural
              Development. I understand that betting at horse and dog tracks and
              in licensed bookmaking shops is prohibited in Northern Ireland on
              Sundays under the Betting, Gaming, Lotteries and Amusements

              have expressed similar reservations but also concern at the delay
              in the introduction of Sunday on-course betting. Does the Minister
              agree that culture and leisure activities should not be restricted
              to six days a week, particularly if the agriculture and tourist

              six days a week.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Horse and dog racing have been legal on a
              Sunday since 1996, although I understand that racing interests do
              not consider them financially viable because it is illegal to have
              betting facilities on a Sunday. That is a matter for the Minister

              gambling laws was being undertaken in Great Britain and that that
              might have had implications for Northern Ireland. That is a matter

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I deplore the retention of rule 21, and I have
              made this clear on many occasions in the Assembly. However, it is
              the responsibility of the GAA to change rule 21, and such a change
              can be made only on the basis of a vote taken at the association’s
              annual congress.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It must be recognised that the GAA is one of
              the major sporting organisations in the Province, attracting many
              thousands of supporters, and, as such, it qualifies for support on
              the same basis as other sports. Funding for sport in Northern
              Ireland, both exchequer and lottery, is made available by the
              Sports Council for Northern Ireland, which has an obligation to
              address all sections of the sporting community involved in
              recognised sports.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is it not the case that there are thousands of
              young people participating in sports who are being discriminated
              against through lack of funding for their sports? The Taylor
              report’s recommendations for safety in soccer stadiums, for
              example, have not been implemented in Northern Ireland, yet we
              have a sport being funded that excludes people. Other inclusive
              sports are being excluded. Surely there is something inherently
              wrong. If the GAA cannot get its act together and scrap rule 21,
              it should be told that it will not be given any more money until
              it includes everybody in its sport.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We would all like to see rule 21 go. It is
              outmoded and outdated, and it has no place in a modern society. It
              is not conducive to building an inclusive society, and I agree
              with the Member’s sentiments. However, I am also aware that
              there is a strong lobby in the GAA to remove this contentious
              rule, and I hope that it is only a matter of time before the GAA’s
              annual congress votes to remove it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member referred to the Taylor report. It is
              important to note that the House voted to give approximately
              £5·3 million over three years to support the changes recommended
              in the Taylor report. The money was not made available earlier
              because we suffered under direct rule.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No Minister in the Northern Ireland Office
              bothered to chase the very substantial funding that was available,

              question. The GAA introduced this rule in 1887 — a very long
              time ago. The ban remained in place until 1893 when it was lifted
              for 10 years. It has remained in place ever since, one of a number
              of ban rules that the GAA drew up at that time. I am certainly not
              one for decrying tradition, but if you fail to move with the times

              Literature is an area of the arts in which Northern Ireland has

              Adamson has made reference, but it is true that there is incentive
              in the Irish Republic that exempts writers and artists from tax on
              income derived from their creative works. This has been enormously
              beneficial to the Republic, to its economy and, in particular, to
              its film industry, which has managed to benefit greatly. We have
              seen major developments there over the last 20 years, which have
              had a lot to do with tax concessions. They can offer better tax
              breaks to film producers than we can. This is one of the areas

              by my Department and the Department of the Environment, which is
              involved on account of its interest in environment and heritage.
              We expect that response to be ready by the end of August. I expect

              codes has had an effect on such features as townland names and
              local district areas. A generation ago, most people would have
              known around 100 district areas by name. Now they know perhaps
              only half a dozen. We have lost so much because of the Post Office’s

              and was likely to be considered again in the spring. I can now say
              that the next meeting of the Sports Council for Northern Ireland’s

              slippage.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is the Minister aware of the number of

              feel that they are discriminated against, financially and
              otherwise, by the irrational view that darts is not a sport? Can
              the Minister take the initiative on behalf of countless people in
              Northern Ireland and recognise darts as a sport? That would, I
              hope, put pressure on the Sports Council for Northern Ireland, and
              other bodies, to have darts recognised more widely.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The slippage was not within my control — the
              home country sports councils make those decisions. They are made
              on a UK-wide basis. This will be considered again in June. Mr
              Close will be aware that darts was not considered a sport in the
              past because there was insufficient physical activity involved.
              Large numbers of people in Northern Ireland play darts, and they
              regard it as a sport. Darts would have access to lottery and
              Exchequer funding if it were recognised as a sport, and benefits
              would accrue to those who play darts. However, it is a UK-wide
              matter and a matter for the home country sports councils, and I am
              awaiting their decision in June.</p>

              delivering priorities identified in the Programme for Government.
              Our aspiration is to create a library service that promotes and
              encourages an environment of creativity, a culture of reading and
              learning and electronic access to the wider world of information.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have commissioned a review of library
              services to assess the extent to which the service is currently
              fulfilling its aims, and to create an agreed vision for the
              future. A steering group, chaired by my Department and comprising
              representatives of those organisations with statutory
              responsibility, has been established to provide overall strategic
              direction for the review. A working group, with representatives

              services. I was going to ask whether there was a programme of
              takeover and transition between his Department and the education
              and library boards. There obviously is. I take it that that is
              what the Minister means.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We will conduct a review of the Library
              Service. That is an area of responsibility that we have inherited.
              It is important to scope and audit it, to look at where it stands
              now and where it is going in the future. The handover from the
              Department of Education is not going smoothly, particularly in
              terms of the resources that came with the libraries.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are all aware how seriously under-resourced
              libraries are. Last year, I managed to secure only an additional
              £500,000 for library capital development, which, nonetheless,
              allowed me to announce new libraries for Strabane, Castlederg,
              and, last week, for Ballymena. In addition, we have purchased a
              site for the relocation of Irvinestown library. The need for
              funding will be considered in the review, because the transfer of
              responsibilities for libraries from the Department of Education
              did not bring with it the resources that were required to
              discharge those responsibilities.</p>

              Around £20 million of funding will be allocated as part of
              measures designed to provide training for farmers, investment in
              agricultural holdings and diversification of agriculture
              activities. That will be implemented by the Department’s agri-food

              measures will be targeted at farmers and farm families through
              training, which will involve the creation of local farms as model
              units, and peer mentoring. There will also be assistance for
              groups of farmers working to improve farm produce quality, and for
              those who wish to diversify into non-farming activities by helping

              incurred by keeping out of pig production for 10 years. When
              issued with an application form, applicants were advised that no

              Ireland are disadvantaged but have the potential to develop and
              sustain a strong tourism product based on their natural resources.
              It is considered that the core of the criteria should be rural
              areas that are, first, disadvantaged and, secondly, have an
              official designation in respect of their landscape or
              environmental qualities such as environmentally sensitive areas (ESAs)
              or areas of outstanding natural beauty (AONBs).</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As these designations relate only to natural
              features, it is proposed that the boundaries of the proposed
              target areas should be based on disadvantaged wards that overlap
              with ESAs or AONBs. This should be adjusted to take account of
              issues such as geographic coherence, socio-economic coherence,
              critical mass, existing tourism strategies, border location,
              equality of opportunity and community relations.</p>

              co-ordinate and deal with these issues on a cross- departmental

              funds, it is now possible for my Department to undertake a £20
              million LEADER+ programme. Of the £20 million available, 85%, or
              approximately £17 million, will be allocated to local action
              groups under Action 1 to support the economic development of
              Northern Ireland’s rural areas. Approximately £2·2 million, or
              11%, will be made available to local action groups under Action 2
              to encourage effective co-operation between rural areas.
              Networking will receive 3%, and a further 1% will be allocated to

              hoped to secure Commission approval in the near future. The
              LEADER+ programme will be delivered by locally based partnerships
              known as local action groups (LAGs) which will be selected through
              a competitive selection procedure. I hope to commence the
              selection process by inviting applications in June 2001.</p>

              Therefore although all rural areas are eligible to apply, the
              selection process may not result in all areas being covered by a
              local action group. The programme defines the eligible area for
              LEADER+ as all parts of Northern Ireland, excluding the Belfast
              metropolitan area, the city of Derry/ Londonderry and towns with a
              population of more than 5,000. The programme will retain the
              flexibility to support projects located in urban settings in cases
              in which the projects will benefit rural areas and if it makes
              sense that they should be located in a town.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The programme has supported over 100 community-

              more than 1,300 projects, and the 15 LEADER II local allocation

              900 jobs have been secured. For example, Slieve Gullion Courtyard
              received funding towards redevelopment costs to establish the
              courtyard as a quality tourism, residential, conference and
              hospitality venue. The rural development programme has made a

              six-year strategy before this autumn. The new phase of the rural
              development programme has been the subject of extensive
              consultation for almost three years. The level of interest in the
              programme that has been shown by the broad rural community is a
              measure of the Department’s success in developing a genuine
              partnership with rural people. I am determined to build upon that

              to rural people — community organisations, farmers and their
              families and rural businesses. Funding for the new rural
              development programme is expected to be around £75 million, which
