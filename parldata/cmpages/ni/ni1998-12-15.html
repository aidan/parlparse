                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Initial Presiding Officer:</p>
                </b>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Before moving to item 5 on the agenda I wish
                to draw some matters to the attention of the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, the debate on the motion and the
                amendments to it will be time-limited to five hours and will be
                followed by the Adjournment debate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, three amendments have been tabled
                and are published on the Marshalled List. All of these are
                competent and have different effects. Therefore all three may be
                moved in the order in which they appear on the list. The motion
                will be moved and then each amendment in turn, with Mr Neeson’s
                second amendment moved formally. At the end of the debate the
                votes on the amendments will be taken in the order in which they
                appear on the Marshalled List.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will remind Members then, as I do now, that
                if amendment 1 is carried, it then becomes the substantive
                motion, and amendments 2 and 3 fall. If amendment 1 is not
                carried, but amendment 2 is carried, it similarly becomes the
                substantive motion, and amendment 3 falls. If amendments 1 and 2
                are not carried, and amendment 3 is carried, it is then added to
                the motion, and the substantive motion, as amended, is voted
                upon.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Standing Orders have given rise to a
                further technical problem. Once amendments are moved, it is not
                possible under our Standing Orders for a Member to have right of
                reply and to speak for a second time. Also it is not technically
                possible for the mover of an amendment, subsequent to the debate
                — and perhaps influenced by it — to withdraw his amendment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There being no opportunity under the Standing
                Orders for the mover of an amendment to speak for a second time,
                and since it seems only proper that an amendment should be able
                to be withdrawn if its mover so chooses, I will give an
                opportunity to the mover of each of the amendments to indicate
                whether or not, at that point, his amendment is moved.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I remind Members that, with Royal Assent
                having been given to the Northern Ireland Act, the Assembly now
                has absolute privilege, rather than the qualified privilege that
                obtained before. However, this does not remove the obligation on
                Members to remain within the bounds of civility and reasonable
                courtesy and, indeed, to observe the proprieties of
                parliamentary conduct in parlance. I will try to ensure that
                these are adhered to in whichever language is used.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr Ian Paisley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr&nbsp;Presiding
                Officer. If a Member wishes to withdraw his amendment does he
                simply stand and do so formally, or does he have a right to
                speak?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Initial Presiding Officer:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will clarify the position again.
                Unfortunately, the Initial Standing Orders do not provide for
                the mover of an amendment to speak again or to wind up, as is
                the case in other places.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Member who moves an amendment must have an
                opportunity to withdraw it. Otherwise it would not be possible
                to have a probing amendment or to have one’s course of action
                influenced by debate. I will therefore ask the mover of each
                amendment, at the appropriate point, if he still wants his
                amendment to be moved. This will not be giving an opportunity
                for a further speech; it will simply be giving an opportunity
                for a mover of an amendment to indicate whether he wants to
                proceed with his amendment or to withdraw it at that stage.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hussey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a further point of order,
                Mr&nbsp;Presiding Officer. I am concerned about remarks made on
                the radio this morning regarding the designation of Members of
                the Assembly. The Leader of the Alliance Party asserted that the
                terms &quot;Nationalist&quot; and &quot;Unionist&quot; were
                sectarian labels. I request that you rule on that and, if your
                ruling is as I believe it should be, that you ask the Leader of
                the Alliance Party to withdraw his remark.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Initial Presiding Officer:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the Assembly, the terms that you mention
                are proper parliamentary parlance. Their use outside the
                Chamber, and for political purposes, is another matter, on which
                it would not be proper for me to rule. For the purposes of the
                Assembly, the terms &quot;Unionist&quot; and
                &quot;Nationalist&quot; are an essential part of the rules of
                procedure.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Neeson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Further to that point of order,
                Mr&nbsp;Presiding Officer. Mr Hussey having given me notice that
                he was going to raise this issue I consulted my dictionary.
                Against the word &quot;sectarian&quot; one finds &quot;member or
                adherent of a sect&quot;.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Initial Presiding Officer:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What you are saying may be a proper
                justification of things that you have said elsewhere, but it is
                not a point of order at this stage.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGrady:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Presiding Officer, can you give a
                technical clarification of the Order Paper as originally set
                out? A footnote about Mr&nbsp;McCartney’s motion indicates
                that the 14 days mentioned there would extend to Monday
                18&nbsp;January 1999 because of the Christmas recess. Despite
                the Christmas recess dates that you announced yesterday, all the
                amendments indicate a performance date of 21 December. How does
                the recess impinge on that? What procedures would the Assembly
                follow if any of these amendments were carried?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Initial Presiding Officer:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is generally regarded as preferable for
                motions to refer to performance dates — as you elegantly
                describe them — rather than numbers of days. Where numbers of
                days are included in the terms of a motion, they are to be taken
                as working days, which do not include weekends or recesses. The
                date of 18&nbsp;January was chosen because consultations with my
                Advisory Committee indicated that a two-week recess commencing
                on 18 December would be appropriate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, it would be entirely proper for the
                Assembly to be recalled during the recess to deal with any
                urgent matters, should that be its wish. That could be done, and
                would probably best be done in liaison with myself. The
                Secretary of State is content to oblige us in that regard.
                Therefore if a resolution were to require a report by 21
                December, and the report could not be available before that
                date, there would be consultations and perhaps eagerness to have
                a sitting to enable the report to be received as soon as it was
                available. But it is not for me to give a ruling when the
                motion, amended or not, has not been passed.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Noting that</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">a. no proposals under paragraph 16 of strand

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">c. any party inextricably linked with a
                paramilitary organisation retaining arms cannot give a total and
                absolute commitment to exclusively democratic means of resolving
                differences on political issues or oppose the use or threat of
                force by others for such purposes,</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">this Assembly calls upon the First Minister
                (Designate) and Deputy First Minister (Designate) to lay a
                report on these matters before the House within 14&nbsp;days.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that the motion will command support
                from every democrat in the Assembly, regardless of party. The
                Assembly aspires to create democratic institutions of government
                for the benefit of every citizen, regardless of creed or
                political loyalty. No democratic institution worthy of the name,
                can exist if it contains the political representatives of an
                unlawfully armed organisation which is committed to bringing
                about change by the use or the threat of acts of terrorism. Such
                an organisation which states that if the aims of those who
                speaks for it politically, and with whom it is inextricably
                linked, are not met, it reserves the right to achieve those aims
                by the use of violence and to retain the weapons that it
                currently possesses to make good that threat.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Belfast Agreement has the avowed purpose
                of bringing peace through democratic institutions of government,
                and is alleged to contain the recognition of the principle that
                any change in Northern&nbsp;Ireland’s constitutional position
                can be brought about only with the consent of the majority.
                Sinn&nbsp;Féin/IRA have never subscribed to those principles.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What is more important is that no agreement
                can set aside the fundamental principles of democratic
                procedure. No agreement can override or supersede the central
                and basic principles of democracy itself, nor can any political
                party in a democracy claim that it has an electoral mandate to
                substitute violence for peaceful persuasion and threaten
                democratic institutions with violence if its demands are not
                met.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no record of a minority grouping
                ceasing to use violence for political aims before its objectives
                have been achieved or the forces of democratic government have
                defeated it. The IRA is no exception.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the beginning of the peace process the
                fundamental principles of the democratic process were
                emphasised. It was made clear that the requirements for
                participation were not the demands of parties, or the conditions
                imposed by parties, but were the essential demands of democracy
                itself. To use or threaten violence is a violation of democracy,
                and a determination to retain weapons and the means of violence
                constitutes a threat in itself.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Downing Street declaration of
                15&nbsp;December&nbsp;1993 made it clear that a permanent end to
                the use of paramilitary violence, or support for it, a
                commitment to exclusively peaceful means, and adherence to the
                democratic process were the necessary criteria to establish the
                entitlement to participate in democratic politics and enter into
                dialogue. After the joint declaration, Dick Spring, at that time
                the Republic’s Foreign Minister, gave Dáil&nbsp;Eireann his
                Government’s understanding:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;We are talking about the handing up of
                arms and are insisting that it would not simply be a temporary
                cessation to see what the political process had to offer. There
                can be no equivocation in relation to the determination of both
                governments in this regard.&quot;</p>
                </font><i><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">10.45 am</p>
                </font></i><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">From that moment the history of both
                Governments on this issue has been the opposite of that
                statement. Far from witnessing unequivocal determination, it has
                been one of temporising vacillation and weakness. Successive
                positions have been taken up only to be resiled from in the face
                of the threat of violence. The IRA, like Hitler in 1938, must
                have been utterly astonished at the weakness of its adversaries.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On 1 June 1994, in Dáil Eireann, Mr Spring

                of giving it a try and if it does not work, returning to the
                bomb and the bullet&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is what Assemblyman Molloy told a Sinn
                Féin audience they would do if the political process did not
                yield the required results: they would go back to doing what
                they do best. In order to do so, they must necessarily retain
                their weapons and their Semtex. It is that threat, and capacity
                to make the threat good, that has produced in successive British
                Governments a craven policy of appeasement, of surrender to
                every threat of renewed mainland violence, of concession to
                every fresh and increasing demand from a criminal conspiracy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Throughout the talks, the Government’s line
                was one of a twin-track policy of decommissioning in parallel
                with political progress towards an agreement. Who did not hear
                this twin-track policy being repeated with nauseating regularity
                by the Secretary of State, Dr Mowlam? During the talks not a
                single bullet, or ounce of Semtex was delivered.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An agreement was reached at the end of those
                talks on 10 April 1998. The talk’s train left the station and
                reached its destination, but the decommissioning train never
                left at all. Since 10&nbsp;April&nbsp;1998, not one single
                bullet has been handed over nor, according to the IRA, will one
                ever be handed over until their objective of a united Irish
                Socialist republic is achieved.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At every point Unionists who trusted the
                Government were deceived by promises and pledges that were never
                intended to be fulfilled. How has the principle been observed
                that only those abiding by the democratic process would be free,
                not just to participate in politics but to participate as
                Ministers in Government? How could the Prime Minister and the
                Secretary of State contemplate having as Ministers in Government
                members of a party, which they both claim is inextricably linked
                not only with an armed terrorist organisation but publicly
                declares its intention to remained armed until its political
                objectives are achieved.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proposal to place Sinn Féin in
                government under these circumstances is utterly outrageous and
                does such violence to the principles of democracy as to make it
                possible only if the people have been brainwashed into oblivion.
                Is there anyone with the remotest interest in political life who
                does not know that the highest offices in both Sinn Féin and
                the IRA are occupied by the same people? In ‘The Sunday Times’
                last week it declared what we already know: Mr&nbsp;Adams and
                Mr&nbsp;McGuinness are members of the seven-man IRA army
                council. They are inextricably linked; they are welded together.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While General Pinochet is threatened with
                extradition, while Saddam Hussein is threatened with extinction,
                Messrs Adams and McGuinness are welcomed through the front door
                of Number 10.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Why? Because they, unlike Pinochet and Saddam
                Hussein, have the capacity, through their inextricable links
                with the IRA, to threaten destruction on the financial heart of
                the City of London. For this reason, while declaring Sinn Féin
                and the IRA to be inextricably linked, Sinn Féin was accepted
                in the Belfast Agreement as separate and distinct from the IRA.
                This fiction enabled Sinn&nbsp;Féin to confirm a commitment to
                the total disarmament of all paramilitary organisations — the
                same fiction that enabled it to sign up to the Mitchell
                principles.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The reality, as opposed to the fiction, is
                that neither Sinn Féin fronting the IRA nor the PUP fronting
                Loyalist terrorists has any connection whatever with democracy
                or its fundamental principles. They are the political masks for
                organisations who have murdered, mutilated and destroyed;
                organisations which to the present day are engaged in murder,
                shootings, beatings, intimidation, forced exile, extortion and
                every form of crime.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The ceasefire is a macabre fraud. Since the
                beginning of 1998 nearly 500 acts or threats of violence from
                murder to enforced exile have been recorded by Families Against
                Intimidation and authenticated by the RUC. Let me give Members
                the roll-call. Brutal beatings and shootings are a daily
                occurrence. From 1 to 25&nbsp;November (last month) the IRA
                exiled nine people, intimidated 67, shot two people and beat
                seven severely — a total of 85, and they are just the ones we
                know about. By the end of the month the number was actually over
                100. Let us look now at the Loyalists’ cricket score —
                exiles, nine; intimidations, 48; shootings, five; beatings,
                seven — a total of 69.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Secretary of State and the security
                Minister, Adam Ingram, simply ignore these facts as unhelpful to
                the peace process. It is no excuse to say, as the Secretary of
                State responded to me in Parliament, that there is no evidence
                against the individual perpetrators. Of course there is no
                evidence, because those who are beaten are threatened with
                murder, and those who are exiled are threatened with death if
                they remain. But these fully authenticated brutalities are not
                simply the work of individual perpetrators.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The indictment is not against individuals;
                the indictment is lodged against the organisations and the
                political parties who front them and mask them. These fully
                authenticated acts of brutality are being carried out in areas
                which the police, indeed the Chief Constable, admit are
                dominated by paramilitary groups — the IRA and the UVF —
                that are fronted by parties in this Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Do Members recall that during the period of
                President Clinton’s visit not a squib went off and no one was
                injured? Do Members recall the six-week sanitisation period that
                was required before the entry to talks? Not only were there no
                explosions, not only were there no attacks on the military
                forces, there were no beatings, there were no shootings, there
                were no exiles and there were no intimidations. Why? Because
                Sinn Féin/IRA decreed that there would be none. It would not
                have been politically expedient for them to have been carried
                out.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let me finish by saying this: no mandate, no
                agreement, no government, no parties can supersede or set aside
                the fundamental and immutable principles of democracy, morality
                and justice.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have different political aims and
                objectives from the SDLP and from others in the Assembly.
                However, I share with the SDLP and most of the other parties
                here a belief in democracy. Violence has no part to play in a
                political party. A party that claims to be democratic cannot be
                inextricably linked with terror, murder, mutilation and death.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a way forward — and I say this
                without malice or political gain, but as a democrat. It will
                entail every party, both Nationalist and Unionist, recognising
                that the common bonds of democracy are infinitely preferable in
                the long run to the bonds of an Irish Nationalism that yokes
                people to a party inextricably linked with the forces of
                Republican terror. I call upon all democrats, all people of
                goodwill, all people who are revolted by political violence and
                terror to join with me, regardless of party, to support this
                motion.</p>

                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I reaffirm my strong support for the Belfast
                Agreement. It was a long process, and the agreement was a
                compromise but an honourable one. The people of Northern Ireland
                and the Republic of Ireland voted in their thousands to show
                their support for those who reached this agreement on Good
                Friday. The strongest opponents of it are those who walked out.
                There are now threats from individuals to walk out if an
                Executive is formed. This is a good agreement, and it is my
                party’s wish to have it implemented without any further
                delays.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The vast majority of people of Northern
                Ireland and of the island of Ireland want to see the agreement
                working. Mr McCartney referred to the document released
                yesterday by Families Against Intimidation and Terror (FAIT),
                which underlines the continuing violence in our society. Almost
                1,000 children in Northern Ireland this year have suffered from
                human-rights abuses. This is unacceptable in any civilised
                society.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The problem of the continuing violence dates
                back to the talks process when the Mitchell principles were
                diluted not only by the two Governments but by the participants
                of the process. The Alliance Party raised several issues of
                dispute about breaches of the Mitchell principles. Neither
                Government acted on any of these issues. The problem started
                there.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.00 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The importance of the Alliance Party’s
                amendment is that it underlines concern in Northern&nbsp;Ireland
                not only about the continuing violence but about the threat of
                violence. I am greatly concerned that some Assembly Members
                still refuse to oppose the use or the threat of use of force by
                others for political means.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Mr&nbsp;McCartney rightly said, the
                violence comes from several sources. I was deeply shocked and
                disturbed by the IRA’s statement last week. Decommissioning is
                an essential part of this process. It was an important part of
                the agreement and the Assembly cannot fudge the issue. My aim
                and that of my Colleagues is to ensure that decommissioning is
                carried out as part of this process.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;During the transitional period between
                the elections to the Northern&nbsp;Ireland Assembly and the

                transitional Administration and the Irish Government operating
                in the North/South Ministerial Council will undertake a work
                programme, in consultation with the British Government, covering
                at least 12 subject areas, with a view to identifying and
                agreeing by 31&nbsp;October&nbsp;1998 areas where co-operation
                and implementation for mutual benefit will take place.&quot;</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sadly, 31&nbsp;October has come and gone, and
                it does not reflect well on the First Minister (Designate) and
                Deputy First Minister (Designate) that that deadline has been
                missed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The latest failures — only last week — to
                reach an agreement on structures of government for
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland and on the North/South implementation
                bodies have caused a great deal of despair. Unionism and
                Nationalism could not agree, and that is the bottom line. It is
                absurd to hear, particularly from some Unionists, calls for
                three Nationalist and three Unionist implementation bodies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What should be foremost in their minds is the
                setting up of Government Departments and implementation bodies
                for North/South relations that will be for the good of the
                people of Northern&nbsp;Ireland and for the good of the people
                of the island of Ireland. That should be the first priority, not
                that there are three Unionist and three Nationalist
                implementation bodies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Meanwhile, as they fudge around, the
                extremists on both sides are surfacing. Members will be aware of
                the violence in Derry on Saturday; I hope that there will not be
                any violence in Portadown this Saturday. Clearly, the continuing
                threat from the Real IRA and the Continuity IRA does create
                problems. Where a vacuum exists, and we have experience of 30
                years of violence in Northern&nbsp;Ireland, the extremists on
                all sides take advantage.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly charged the First and the Deputy
                First Ministers with responsibilities. Yesterday we had an
                excellent debate on proposals for a natural gas pipeline for the
                north-west and another debate on health issues with the
                Minister. It was clear from both those debates that Members from
                all parties want to see the transfer of power to the Assembly.</p>

                nature of earlier discussions between the various brands of
                Unionism, Nationalism and Republicanism, that today’s debate
                would continue in that unfortunate vein. This fractiousness
                flies in the face of the clearly expressed will in our community
                to find a new way of dealing with issues that have traditionally
                divided us. All politicians and political parties will have to
                cross the chasm of mistrust that exists as a consequence of the
                conflict and division. We must find a new language and learn to
                hear each other. We must also learn to understand the fears and
                worries of each other’s community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has to be pointed out, and this is a
                simple statement of fact, that there is no such party as Sinn
                Féin/IRA. No such party signed up to the Good Friday Agreement.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Well, some people might believe in Santa
                Claus, and I will leave that with the Member to decide.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some parties have shown open-mindedness and
                generosity and have recognised the different contributions that
                have made the peace process possible. Combined contributions
                were made in spite of the ungenerous, begrudging and hostile
                attitude of people who claim to be constitutional politicians.
                They seem to have a paranoid fear of the silence of guns; they
                seem to depend on continued conflict to justify their own
                political analyses and, in some cases, to sustain their
                political careers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What do people have to fear from peace? That
                is the question we have to ask and the reason Sinn&nbsp;Féin is
                moving its amendment. Why are Members so frightened of the
                alternative to what we have experienced throughout the history
                of this sectarian statelet?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not use this language to offend. It as a
                matter of historical fact. When I talk to individual Unionist
                and Nationalist representatives, they are prepared to accept it,
                and if they can accept it privately, why can they not accept
                openly the need to work collectively to create a new political
                dispensation for us all?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Sinn Féin mandate, which has been so
                vociferously challenged from across the Floor, has been
                validated, renewed, reinvigorated and strengthened in election
                after election. Sinn Féin is a registered political party —
                open and transparent. Our books may be examined, and our books
                have been examined. Sinn&nbsp;Féin’s analysis and policy is
                decided at our annual party conferences, at our ard-fheis, in
                open debate. The media are present throughout the party’s
                policy discussions. All Sinn&nbsp;Féin’s policies are printed
                and published and available on request. I will supply copies of
                these to any party that wants to examine them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sinn&nbsp;Féin is absolutely committed to
                resolving the conflict and divisions in our society by entirely
                peaceful means. This is a statement of record. Sinn&nbsp;Féin
                is opposed to punishment beatings and supports the establishment
                of a new policing service that would be civilianised, civilised
                and representative of the entire community. That is also a
                statement of record.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sinn Féin has stated on the record, on many
                occasions, its determination to achieve in Ireland a democratic
                settlement which will see the removal of the gun for ever from
                Irish politics. That is our commitment, and we want to work —
                indeed we need to work — with all shades of political opinion
                to achieve that objective.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have stated this morning in interviews that
                without Unionism and, equally, without Republicanism the peace

                Loyalist organisations such as Ulster Resistance. I wonder what
                would be said of those who, by their own admission, gave
                political cover to an organisation which retained guns that were
                imported from South Africa with the help of the British Army
                spy, Brian Nelson?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members of the United Kingdom Unionist Party
                have clearly set out their stall. What is the status of their
                statement, and who makes up the UK Unionist Party? They have
                clearly stated their intention to destroy the Good Friday
                Agreement, and the clear purpose of the motion is to undermine,
                subvert and destroy the Good Friday Agreement, and to prevent
                any implementation, let alone the speedy implementation, of its
                provisions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our amendment accepts the need for a report
                from the First and Deputy First Ministers Designate to explain
                the difficulties that they are experiencing and the undue delay
                in establishing the shadow Executive, the North/South
                Ministerial Council and the implementation bodies. The Good
                Friday Agreement is already in default, and there are constant
                predictions that we will miss the February deadline for the
                devolution of political power. There is no valid reason for the
                failure to implement the spirit and detail of the agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It must be apparent to everyone that the
                difficulty in the peace process is not caused by the
                decommissioning issue. Begrudgery and a refusal to accept
                collective responsibility as parties for a new beginning and for
                the failures of the past are the causes. There is really no
                point in continuing to point the finger and say &quot;It was not
                my fault; it was yours.&quot; We all failed. The experiences of
                people over the past generation have replicated the failure that
                has bedeviled the North of Ireland since partition. By working
                together, we have an opportunity to change all that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On Good Friday we all agreed to a form of
                coalition Government. We do not talk about that as positively
                and persistently as we should, but that is what we agreed. That
                Government would be representative of all shades of political
                opinion, and would satisfy the criteria on establishing a
                mandate from the people under the d’Hondt system. Four parties
                achieved that agreement, and there could be a remarkable
                coalition. It would certainly be a remarkable demonstration of a
                new beginning for a political entity that has manifestly failed.
                There can be no satisfaction in dwelling on that failure, or
                insisting that we should continue to live with it. Let us change
                it. Let us abandon all the nonsense of point scoring and
                recognise what we agreed on Good Friday and go ahead. Let us by
                doing that achieve the removal of all guns.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are 130,000 licensed weapons in the
                Unionist community. Would they be given up willingly? We know
                why that would not happen. There is considerable fear and
                distrust and a history that will take time to undo, and
                attitudes that will take time to unlearn. The genuine concerns
                that created the conditions of conflict continue to exist.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to make some comments on the motion
                and the amendments which have been moved. In the time available
                it will not be possible to deal with all of the issues involved,
                but I will touch on the key aspects. The common feature of all
                the proposals before us, leaving aside the preambles, is that
                they call, in one form or another, for a report from the First
                and the Deputy First Ministers (Designate) to the Assembly on
                the matters which we have all been engaged in over recent months
                and which relate to moving the Assembly to the point where it is
                possible for devolution to take place. Calling for a report on
                these matters is not unreasonable.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The question arises as to the timing of such
                a report and the terms of the motion and the amendments that
                call for it. Reference has been made to the discussions which
                are taking place in a fairly intensive way. I spent from
                11.00&nbsp;am to 11.00&nbsp;pm yesterday, with very few breaks,
                involved in them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The discussions at present are at a fairly
                delicate stage, and I can see no advantage to the Assembly or to
                the public interest in putting the position which I think the
                discussions have reached into the public domain. The discussions
                will resume as soon as possible, but I do not begrudge the time
                given to the Assembly on the matter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not think there is any advantage to be
                gained from giving my view of where the discussions had reached
                at 11&nbsp;o’clock last night, because other people might have
                a different view. It is not unusual in the midst of discussions
                for people to form different views of precisely where we are,
                and we saw the effects of that difference of view over what had
                or had not been agreed only 10&nbsp;days ago. I do not see any
                point in going into detail on those matters.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are focusing in those discussions
                primarily on the question of North/South co-operation, but we
                are also taking into account the other strand-one issue, the
                future structures for the Northern Ireland Assembly. On these
                matters Mr Neeson was perfectly correct to say that the
                agreement set a target date (not a deadline — and there is a
                difference) of 31 October, and it was with that in mind that, on
                14 September, in this Chamber, I called for the parties to
                engage in active discussions on these matters.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sadly, that call was not immediately
                responded to for a variety of reasons. It was not until
                26&nbsp;October that it became possible for the Deputy First
                Minister and I to initiate a round of consultations, and those
                consultations are ongoing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was not until 30&nbsp;October that we had
                any formal communication from the Irish Government — a
                necessary element in these discussions. At this stage we are not
                in a position to decide among ourselves what the areas of
                North/South co-operation should be, and then impose that on the
                Irish Government. That would fly in the face of the principle of
                consent. Since we received the views of the Irish Government, we
                have continued to work on the matter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some of the amendments call for a report to
                be made to the Assembly by 21&nbsp;December. That is not
                impossible. We might be in a position to make a detailed report
                by that date. I should very much like that to be the case, and I
                am quite hopeful about that. However, I do not want to go into
                detail at this stage lest I raise too many expectations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At this stage it is not possible to be more
                definite, and for that reason the amendments moved by the
                Alliance Party and Sinn Féin could be extremely damaging to the
                process, as they call for a final report. Mr&nbsp;Neeson quoted
                the original resolution of 1 July. If a final report were made,
                it would discharge that motion, and would leave the Assembly
                rudderless. We would then have to meet again to consider how to
                proceed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It would not be in the interests of the
                Assembly or in the public interest to discharge the resolution
                of 1 July, thus leaving the First Minister (Designate) and the
                Deputy First Minister (Designate) without any instruction or
                authority on the conduct of business. Mr&nbsp;Neeson declared
                his support for the agreement. I am glad to hear that, but I
                wonder why he has made a proposal which would damage its
                implementation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall advise members of my party to vote
                against the Sinn Féin and Alliance Party amendments, which are
                substantially the same. I can understand why elements in Sinn
                Féin might want to throw a spanner in the works, but I wonder
                why the Alliance Party would want to do that. I therefore
                caution its members to think again.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I turn now to the substantive motion which
                has been proposed by Mr&nbsp;McCartney, although I am not sure
                in what capacity he is acting at the moment. The motion calls
                upon the First Minister (Designate) and the Deputy First
                Minister (Designate) to lay a report on these matters. As I have
                said, I do not consider the request for a report to be
                unreasonable. I see from the footnote that that would mean that
                the Assembly would require a report by Monday 18&nbsp;January
                1999, taking into consideration the dates for recess that were
                referred to earlier by the Initial Presiding Officer.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not think it is unreasonable to ask for
                a report within that timescale, although it may be, as previous
                reports have been, simply a report on progress to date. My clear
                hope is that we will be able to make a final report before that
                date, but, as I said earlier, I do not wish the Assembly to bind
                itself to a final report on that day simply to discharge the
                motion of 1 July. Therefore it would not be unreasonable to
                expect the kind of report that is set out in this motion and,
                for that reason, I would be prepared to support it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is another reason for my being minded
                to support the motion. So far, I have commented only on the
                substance of the motion rather than the preamble. Paragraph c of
                the preamble reads</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;any party inextricably linked with a
                paramilitary organisation retaining arms cannot give a total and
                absolute commitment to exclusively democratic means&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have been making that point for many
                months, and we are glad to see that Mr&nbsp;McCartney agrees
                with us, and is drawing attention to the key provision in the
                Agreement which requires a total and absolute commitment to
                exclusively democratic and peaceful means.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.30 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That requirement is mentioned in four
                different places in the first few pages of the agreement. It is
                on the first page, and it appears three times in the strand-one
                section: in paragraphs 25 and 35 and in paragraph (b) under the
                heading &quot;Pledge of Office&quot;. And in case
                Mr&nbsp;McLaughlin has forgotten it — least he mistakenly
                think that to hold office, one has only to qualify under d’Hondt
                — I remind him of that obligation. Strand one of the
                agreement, at paragraph 25, clearly provides that persons who
                are not committed to peaceful means</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;should be excluded or removed&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the Member turns to the section on
                decommissioning, which ought to be engraved on his heart as it
                imposes on him an obligation to decommission, he will note that
                paragraph 1 is expressly cross-referenced to paragraph 25 of
                strand&nbsp;one. Nothing could be clearer. It is not a
                precondition; it is a requirement of the agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am glad that Mr McCartney now supports my
                party’s position that under the agreement there is a clear
                obligation to decommissioning, that he has moved away from the
                position of declaring Sinn&nbsp;Féin to be right.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have just one minute left.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is another reason I am glad that
                Mr&nbsp;McCartney has made this move. I adverted to it during
                the debate on the Second Reading of the Northern&nbsp;Ireland
                Bill, which took place in the House of Commons in July. If the
                issue of forming an Executive should arise without there having
                been a credible beginning to decommissioning, as required by the
                agreement, we would have to table a motion for the exclusion
                from office of those who had not begun the process of
                decommissioning. I am very pleased that Mr&nbsp;McCartney would
                now support us in such a situation. We welcome support from any
                source.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister (Designate) (Mr
                Mallon):</b> In spite of what some Members may think, I quite
                welcome the proposals in the motion and the amendments. Were I a
                Back-Bencher in the Assembly, I would have tabled something
                similar long ago because any political process — but
                especially one such as ours — must either go forward or go
                backward. You cannot stand still in politics. There is no
                statutory point where you can remain stationary without damaging
                the political process.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome this debate because it provides an
                opportunity for Members to voice their concern to get movement
                into the political process. I have no doubt that the process
                needs movement. It needs to be able to start to fulfil its
                obligations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For some time, as I think all Members know, I
                have been using every opportunity and every means at my disposal
                to warn of the damage being caused by non-implementation of the
                agreement. I do not wish to go back over the record, nor will I
                do so, but anyone involved or observing politics knows that I
                have tried to ensure that we have the structures and
                institutions to which we committed ourselves on Good Friday.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There were various reactions. Even parties
                that have been putting down amendments could not find time just
                to talk to us during the consultation process, to give us a
                simple proposal on departmental bodies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I can see that they might have ideological
                reasons for not making proposals on implementation bodies, or
                even co-operation bodies, but they could not even find time to
                give us a piece of paper on matters such as Departmental
                structures. That was their fault. It is interesting that one of
                the parties — or should I say one of the half-parties — that
                put down these amendments, could not find the time to give us
                one scrap of paper outlining their ideas on Northern Ireland
                Departments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I said, there have been various reactions
                to my approach. I was apparently trying to bounce people into
                things; I was accused of that recently. If trying to do what I
                have been obligated to by the electorate and by an election in
                this Assembly is bouncing, so be it: let me bounce.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have also been accused of grandstanding. I
                have been trying to come to some arrangement that all the
                political parties can agree to, that the Prime Minister, who is
                a signatory to this agreement, and the Irish Government, who is
                also a signatory, can agree to. If that is grandstanding, let me
                continue to grandstand.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was also accused of creating an atmosphere
                of crisis. I never used that term; I do not believe in that
                term. What I have consistently said — and I say it again —
                is that inertia in the political process leads to potential
                damage to the political process.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Heaven knows that this process is a tender
                enough plant without our damaging it ourselves. In the eyes of
                the electorate, it is being damaged in terms of its credibility
                on the ground and the confidence — or lack of it — that the
                political parties here have in it. I see that every day. I have
                contact with most of the parties. Some are difficult to find —
                and I am not talking about the Ulster Unionist Party with whom I
                seem to spend my time closeted. One might have to try to locate
                others in Boston, South Africa or various other parts of the
                globe, but when they do return, my door is always open, and
                suggestions will always be willingly received, with all the
                sincerity I can give them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have a problem with the amendments, not
                because I oppose them, but because there is a difference between
                a report and a proposal. I do not want to come back to the
                Assembly with a report — a piece of paper listing all the
                consultations we have had, all the things we have done and all
                the people we have spoken to. No, I want to come back, along
                with the First Minister (Designate), with a proposal that the
                number of Departments be X, that the Departments be A, B, C, D,
                E, F, G, H, I, J, K — or whatever — that the functions of
                each Department be clearly defined and that those in the
                Assembly who are against what is being proposed (and there will
                be opposition from Members) have an opportunity to table
                amendments, to challenge the proposals and subject them to
                debate. In that way, whatever is decided will have come out of
                the crucible of debate and will be all the stronger for that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not want a tidy little report, sneaked
                in before Christmas. That would not give us the opportunity to
                do all that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also want the opportunity to come back,
                with the First Minister, and present proposals for
                implementation bodies. I will start this today, but I am not
                going to relate that to the alphabet.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to justify those proposals. I want to
                give Members the opportunity to challenge them, to put down
                amendments, to vote against, vote for and speak their mind about
                them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to do likewise in respect of areas for
                enhanced co-operation as per the agreement and areas of
                co-operation, so that when we have finished, no Member will be
                able to say that the proposals have not been put through the
                democratic process in accordance with our Standing Orders.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some will agree, some will disagree, but
                everybody will be given the opportunity to table amendments. I
                would like to see this being done this week, but I make no
                predictions. Over the past two weeks, my confidence in making
                what I believe to be accurate predictions has been somewhat
                dented.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I believe it should be done this week, and
                that is why I find fault with the amendments — they lack
                imagination.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Why wait until Christmas week? What is wrong
                with this week? What is wrong with before Friday? What is wrong
                with the people who are putting down amendments instead of going
                at it with an almighty bash?</p>

                have charged the First Minister (Designate) and myself with
                doing it. They are right to tell us that it has not been done
                quickly enough, and I agree with them, but instead of churning
                out all the routine speeches about issues which are nothing to
                do with structures, they should speak their mind today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members who could not consult with us or
                submit their views in writing should tell us today what they
                think about the proposals for Departments and the implementation
                bodies. Perhaps the First Minister (Designate) and I will be
                able, as a result of your inspiration, Mr Initial Presiding
                Officer, to come back by 21 December — though preferably this
                week — and say &quot;Here are proposals. Pass them or reject
                them.&quot;</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I make no excuses for anybody — even the
                Chair. The time since 1&nbsp;July has been one of the most
                difficult periods in politics on this island. We have gone
                through a crucible in political life — from a Drumcree
                situation to an Omagh situation to a Ballymoney situation. For
                these reasons we should be inspired to move and create the
                structures and the institutions which are required. We owe it to
                ourselves, to those who elected us, and, indeed, in a strange
                way, to those who went to the trouble of putting down these

                That is understandable. It is also understandable that when

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr Ian Paisley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of course, in this House we do not have
                democracy. We heard the Deputy First Minister (Designate)
                talking about the crucible of debate. There is no real debate.
                We have a system of voting under which nothing can be passed
                except with a majority of Members on each side of the divide. It
                is easy for the Deputy First Minister (Designate) to say
                &quot;Put it to the vote.&quot; The vote is meaningless. It does
                not represent the ballot box or the number of people who voted
                to send representatives to this House, so that can easily be
                dismissed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The other point that needs to be dismissed,
                is the constant harping by some Members about how the people
                have spoken. The Northern Ireland Act 1998 contains over 400
                amendments that Members of the House of Commons were not given
                time to consider. Those were not in the agreement. It is not
                true to say that they were what the people voted for; they never
                saw those amendments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Sinn Féin/IRA spokesman spoke in this
                debate today. The people of Northern&nbsp;Ireland were no doubt
                listening to hear whether there was going to be some change in
                the attitude of the people that he speaks for. It is quite
                evident that there will be no change. I am reminded of a
                quotation in a book published after the Pope visited Drogheda.
                Sinn&nbsp;Féin answered the Pope as follows:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Force is by far the only means of
                removing the evil of the British presence in Ireland ... we know
                also that upon victory the Church would have no difficulty in
                recognising us.&quot;</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The IRA has not changed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We did not say that the IRA and Sinn&nbsp;Féin
                were inextricably linked. Those were the words of the then Prime
                Minister, Mr&nbsp;Major, and of the present Prime Minister, who
                repeated them. The Secretary of State, with whom all these
                people have a perpetual love-in, also repeated this in the
                House. When they go to Stormont House, let them argue with her.
                Do not let them come here and say &quot;We have no connection
                whatsoever with the IRA&quot;. What an abominable and atrocious
                lie.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Adams, who is not with us today, said that
                it would be intellectually and morally irresponsible to distance
                himself from the IRA, yet his spokesman in the House says,
                &quot;Oh, we are not associated with it at all, would not touch
                it with a barge pole,&quot; to quote the Deputy Leader of the
                UUP.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I understand that FAIT is a
                Government-sponsored body and that one of its leaders was an
                Alliance Party candidate who was not elected to the Assembly. It
                cannot be said that FAIT has any sympathy with the party that I
                lead, yet it has issued a report saying that those who have been
                released from prison are now engaged in this beating-up
                campaign. I asked the Prime Minister when he was here — he did
                not want to see me, and then decided that he had to see me for
                some reason best known to himself — &quot;How many released
                prisoners have been rearrested and put back in prison?&quot; He
                said &quot;I will find out.&quot; He wrote to me and told me
                that none had been.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">His answer is wrong. There are people who
                have been released and rearrested — back at the old game of
                violence and intimidation. A thousand children have been put
                through the crucible of intimidation.</p>

                the political conditions that allow us to move forward. In 1994
                the Progressive Unionist Party clearly stated that any citizen
                in possession of information relating to anti-social behaviour
                should report such information to the RUC. Party activists have
                worked with community representatives and the RUC to find
                solutions to this problem. The Progressive Unionist Party will

                parties that have signed up to the Good&nbsp;Friday Agreement,
                has pledged to use its influence to bring about decommissioning.
                That is exactly what we are doing. We believe that the full
                implementation of the Good&nbsp;Friday Agreement will bring

                in such a way.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Women’s Coalition agrees that there
                should be 10 Departments which must be tailored to meet the
                specific needs and the changing culture of society. Issues such
                as equality — and I am not talking just about gender equality
                — social inclusion, children, families, Europe, training,
                education and public health need to be given pride of place in
                these Departments — a new place in a new
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Also, we insisted that issues such as
                victims, reconciliation and the promotion of a culture of
                tolerance, which we cannot ignore, should be included in the
                agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have listened to the debates and
                negotiations on North/South bodies. These have been valuable,
                but we must remember that we are not creating anything new —
                all this has been done before in Europe. We believe in the value
                of North/South and East/West co-operation as a means of
                achieving greater economic and social cohesion on this island
                and between these islands. We want agreement on the North/South
                bodies, and we have been encouraged by movement in the past
                24&nbsp;hours.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, we want to underline the fact that
                the setting up of North/South bodies and structures is not the
                only way to achieving greater understanding between the people
                of this island. Co-operation at a social level should go hand in
                hand with economic co-operation. We want to see the creation of
                a North/South body which will encompass art, culture, heritage
                and language as one. To leave the Irish language in a body on
                its own would defeat the purpose of the exercise — encouraging
                North/South dialogue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Transport does not have to be dealt with in a
                North/South context, because such issues can be dealt with in an
                East/West one. We are talking about ports and air transport as
                well as about road and rail. To encourage understanding, greater
                effort should be put into the movement of workers, students,
                teachers and other people on this island. Examples of the work
                carried out by Co-operation North, the CBI and IBEC should be
                supported and enhanced.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those who fear a loss of identity as a result
                of a North/South structure should consider the Irish Congress of
                Trade Unions, which has been a North/South body for many years.
                The result has not made its Northern members any less Northern
                or its Southern members any less Southern.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I call on the Assembly to agree on
                North/South bodies and Departments before 21&nbsp;December and
                to form an executive. That is how we can all get what we want
                — violence and the threat of it off our streets for ever.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGimpsey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will not dwell on the issuing of reports
                and on the amendments from the Alliance Party. Suffice it to say
                that I agree with Mr&nbsp;Mallon’s comment that we are working
                to get agreements on outstanding areas. In my view, the sooner
                the better, and in my view the agreements should be in place
                before Christmas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That brings us to the next stage, which is

                no problems with his proposal. Part (c) of the motion could have
                been written by any Ulster Unionist. It is exactly what other
                members of my party and I have been saying for the past
                10&nbsp;months — despite the criticism of those Unionists who
                have been telling us &quot;No, that is nonsense.&quot; It is
                contained in the agreement, in paragraph 4 of the Declaration of

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The chapter on decommissioning recalls the
                provisions of paragraph 25 — the exclusion or removal of
                office clause. The agreement is quite clear. Decommissioning is
                inclusive and explicit and is a requirement of any Member who
                seeks to hold office in an Executive. It is in the agreement,
                chapter and verse.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are moving towards an agreement on strands
                one and two, and the question that will arise is whether Sinn
                Féin can take part. I have said publicly that Sinn Féin’s
                present position is one of self exclusion. It cannot retain the
                capacity to do 1,000&nbsp;Omaghs, in terms of a Semtex arsenal,
                and claim to be committed to democracy and non-violence. The
                holding of such an arsenal is a threat.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Decommissioning is an obligation under the
                agreement, and it is the demand of civic and democratic society.
                It is a sine qua non. Sinn Féin must have understood that when
                it supported the agreement, and must have realised that there
                would be calls for decommissioning. Under the agreement, the
                date for total disarmament is May&nbsp;2000. Not just Sinn Féin
                but the Provisional movement and Loyalists signed up to that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members are looking for a start date for
                decommissioning and a programme with a verifiable and credible
                beginning. However, Danny&nbsp;Morrison has said that the IRA
                will not give up the rust from a single gun. There is no way
                forward for anyone on that basis.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The armed struggle has failed, the central
                strategy of which was to make the cost of the Union so high that
                no British Government would be prepared to pay it. They imagined
                that in this way they could get rid of the British presence.
                This strategy ignores the fact that the British presence in
                Ireland is the Unionist community, the million-plus men and
                women living in the north-east corner of the island who hold
                themselves to be British. All the armed struggles in the world
                could not remove such a British presence. It seems that Sinn
                Féin is prepared, at least privately if not publicly, to
                recognise that.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The agreement contains a consent principle.
                The inhabitants of the island of Ireland are not a nation in the
                political sense. They are not now, never have been and probably
                never will be. Who says this? The people of the island say it.
                They agree that there are two political entities, which means
                that there is no right to national self-determination in terms
                of the entire population, no right to unity of the national
                territory, and no right to national self-government. The armed
                struggle has failed, and there is no logic in the maintenance of
                an arsenal of weapons. The Provisional IRA must have understood
                that when it moved forward on the agreement. It must have
                understood that it was signing up to decommissioning.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The hour is late but by no means too late. We
                are not quite ready for the appointed day — the transfer of
                powers. Once we get to that point, then we have the crunch.
                Unless there is movement from the Provisionals the question
                becomes: is the process to be destroyed because Sinn Féin will
                not honour its obligations or do we move forward without it?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have three options: to move forward with
                Sinn Féin and decommissioning; to wait until Sinn Féin is
                comfortable with the agreement and its obligations; to carry on
                without movement. The choice will come soon, and it is up to
                Sinn Féin. With all that has been invested in this process we
                cannot allow that irredentist group within the Provisional
                movement who insist on retaining its arsenal to bring the
                process down. The consequences do not bear thinking about.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not have a problem with
                Mr&nbsp;McCartney’s proposal; it is exactly what we have been
                saying for the past months — something, of course, that the
                members of the DUP deny. <i>[Interruption]</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If this is a sell-out and a betrayal why is
                the Member here? He is here because he has nowhere else to go.
                We are all in the same boat. We all have nowhere else to go.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The situation is that we can go forward with
                Sinn Féin and the Provisional movement or go forward without
                them, and the choice rests with the Provisional movement which
                should face up to its responsibilities.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Farren:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is an understandable sense of
                frustration, annoyance and perhaps even anger in the Assembly
                and beyond at the delay in reaching agreement on institutional
                aspects of the Good Friday Agreement. As one close to the
                negotiations over recent weeks, I would have preferred to have
                come here to contribute to a debate on the progress that had
                produced agreement. As in many situations when gaps are being
                closed, the remaining gaps become increasingly more difficult,
                and in our situation those gaps are informed by age-old fears
                and apprehensions. Hence our remaining difficulties. I am
                convinced, however, that the gaps can and will be closed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The opportunity given by today’s debate
                allows me to stand back from the immediate concerns of those
                negotiations and remind myself that what was achieved on Good
                Friday was a balanced agreement that took account of the
                aspirations and allegiances of our two communities. Hence the
                agreement’s effective recognition of the Nationalist community’s
                aspirations: that community’s identity and its desire to see
                closer relationships develop between the North and the South,
                especially through the North/South Ministerial Council.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Good Friday Agreement also recognised and
                respected the Unionist community’s allegiances and aspirations
                by giving practical expression to its desire for closer
                relationships between Northern Ireland and the rest of the
                United Kingdom through the British-Irish Council.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Crucially, the Good Friday Agreement
                enshrined the principle of consent as the only acceptable,
                democratic basis for constitutional change. The carefully
                constructed balance extends to the manner in which all the
                matters treated under &quot;confidence-building&quot; are to be
                advanced. They are not directed, and neither I nor my party
                interpret them as being directed, towards allaying the concerns
                of only one community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the question of institution building under
                the terms of the Good Friday Agreement, we must seek to progress
                in a way which continues to reflect that overall sense of
                equity. In particular, what we have been attempting to address
                in recent discussions on cross-border bodies is the creation of
                something for which there is no precedent. Hence some of the
                difficulties which have arisen.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We want to create a council which will be a
                political expression of the desire within the Nationalist
                community for a tangible link with the rest of the people of
                Ireland. It will also, in accordance with the Good Friday
                Agreement, provide initiatives for the mutual benefit of people
                in both parts of Ireland, and it is in this regard that it will
                probably be welcomed by others outside that tradition. Above
                all, it will allow, on a daily basis, the promotion of
                understanding and reconciliation between the hitherto divided
                people throughout this island.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Pursuing such ends, the council cannot, and
                will not, be a means of imposing change in violation of the
                principle of consent. We can, and must, deliver a package of
                implementation bodies and areas for enhanced North/South
                co-operation that will address real needs, and address them in a
                manner that will significantly contribute to the economic,
                social and cultural aspects of life in both parts of the island.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An endorsement of the emphasis on economic
                co-operation comes not just from the Social Democratic and
                Labour Party but from the wider community, and particularly from
                the business sector. These sources of support should allay the
                fears and concerns that others in the House may have about
                North/South implementation bodies. The Confederation of British
                Industry and IBEC have been referred to. They have made
                substantial contributions to economically directed initiatives
                under the remit of the North/South Council.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I recently addressed a major meeting convened
                by Chamberlink in County&nbsp;Monaghan. More than
                250&nbsp;representatives from chambers of commerce North and
                South came together to discuss how they might enhance their own
                and each other’s businesses. The message to me and Assemblyman
                Kennedy from the Ulster Unionist Party, who also addressed that
                meeting, was that we have to take initiatives, where it is in
                our remit to do so, that will address the need to promote
                North/South trade and trade beyond this island.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Last night’s ‘Belfast Telegraph’
                highlighted the contribution that has been made by one of our
                leading economists in this area and welcomed the prospect of the
                North/South Council’s providing enhanced co-operation on
                economic matters.</p>

                us. I refer in particular to the obligations on disarmament and
                decommissioning. In a previous debate, I said that I do not see
                decommissioning as merely a requirement of the Good Friday
                Agreement, and that those who currently possess arms and those
                who wield influence over them should regard decommissioning as
                an honourable and necessary contribution to the establishment of
                a lasting, peaceful democracy.</p>

                institutions, and begin to operate those institutions early in

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For the past few weeks the
                Prime&nbsp;Minister, Tony&nbsp;Blair, has been trying to
                jump-start the Belfast Agreement — if, indeed, it ever got off
                the ground. Tony&nbsp;Blair should have been made aware that, in
                developing a strategy for the future of Northern&nbsp;Ireland,
                we have had the benefit of much experience. Almost everything
                has been tried, at least once. He could now be forgiven for
                comparing the Belfast Agreement with the group that tried to set
                up a small, anarchist community, only to find that the people
                would not obey the rules.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister, David&nbsp;Trimble, finds
                himself in the same predicament. Having called for
                paramilitaries to disarm in his Nobel Peace Prize acceptance
                speech, he now finds himself between a rock and a hard place.
                The next day, the newly elected army council of the IRA ruled
                out demands for a handover of weapons. Mr Trimble must have felt
                that the bee of sorrow had stung his heart yet again — this is
                the third time this year that the IRA has dismissed calls for
                decommissioning, and Sinn&nbsp;Féin maintains that it is not in
                a position to deliver on arms.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Secretary of State, Mo&nbsp;Mowlam, has
                said that the political parties agree to all aspects of the
                Belfast Agreement — all, that is, except peace and goodwill to
                all men.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Trimble may take comfort in the
                knowledge that no one means all he says and that very few say
                all they mean. He should also remember the philosophy that</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;fear is the foundation of most

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">when deliberating on the allocation of
                ministerial positions. Will the First Minister confirm that no
                ministerial body will be appointed which includes Sinn Féin
                while the IRA maintains its stockpile of arms and explosives?
                Mr&nbsp;Trimble would do well to remember the words of
                Mr&nbsp;John&nbsp;Taylor, the then Home Affairs Minister, in
                December&nbsp;1972 when he warned</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Doherty:</p>
                </font></b><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Chathaoirligh, before referring to the Sinn
                Féin amendment, I want to pick up on a few comments that have
                been made by Members across the Floor.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;McCartney said that no mandate, no
                agreement and no Government can set aside democracy. That is
                complete gobbledegook. How does anyone receive a mandate except
                through the democratic process? How did the agreement, parts of
                which we are discussing, receive its endorsement? And how, other
                than through the democratic process, are Governments elected?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unionists in general are in danger of
                believing their own misinformed propaganda. For the record, I
                repeat what Mitchel&nbsp;McLaughlin said earlier: there is no
                such party as Sinn Féin/IRA.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a party known as Sinn&nbsp;Féin,
                which sought, and got, a democratic mandate in the Assembly
                election. Dr&nbsp;Paisley quoted from newspapers; he quoted
                amusingly from a book wherein he nearly got friendly with the
                Pope; and he quoted from an alleged IRA constitution. I suppose
                that he would know more about that than anyone else. The claim
                that Sinn Féin speaks for the IRA appears nowhere in any of our
                literature, and our constitution in particular. If any Members
                would like a copy, as they are given to quoting from
                constitutions, I will make one available. Sinn Féin speaks for
                Sinn Féin and for the people who vote for us. Unionism needs to
                abandon the negative mindset of continuous misinformation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To return to the motion before us, I noted
                Mr&nbsp;Trimble’s statement that it was &quot;not
                impossible&quot; that by 21&nbsp;December he could bring forward
                some sort of report. We do not want &quot;some sort of
                report&quot;. We want a final report, and we call upon the First
                Minister (Designate) and his Deputy to provide it, not later
                than 21&nbsp;December. Mr Mallon has said that it could be done
                in half a day, and I believe that. Mr Trimble said that he was
                negotiating until 11 o’clock last night, and I know that to be
                true, as some members of our delegation were here until
                11.20&nbsp;pm. The situation is agreed in principle; there are
                only the fine details to be worked out.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If Unionists have the political will, they
                can have closure on this issue in half a day. I urge them to
                show courage and get on with implementation of the agreement.
                They are fond of quoting paragraph&nbsp;25 and saying that it
                has to be supported. That is true, but paragraph 16 of strand
                one also has to be supported, as does paragraph 8 in strand two.
                Let me reiterate that Sinn Féin supports the agreement —
                every single paragraph. We do not support some parts of it and
                ignore others. We support all of it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recently Mr Trimble said that he — and I
                think he meant both himself and Unionism collectively — put a
                great price on the precise use of words. Sinn&nbsp;Féin also
                puts a great price on the precise use of words. There are no
                excuses left for Unionists to refuse to implement the agreement.
                They need political courage, vision and a sense of history. In
                this unique situation that has been created with the Belfast
                Agreement, they should have the courage to implement it. They
                have the authority to do so.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McFarland:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the light of the new relationship brought
                about by the agreement, I do not wish to unnecessarily annoy
                Sinn Féin, but I hope that this venture into reality will not
                elicit from the Member for North Belfast, Mr Kelly, another
                threat that the views of the Ulster Unionist Party might bring
                about a renewal of IRA violence. He, of course, uttered these
                words at the weekend.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I understood that the guns of the IRA were
                silent and that the IRA had joined the constitutional road that
                was the way forward. Surely the assurances of Sinn Féin as to
                the direction of the Republican movement cannot be worthless.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the early 1970s the IRA was in a mess,
                with individual battalions conducting unco-ordinated operations,
                and Sinn Féin was a Cinderella organisation with little
                direction. In the late 1970s the IRA reorganised into its cell
                structure. A strategy document, which was found by the Gárdaí
                in the Dublin flat of Seamus&nbsp;Twomey, the then IRA Chief of
                Staff, made it clear, as reported at the time, that</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Sinn Féin will come under the army at
                all levels&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The relationship between the two
                organisations was fairly clear at that stage. There followed the
                evolution of the Armalite-and-the-ballot-box strategy, with Sinn
                Féin moving onto the political stage that it occupies today
                while the IRA continued its terrorist campaign.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One has to be in awe of Sinn Féin at local
                government level. If someone in Turf Lodge gets a burst pipe he
                calls the Sinn Féin centre. Unlike the rest of us, who take a
                load of guff from the local plumber and wait about a week and a
                half to get something fixed, within half an hour the Turf Lodge
                plumber comes round and the pipe is fixed. How is it, I wonder,
                that Sinn Féin can have such influence with plumbers? The
                answer, of course, is that Sinn Féin and the IRA are — in the
                words of two successive Prime Ministers — &quot;inextricably
                linked&quot;.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sinn Féin claim that they are separate, but
                evidence of dual membership is piling up. Sinn Féin’s claims
                of not speaking for the IRA are ridiculous. The paramilitaries
                from all sides were involved in the talks quite clearly because
                it was understood that they were able to speak for their
                respective organisations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am encouraged to know that when discussions
                are taking place with key members of Sinn Féin they are, in
                reality, taking place with the IRA — straight from the horse’s
                mouth, from those who can produce the goods.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have some quiz questions for Members now.
                This came out of recent court cases and newspaper reports.
                Although Sinn Féin know the answers, they are not excluded as
                it is in the spirit of the agreement. Which two senior Sinn
                Féin Assembly Members left the IRA Army Council to go political
                but rushed back when they lost control to southern command,
                which bombed Canary Wharf? Which senior Sinn Féin Assembly
                Member was identified as the adjutant general of the IRA and
                army council member during the case which Thomas Murphy took
                against the ‘The Sunday Times’ in Dublin? Which senior Sinn
                Féin Member comes from the Belfast Brigade of the IRA and sits
                on the army council? I could go on, but the flavour of the
                relationship is plain to see.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was at the last three days of the talks,
                and it was quite clear to everyone there the spirit in which
                they were being conducted. It was clearly understood by the
                constitutional parties that decommissioning was a key part of
                that agreement. We were concerned that the words in the
                agreement were not strong enough, and we received written and
                verbal assurances from the Prime Minister that, in the spirit of
                the agreement, decommissioning would start in parallel with
                prisoner releases. On the basis of those assurances we signed up
                to it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Where are we now? In the last two or three
                weeks there has been an IRA convention. I see from yesterday
                morning’s ‘Irish News’ that the word on the street is that
                authority to take the decision on decommissioning was passed
                down to the seven-man army council. Therefore authority rests,
                one could argue, on Members of this House.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The IRA may need the space in which to sort
                out and convince its grass roots, and we are happy enough to
                give them that space. In the end the requirement of the people
                of Northern Ireland and the people of the island of Ireland for
                decommissioning must be met. We need to be realistic. The IRA
                must prepare for decommissioning. If responsibility for it has
                been moved down to the army council, if we can get our other
                structures sorted out in here, then the time must be right for
                decommissioning, and they really must get on with it.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many things have happened since this motion

                developments in his party. As Harold&nbsp;Wilson said,</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Delays in setting up the structures within
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland and between the North and the South are
                unacceptable. The fact that Mr&nbsp;McCartney chooses to exploit
                such disappointments should serve to warn of the dangers of
                further delay. Only those with a vested interest in destroying
                the Assembly benefit from such delays.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yesterday’s four-hour debate on the Health
                Service showed how urgent it is that we move on and serve the
                people who elected us. There are many other pressing issues
                relating to health and social services, education and training,
                economic development and tourism — to mention just a few —
                which require the involvement of Assembly Members at the
                earliest opportunity. The honeymoon period is over, and the hard
                work must begin.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members of the public are not impressed with
                Assembly parties which are bogged down in the past and afraid to
                move on and face the future. Let us stop exploiting the
                weaknesses in each other, because that only recoils on ourselves
                and leaves everyone worse off. The SDLP does not have these
                problems; it has been waiting, since the downfall of the
                power-sharing Executive of 1974, to begin the process of
                partnership government. It has been annoyed by the lack of
                progress and not impressed by those who gloat over the delays
                — and this motion clearly sets out to do that. However, as we
                debate the motion, the work is going on in this building, and
                success will come — perhaps sooner than our opponents believe.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sniping from the sidelines has been the
                favourite pastime of too many politicians in the past. Why do
                they do it? How many lives has it cost? Who has benefited?
                Certainly not the 71% who voted for the agreement and now feel
                very let down by the lack of vision and progress.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We can quote from the past. All of us can do
                that. Dr&nbsp;Paisley quoted from a book this morning, but what
                does it achieve? If I quoted what Dr&nbsp;Paisley said in the
                late 1970s, when he said that he would rather trust the devil
                than the RUC, would that achieve anything? Certainly not. If
                anyone doubts my word, let him go to the Assembly Library and
                check Hansard. But that is not why we are here.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One thing is sure: the past is the past and
                it is gone for ever. There is no going back. That simply is not
                an option — not now or at any time in the future. This time
                the wreckers and the begrudgers cannot win. Of that I am sure
                because slowly, but surely, there is a sense of community
                developing from the bottom up, and they know it. Much of this
                positive action has emerged gradually from economic regeneration
                groups, peace and reconciliation boards and a whole variety of
                community-based activity. We are in a much different position
                now than we were in 1974; there is a community out there solidly
                committed to backing the Assembly’s efforts to move forward.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many Members are involved in these
                activities, and they know that the day of the politician who
                thought for everyone and made all the decisions on his own,
                mostly to protect his own self-interests, is gone. People are no
                longer prepared to put up with the claptrap of mistrust and
                dissension. In such a world, arms and explosives, like the
                behaviour of failed politicians trapped in the past, become
                irrelevant. They do not count any more, and holding up the work
                of the Assembly over such an issue makes no sense at all.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In a new environment where there is
                developing trust, all guns will disappear, both mentally and in
                reality. In a new society built on partnership and trust there
                will be no place for weapons of war, no urge to feel the need to
                defend, because the greatest weapon of all is the ability to
                trust each other. To date, there has not been enough of that. We
                need to move forward, and we look forward to working with people
                in other parties who are as committed as we are to ensuring that
                the future is different from the past, that it is built on trust
                rather than fear, and offers hope rather than despair.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I believe that before this week is over,
                there will be agreement, and the people of Ireland — north and
                south — will be able to have the Christmas present they have
                all wanted for over 30 years. That is the real business of this
                Assembly. We are ready and willing to finish the business rather
                than waste time on motions which emphasise failure rather than
                hope for the future. Pantomimes belong to the schools and
                theatres outside — the Assembly is in the business of making
                this country work.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dodds:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to
                this debate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some of us were beginning to wonder when we
                would have the opportunity to debate such issues again, and it
                is no thanks to the initiative of either the First Minister
                (Designate) or his Deputy that this debate is taking place
                today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I congratulate all those responsible for
                ensuring that it is taking place. Members should have the
                opportunity to debate such crucial issues. I was perturbed to
                hear the First Minister (Designate) indicate that come the date
                specified — 18&nbsp;January&nbsp;— we may once again be
                listening to another interim report, although I noted the
                remarks of the Deputy First Minister (Designate), who was not
                looking forward to that prospect at all.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Amazement is added to my concern when I
                consider that Mr&nbsp;Taylor, as deputy leader of the UUP, has
                already said at a press conference that 10 Ministries have been
                agreed. I fail to understand, therefore, why we are not hearing
                details of that today. Mr&nbsp;McGimpsey said that we might have
                some agreement before Christmas, and I sincerely hope that if
                there is such an agreement, the Assembly will be reconvened to
                allow Members to debate these issues and consider them properly
                rather than having to wait until another day.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The main thrust of this proposal centres on
                the fundamental issue of decommissioning — an issue which has
                been fudged time and time again — and I am glad that we have
                the opportunity to debate it once more. It is a fundamental
                democratic pre-requisite that any party seeking to take part in
                the democratic process — never mind taking part in democratic
                government — should be completely committed to democratic,
                peaceful methods and should be prepared to give up weaponry,
                illegal armies and paramilitary gangs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are in this situation because during the
                talks process which led to the agreement and in the agreement
                itself the issue of decommissioning was never really grasped. It
                was fudged and put off to another day. The difficulties we are
                facing in getting others to move on that issue is the result of
                the fudging that has taken place in the past. Those who now
                demand the handover of weapons and were prepared to sit and
                negotiate with IRA/Sinn Féin whilst they held on to their
                weapons, are in a difficult position.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They say that it is essential — and I agree
                with this — that to be committed to an exclusively peaceful
                and democratic process means that there must be no weapons on
                the table, under the table, or outside the door. That was the
                same requirement for entry into the talks process to begin with,
                yet IRA/Sinn Féin were admitted into the talks process, were
                seated at the talks table, were allowed to complete the talks
                process, and not one Armalite or a single ounce of Semtex was
                handed over. That is why Members on these Benches lack
                credibility on the issue of decommissioning. The very demands
                they make now they previously made during the talks, and yet it
                was fudged, and IRA/Sinn Féin were admitted.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are told that decommissioning is an
                essential component of the talks and the peace process. The word
                &quot;essential&quot; is used but we never see any movement on
                the issue. Despite the concessions, the paramilitaries and their
                representatives are not even prepared to begin movement on what
                the people of Northern Ireland demand.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The DUP has been consistent and clear
                throughout. We do not rely on the Belfast Agreement, and those
                who use it as the basis for demanding decommissioning are
                relying on a false premise. It should demand that
                decommissioning begins before IRA/Sinn Féin get into
                government, and before terrorist prisoners are released. The
                tragedy is that the agreement does not demand such a move. I
                have read it carefully and it does not say, as was claimed in
                the debate, that decommissioning has to be completed within two
                years. It states that those who signed the agreement will</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;use any influence they may have to
                achieve the decommissioning of all paramilitary arms within two
                years&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I can almost hear the argument: &quot;We have
                used all the influence at our disposal and we will continue to
                do that ad infinitum.&quot; There is no demand in the agreement
                for the completion of decommissioning within two years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is the clear demand of democracy, and of
                the people of Northern Ireland, that those who want to gain
                positions in government and play a full role in the democratic
                process must be unarmed, and should not have at their backs
                those who are engaged in intimidation, racketeering or
                punishment beatings. It is also the demand of the Prime
                Minister. In Northern Ireland and in his own handwriting, he
                pledged to the people that terrorists and their frontmen would
                not benefit from the agreement unless violence was over forever,
                done with for good. It is the Government’s responsibility to
                see that Sinn Féin/IRA and others do not benefit from the
                agreement unless decommissioning is completed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The House has been lectured by Sinn Féin
                spokespersons about a new start, a new beginning, looking to the
                future, as if the arms issue applied only to the past. I remind
                the House that Mr Kearney, who was murdered in the New Lodge
                area in my constituency, died as a result of the use of IRA guns
                only a few months ago. Guns are still being used on the streets
                of Northern Ireland. They are not becoming irrelevant, they are
                being used to murder and inflict harm on people, and to exile
                and threaten them. Decommissioning cannot be put off. It has to
                be tackled now, and it has to be dealt with once and for all.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister (Designate) said that
                there had to be a credible beginning to decommissioning. Some
                Ulster Unionist spokespersons equate the commitment to</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;exclusively peaceful and democratic
                means&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">to the beginning of decommissioning. They
                have accepted that, when IRA/Sinn Féin begin to decommission,
                they will be committed to &quot;exclusively peaceful
                means&quot;. But it is about more than just beginning. It means
                the completion of decommissioning, giving up weapons in their
                entirety, the dismantling of terrorist organisations. I welcome
                the fact that there will be a united Unionist front on the
                motion. The Prime Minister and the Secretary of State have made
                it clear time and time again that the IRA and Sinn Féin are
                inextricably linked, yet paragraph c of the motion says</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;any party inextricably linked with a
                paramilitary organisation retaining arms cannot give a total and
                absolute commitment to exclusively democratic means&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has to be substantive and meaningful
                decommissioning, not a token gesture. However, I fear that we
                are being prepared for some sort of token gesture that will, in
                some way, allow movement.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.30 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The people of Northern Ireland, who have seen
                the release of over half the terrorist prisoners, who see the
                RUC under threat from paramilitary gangs whose organisations are
                still fully intact, are watching all these moves being made, and
                they will not be prepared to settle for some form of gesture.
                They want something substantial and meaningful which will show
                that people are divorcing themselves from violence and terrorist
                activity once and for all.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The DUP is happy to support the motion. I
                welcome the fact that the Unionist side will be presenting a
                united front and representing the clear demand from the people
                of Northern Ireland that the days of paramilitary organisations
                and those who believe in the use of force, be over. If they wish
                to reap the rewards of democracy, they must be fully committed
                to the means of democracy.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion before us today is an open attack
                on the Good Friday Agreement. The Member from North Down is
                trying to give the impression that he is attempting to move
                things on, but nothing could be further from the truth.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCartney is totally opposed to the
                agreement voted on last May. As soon as the parties came to an
                agreement, and even before the question was put to a referendum,
                he and his colleagues were out organising a series of public
                meetings to oppose it. This motion is part and parcel of that
                campaign.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;McCartney roundly criticised
                Sinn&nbsp;Féin when moving the motion this morning. It is clear
                that the motion is not directed solely at Sinn Féin. On the
                contrary, the motion is directed against all the parties who
                came together to seek progress and to find accommodation through
                dialogue. He is not trying to seek peace in the Six Counties, he
                is trying to put obstacles in the way of an accommodation and of
                real and lasting peace. Mr&nbsp;McCartney’s supporters have
                set their faces against equality, parity of esteem and the
                establishment of institutions in which we can all work together
                for the good of all our people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is in this context that we need to examine
                the motion. It is part and parcel of the attempt by the Leader
                of the UK Unionist Party — that is, if he still has a party
                — to retreat from the Good Friday Agreement and from the work
                of other parties who wish to find a lasting settlement. This
                motion is part of his fight against the agreement and, for that
                reason, I ask Members not to support it as it stands.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is essential that we work to put the
                institutions in place — the Executive, the all-Ireland bodies
                and the East-West dimension. That is the best way to bring about
                a new era for us all.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Sinn Féin amendment recognises the need
                for a report from the First and the Deputy First Ministers. The
                agreement clearly states that institutions will be put in place
                which are &quot;capable of exercising executive and legislative
                authority&quot;. But it is clear that some Members are not
                prepared to take the steps to see this through. That would
                entail co-operation, equality and inclusive structures in which
                there was a place for all.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We cannot turn back. We must go forward and
                continue the work to make equality a reality here in the Six
                Counties. We need to move forward with prisoner releases, with
                establishing a new police service and with a fundamental review
                of the justice system. We need agreement on all-Ireland bodies
                and the Departments now. Agreement on these matters should be a
                spur for us all to take the remaining steps to set up the
                Executive, the all-Ireland Ministerial Council and, through
                this, the implementation bodies. The majority of the parties
                supported the agreement and must stick to it now.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I ask the Assembly to support the amendment
                moved by Mitchel&nbsp;McLaughlin.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Close:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to make it clear that the
                Alliance Party tabled its amendments because it is a strong
                supporter of the Good Friday Agreement and because it is
                concerned at the delay in the full implementation of that
                agreement. Our action should not be construed or interpreted as
                putting a spanner in the works. Unlike the mover of the original
                motion, the Alliance Party does not wish to bring the Good
                Friday Agreement down; unlike the DUP it does not wish to wreck
                people’s hopes; and unlike Union First it is not being
                destructive. Rather, it wishes to operate, be constructive and
                be positive in its demand that all those who have responsibility
                move forward.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When people went to the polls on
                22&nbsp;May&nbsp;1998, they gave an overwhelming endorsement to
                the Good Friday Agreement. In our book, that was democracy. It
                was the voice of the people. That agreement was successfully
                negotiated by all those in the political parties who recognised
                that the only way to solve political disputes and differences
                was by negotiation and dialogue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yes, there are others who, recognising that
                their stance was unlikely to gain much support and having
                illustrated that they were either unwilling or unable to
                compromise, left the table. But in so doing, they exposed their
                weakness, their stubbornness and, yes, their intransigence.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important to note that the people have
                endorsed the agreement in full. They were asked a simple
                question:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Do you support the agreement reached in
                the multi-party talks on Northern Ireland and set out in Command
                Paper 3883?&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And the people said &quot;Yes&quot; —
                &quot;Yes&quot; to the parts they liked, and &quot;Yes&quot; to
                the parts with which they had difficulty. In so doing, they
                demonstrated their courage and hope for the future. They voted
                &quot;Yes&quot; to the Good Friday Agreement — not to the
                spins, not to the comments of others and not to other people’s
                handwritten notes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People are not stupid. They knew what they
                were doing, and they recognised that the agreement pointed a way
                forward based on compromise. They knew that it offered hope for
                the future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Having clearly and unambiguously voted
                &quot;Yes&quot; to the agreement, and having staked their claim
                and their future on that agreement, the people went to the polls
                once again and elected the Members of this Assembly. We are
                people whom they knew and some of whom they trusted to implement
                that agreement. They charged Members with putting in place the
                various parts of the agreement which they, the people, had
                endorsed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The people wished to see the positions of
                First&nbsp;Minister and Deputy&nbsp;First&nbsp;Minister put in
                place, and that has been achieved. But what has happened to the
                Executive, the various Committees, the Civic Forum, the
                cross-border bodies, the North/South Ministerial Council and the
                British-Irish Council?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The people did not vote for procrastination,
                for a renegotiation of the agreement, or for childish
                stubbornness; they voted for political action which would see
                the agreement implemented fully. Yet six months on, the people
                can ask with justification &quot;What has been done? Why have
                the posts of Ministers not been sorted out? Why is there no
                North/South Council? Where is the Civic Forum? Why are the old
                arguments and battles still being fought? Why is tribalism, as
                represented by Unionism and Nationalism, displaying the same old
                stubbornness as before?&quot; And they ask &quot;What has
                changed?&quot;</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The agreement’s Declaration of Support says</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;We must never forget those who have
                died or who have been injured, and their families. But we can
                best honour them through a fresh start, in which we firmly
                dedicate ourselves to the achievement of reconciliation,
                tolerance and mutual trust&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is this empty rhetoric? And let Members note
                the following:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;We pledge that we will, in good faith,
                work to ensure the success of each and every one of the
                arrangements to be established under this agreement.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is that, too, empty rhetoric?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mutual trust is in very short supply; good
                faith appears to be an aspiration; and as for tolerance, surely
                that means self-restraint, mildness and moderation. Those
                qualities have certainly been absent in any recent interviews I
                have seen and from some of the comments made earlier.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People are concerned about these matters, and
                those charged with responsibility have a duty to deal with those
                concerns. But people’s expectations do not end with the list
                that I have just outlined. They also expect to see an end to the
                violence that has destroyed so many lives.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.45 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They believed that the fresh start for which
                they voted meant a permanent end to death, destruction, threat
                and intimidation by terrorists. Here too, I regret to say, the
                people have been disappointed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The thugs and the gangsters are still using
                bullets; the hoods are still smashing skulls and bones; and the
                local mafia are still extorting money and controlling people in
                their neighbourhoods. The people want to break free. They want
                to live, work and play, free from stress and intimidation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Again, the people pose the question &quot;Was
                the Declaration of Support by all the participants to the
                agreement that they would oppose any use or threat of force just
                empty rhetoric?&quot; They ask &quot;Where is the evidence to
                suggest otherwise?&quot; Is it not a fact that the retention of
                illegal guns and explosives, irrespective of whether they are
                used, constitutes a threat against this entire community? It
                strikes me that too many Members of the House have been rather
                muted in their expressions of opposition to this threat.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The agreement was strongly recommended to the
                people, and they responded in an emphatic manner. All Members
                should now keep their side of the bargain. If some do not, they
                could be seen as hypocrites.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Christmas — the season of goodwill — is
                approaching. As the momentous year of 1998 draws to a close and
                a new year dawns, I appeal to the First Minister (Designate) and
                to the Deputy First Minister (Designate) to do what is
                necessary, in the spirit of goodwill, to reinvigorate the hope
                that was offered on Good Friday.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those Members who have influence with the
                paramilitaries should do what is necessary to have the threat
                that is represented by weapons and explosives removed. Give the
                people back their freedom and let them enter 1999 unburdened by
                the yoke of fear and intimidation.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Roche:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The pro-Union electorate in Northern Ireland
                is becoming increasingly aware of the extent to which the UUP
                negotiators conceded, given the terms of the Belfast Agreement,
                a form of government for Northern Ireland entirely incompatible
                with democratic practice and the rule of law.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The core point about the governance of
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland within the terms of the agreement is that
                the representatives of Republican terror can take seats in the
                Executive without the IRA’s ever decommissioning its terrorist
                arsenal. The position of the UUP negotiators, that the
                decommissioning of the terrorist arsenals is required by the
                section on decommissioning in the agreement and by the so-called
                Pledge of Office, is demonstrably false. The claims to the
                contrary made by the UUP negotiators mean that they are either
                trying to fool the pro-Union electorate or that they are so
                intellectually deficient that they do not understand the
                contents of the agreement they claim to have negotiated.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fact that actual decommissioning of the
                terrorist arsenals is not required by the agreement does not
                invalidate the demands of the pro-Union parties in the Assembly
                — all of them, I hope.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This demand is based on the imperatives of
                democracy and the rule of law. They are non-negotiable in any
                civilised society, and that is the basis of the UKUP demand for
                decommissioning.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The UKUP is committed to the imperative of
                what should properly be regarded as the surrender of terrorist
                arsenals, even if that means bringing the Assembly down. Whether
                or not the Assembly collapses, in the event of Unionists holding
                the line on decommissioning, is dependent upon the SDLP. The
                choice for the SDLP is simple: either it retains the current
                alignment of the party with Republican terrorism or it commits
                the party to democratic practice by demanding that terrorists
                give up their arsenals as a necessary condition for the
                formation of the Executive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unfortunately, it is unlikely that the SDLP
                will commit itself to the imperatives of democracy, and the
                reason for that is very simple. The intellectual incoherence of
                Irish Nationalism is such that only someone devoid of common
                sense would give two moments’ consideration to what even
                Mr&nbsp;Hume’s supporters refer to as his &quot;single
                transferable speech&quot; were it not backed by the cutting edge
                of Republican terror.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Hume’s commitment to the goal of a
                politically united Ireland, which he shares with the IRA, is
                such that, in the pursuit of this objective, he is prepared to
                give political respectability to Sinn&nbsp;Féin — a party
                which is an electoral threat to the SDLP. On this issue he seems
                to be blindly followed — never a commendable practice in
                politics — by the other members of the SDLP.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The moment of truth has arrived for
                Mr&nbsp;Hume and the SDLP. They have now to choose between the
                demands of democracy and the rule of law or support for
                terrorism. It is beyond belief that any party that designated
                itself &quot;democratic&quot; would demand a system of
                government in which the architects of terror for 30&nbsp;years
                would govern the people they terrorised while retaining their
                terrorist arsenals, while their most experienced and ruthless
                operators were released from prison and while the RUC was
                destroyed within the terms of reference in the agreement which
                will dictate the content of the Patten Report. It is beyond
                belief that a supposedly democratic party such as the SDLP would
                support a system of government designed to meet every
                requirement of a terrorist organisation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It beggars belief that the UUP negotiated
                such an agreement, but that is precisely what they did. It is
                obvious that the Leader of that party considered that what he
                had done was sufficiently worthy to merit his accepting the
                Nobel Peace Prize. Members of the UUP who did not participate in
                the negotiations have a significant choice to make — one that
                will determine whether Northern&nbsp;Ireland remains within the
                Union. It is in their power to ensure that a system of
                government, corrupt in its very design of appeasing terrorists,
                is never imposed on the decent, law-abiding pro-Union community
                of Northern&nbsp;Ireland. When that historic vote is presented
                to them they must act against the core requirements of the
                agreement negotiated by their leaders and vote in the interests
                of democracy and the preservation of the Union.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Weir:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In a rapidly changing political situation
                there were two statements this weekend which were depressingly
                familiar and depressingly predictable.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first was made on behalf of a terrorist
                organisation which indicated that it was not willing to give up
                terror. It wanted to retain its weaponry and to be able to use
                force and violence.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second was the response of Her Majesty’s
                Government which indicated that the terrorist organisation
                concerned posed no threat to peace. As the French would say,
                &quot;Plus ça change, plus c’est la même chose.&quot; For
                those who do not have schoolboy French, that means &quot;The
                more things change, the more they stay the same.&quot;</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I enthusiastically welcome this motion, not
                only because I have always been a supporter of Unionist unity
                — and this is a motion behind which I hope all Unionists can
                unite — but also because it is one which all true democrats
                should support, irrespective of whether they are &quot;Yes&quot;
                voters or &quot;No&quot; voters, Unionists or Nationalists.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I speak not for Union First but for democracy
                first. Democracy should be about the power of language; it
                should be about the power of persuasion, the power of ideas, not
                the power of one’s weaponry. There is a need in any society
                for democracy to ensure that those in government are truly and
                irrevocably committed to exclusively peaceful means. That is one
                of democracy’s demands. The key test for any party —
                Unionist or Nationalist, Loyalist or Republican — before
                entering government is whether that party is truly committed to
                democracy and exclusively peaceful means. If it is not, then it
                should have no place in the Government of Northern&nbsp;Ireland;
                that is not just a matter of principle, it is one of practical
                politics.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If terrorist organisations and front parties
                are allowed into government while still retaining the capability
                of inflicting terror on society, then government has a gun to
                its head. Whenever the demands of terrorism are turned down —
                whether on reform of the RUC, North/South relations or the
                so-called equality agenda — the implied threat is &quot;If we
                do not get what we want, we will go back to doing what we do
                best.&quot; That must be remembered. Decommissioning is not
                intended to humiliate any particular organisation, but it is a
                key element of the test to establish whether an organisation is
                truly committed to a democratic and peaceful way forward.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This has two implications. First, as the
                Member for North Belfast (Mr&nbsp;Dodds) has said, it is not
                sufficient for there to be only a start made on decommissioning.
                At the very least, substantial and ongoing decommissioning is
                needed before people can be considered as democrats. An IRA at
                99% or 95% of its efficiency would pose as big a threat to
                democracy as it does at present. The splinter group which caused
                the Omagh bomb was not a vast organisation with a huge amount of
                weaponry, but look at the level of destruction it achieved.
                Token decommissioning is not enough — at the very least it
                must be substantial and ongoing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are about one third of the way through the
                two-year process, so, at the very least, the IRA should be
                giving up one third of its weaponry. That is not too much to ask
                as a start. Or, as more than half of the prisoners have been
                released, perhaps the figure could be one half.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, while decommissioning is a step on
                the path to democracy, it is not a sufficient step. There are
                other ways in which the Republican movement and the Loyalists
                remain committed to a terrorist path. There has not been a
                declaration that the war is over. There was a statement from the
                Leader of Sinn Féin in the summer containing a vague aspiration
                that peace would be the way forward, but there has not been any
                statement from the IRA declaring an end to its war. We need to
                see that. We need to see an end to punishment beatings — these
                vile attacks carried out by paramilitaries so that they can
                control areas. Such activities are incompatible with being part
                of a democratic government. We need to see an end to criminal
                activity; we need to see the paramilitary organisations get off
                people’s backs; we need to see a start being made to
                disbanding the terrorist organisations. Why do we need armies in
                waiting if these people are committed to peace? Finally, we need
                to see a return of the bodies of the disappeared.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is clear that an organisation which
                retains its weaponry is not a suitable candidate for government.
                Equally, a Government Minister, backed up by a private army, or
                a private police force or a private mafia, should not be
                permitted within a democratic society. Much movement is
                therefore required before any of the organisations can qualify
                as democrats, let alone be worthy to be in the Government of
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I remain very sceptical about whether Sinn
                Féin/IRA, the organisation most likely to aspire to a place in
                Government, will make that transition.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In these circumstances, responsibility rests
                with Her Majesty’s Government and with the SDLP. It is time
                that Mr&nbsp;Blair honoured the pledges which he gave to the
                people of Northern&nbsp;Ireland. We can move on without
                Sinn&nbsp;Féin to ensure that those who are not committed to a
                peaceful way forward are excluded from Government. There should
                also be an end to the release of prisoners while there is no
                decommissioning.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is an onus on the SDLP to join with the
                other democrats in the House and leave behind those who have not
                abandoned terrorism. The only way forward is for democrats to
                work together, and that is the only solution acceptable to the
                people of Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion enthusiastically.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Haughey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It takes a fairly spectacular kind of brass
                neck to accuse the SDLP, as Mr&nbsp;Roche of the UKUP did, of
                incoherence, given the events of the last 48&nbsp;hours.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those who believed that what we were engaged
                in was a tidy, predictable process governed by timetables and
                rules and observing strict procedures seem to understand little
                about politics, or about human nature. We live in an extremely
                volatile community — a conflict-ridden mess. To a greater or
                lesser extent, all of us have contributed to that mess, either
                through what we have said, or not said, either through what we
                have done, or not done, or through the attitudes that we have
                adopted. I am amazed that there are people who seem to believe
                that, somewhere in the firmament, there are vast, immutable
                truths and principles of which they, alone, are the guardians.
                They seem to be oblivious to the fact that debate, arguments and
                conflict on these matters have been part of human experience
                since the earliest times.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This process is as imperfect as the people
                who are involved in it, and, indeed, as imperfect as those who
                are not involved in it. It is as imperfect as any political
                process. Even so, we have made a great deal of progress. There
                are people in the House today who, a relatively short time ago,
                took the view that politics was futile and that the only way to
                solve the problems of this society was through the use of force.
                The political organisations associated with that attitude have
                now renounced it and are involved in the political process. I
                call that progress.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are few people in the House who will
                not be able to recall, as I can, the occasions in the past when
                our telephones would ring in the early hours of the morning, and
                we knew that we were going to get the news that someone had been
                killed. We would always pray that the violence would not be that
                bad, that it would not have caused someone’s death, but we
                remember the many occasions when the violence did cause
                fatalities, sometimes multiple fatalities. Let us be thankful
                that those days are gone.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is not to say that there are no violent
                deaths or no violence in this society. Anyone who thought there
                would be a sudden end to a conflict which had lasted for
                centuries was either foolish or tragic. Conflict has declined,
                and our collective responsibility is to try to reduce it
                further, and to find ways and means of co-operating with each
                other to advance the interests of the electorate. We have a
                collective responsibility to make the agreement work. I firmly
                believe that the vast majority of people on this island want us
                to do that. The result of the referendum is evidence of that.
                The electorate does not want us to engage in some of the cruel
                slagging, sniggering and jeering that occasionally goes on in
                the House.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While this process, like any other political
                process, is flawed and untidy, with ragged edges, our job is to
                make it work. If we are to do so, a certain amount of forward
                movement is necessary. We always found that when politicians do
                not give a lead, the political vacuum is filled with violence,
                and we are coming close to the end of the time that is available
                for producing the necessary forward movement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Colleague Seamus Mallon, the Deputy First
                Minister (Designate) said this morning that we cannot stand
                still because that would damage the political process. Since
                April, we have stood still in political terms, and have taken
                great risks with the integrity of the political process in which
                we are involved.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I understand to some extent the impatience
                which led to the motion and the amendments. We are impatient
                too. We want forward movement. We have tried repeatedly and
                consistently in recent weeks to produce such momentum, and we
                will continue trying until we reach agreement. But it should be
                obvious that agreement is possible only if both sides are
                prepared to shift their positions, to be flexible and to seek
                accommodation — and not to stick to rigid party positions. It
                should be obvious that pronouncements such as &quot;This is our
                bottom line; we can go no further&quot; and refusing to examine
                alternatives, are not the way to get agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must begin work on the North/South bodies
                and the Executive structures, and begin to tackle day-to-day
                issues relating to the Health Service, and our schools, which is
                what we were elected to do.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev William McCrea:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the opportunity to speak in a
                forthright debate which is very relevant to our country at
                present.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My party recalled the Assembly to debate the
                pigs issue. We could have had a full day’s debate then on
                general agricultural issues, but when we sought the agreement of
                the Social Democratic and Labour Party and Sinn Féin in the
                relevant Committee, we were blocked because those parties did
                not see that as relevant to their progress.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today’s debate is an acknowledgement of the
                reality of the situation. The motion notes</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;a. no proposals have yet been made
                under paragraph 16 of strand one of the Belfast Agreement have
                yet been made,</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">b. actions since are set out in paragraph 8
                of strand two of the Belfast Agreement have not been
                achieved&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will come to paragraph c later.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have listened to the debate so far and have
                noted some of the remarks that have been made. The Member for
                Lagan Valley (Mr&nbsp;Close) said that the people voted for the
                Belfast Agreement. The majority of those people did not know
                about the 440&nbsp;amendments that would be made to that Bill.
                How can anyone say that this is what the people voted for, when
                even the Government did not know what it was suggesting?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I say to Mr Close and to this House that
                while there are those who boast about their &quot;Yes&quot;
                position, I am proud to say that I went to the people of Ulster
                with a &quot;No&quot; position. When I see terrorists walking
                the street, and when I see the RUC being dismantled, I thank God
                that my finger was not in that pie. I was not a part of that
                treachery, and I was not a part of the betrayal of those people.
                My Colleagues and I were commissioned to oppose that act of
                treachery, and we are doing exactly that. No one need be
                surprised that we have honoured our election pledges while so
                many others have failed to fulfil theirs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several Members have expressed their
                frustration. Mr&nbsp;Haughey and Mr&nbsp;Mallon were quite open
                about that. Mr&nbsp;Mallon cannot wait to get his hands on
                power. He cannot wait to get himself and his Colleagues in Sinn
                Féin into positions of power. The Member for East Londonderry
                said that he had been waiting for this since 1974. Between 1974
                and 1998 we have had a blood-curdling, murderous attack on the
                law-abiding people of this country. Mr&nbsp;Haughey talked about
                waiting for the telephone call. Many of us in the Unionist
                community know exactly what it is like to wait for the telephone
                call, wondering whether relatives have been murdered. Many
                attempts were made to murder our relatives over those years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us not pretend that nothing has been
                happening. Much has happened since the signing of the agreement.
                The Sinn Féin Member for Mid Ulster warned us that if his
                political strategy did not work, he and his colleagues would go
                back to what they know best, meaning of course the Armalite. It
                was a former member of that party from the same constituency who
                said that the strategy of Sinn Féin was &quot;The Armalite in
                one hand and the ballot box in the other&quot;. We know the
                background of the Sinn Féin Members.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have been lectured about a new beginning
                and told that we are enjoying the fruits of peace. What kind of
                peace are we enjoying? In this morning’s newspaper there is an
                article entitled &quot;The toll of Ulster’s young
                victims&quot;. Here are the fruits of peace. More than 1,000
                Ulster children have been murdered, beaten, intimidated or
                exiled by terrorists this year, according to Families Against
                Intimidation and Terror. Those are the fruits of peace. We have
                heard that in November alone there were 420&nbsp;recorded
                terrorist incidents. Nine people were exiled, 67 intimidated,
                two shootings and seven beatings were carried out, and so forth.
                That is the kind of peace that we are talking about. This is the
                fruit of the hard labour of the Belfast Agreement, and it does
                not end there.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Terrorists are walking the streets, snubbing
                their noses at those who have been murdered. In the very
                meetings which have been discussing the disbandment of the
                police, the murderers were laughing at the widows of their
                victims. I make no apology for describing the terrorists who do
                that as being no better than scum, and they have no part to play
                in the future of this Province. We have to defeat the terrorists
                in our midst, but under this agreement the terrorists have been
                released.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We had a lecture about equality. It is
                amazing how some Sinn Féin members have the gall to talk about
                equality. One might have expected that after the release of 214
                terrorists half of the guns and explosives would be handed over,
                but that is not in the equation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">IRA/Sinn Féin sit there smugly. They may
                fool some people (those who think that they should be brought
                into government), but so far as the DUP is concerned, IRA/Sinn
                Féin represent a group of people that needs to be defeated —
                not cuddled up to, not appeased, and not allowed to become part
                of any Administration. The DUP will not be aiding or abetting
                any agreement that puts IRA/Sinn Féin into any future
                Government of this country.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On 5 December a demonstration — with full
                paramilitary regalia — was held in Dungannon in support of
                disbanding the RUC. Some people who took part in the parade wore
                full combat uniform and boots, and the ordinary people of
                Dungannon were subjected to verbal abuse. That is the kind of
                treatment we are being asked to accept in this country. Such is
                the fruit of a peace process. We are being subjected to
                mafia-type threats, extortion and drug-related incidents.
                Orangemen are still at Drumcree, but this rabble is allowed to
                walk the streets of Dungannon and abuse the people who live
                there. The number of troops has been reduced, routine military
                patrols have ceased, and so on.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">IRA/Sinn Féin have no intention of
                disarming. Their present strategy in the political arena will
                take them so far, but when it can take them no further they will
                go back to doing what they do best. We have stood against all
                their threats and intimidation for the past 30 years. We have
                never knuckled under them, and, by the grace of God, we never
                will. We will see them defeated.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The lecture we had about there being no link
                between the IRA and Sinn Féin was very interesting.
                Martin&nbsp;McGuinness was convicted of IRA membership in 1974
                and was jailed for 12&nbsp;months in the Republic of Ireland. He
                told the court there that he was very proud to be an IRA
                commander in Londonderry.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What about Kelly? In 1973 he was convicted of
                IRA membership and of inciting others to join. What about
                Gerry&nbsp;Kelly? He masterminded the IRA’s Old Bailey
                bombing.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What about Gerry&nbsp;Kelly? Yes, we heard
                the litany when they were trying to tell us that there was no
                connection, that they were not a part of IRA/Sinn Féin, that
                there is no such thing as IRA/Sinn Féin. Whom do they think
                they are fooling? So far as we are concerned, and so far as the
                Government are concerned, they are two sides of the same coin
                — Gerry&nbsp;Adams and all the rest of them. I could go on,
                taking them one by one.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a challenge to the DUP to galvanise
                the pro-Union opposition to the current policy of treachery.
                There is a challenge to Ulster Unionists: will they let Sinn
                Féin into government? There is a challenge to the SDLP: will
                they go on without their Sinn Féin? There is a challenge to the
                Government: now is the time to stop appeasing terrorism and
                defeat it.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Douglas:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Trimble is on record as saying that,
                to make the Assembly work, it is essential that all participants
                be committed to peaceful and non-violent means. The Prime
                Minister is on record as saying that legislation will be
                introduced to deal with prisoner issues and with parties that
                are linked to paramilitary organisations. Mr&nbsp;Trimble also
                said that the UUP would hold Mr&nbsp;Blair to his promises, and
                would not sit in the Government of Northern&nbsp;Ireland with
                unreconstructed terrorists. He also said that this issue must be
                comprehensively addressed to our satisfaction. Paramilitary
                organisations must decide that the war is over, dismantle,
                disarm and stop the beatings.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since the so-called ceasefire, there have
                been 450 beatings and murders. IRA/Sinn&nbsp;Féin have so far
                refused to disarm or to endorse the exclusively peaceful and
                democratic measures laid down in the Mitchell principles. For
                those of us who opposed the Belfast Agreement, it was no
                surprise when IRA/Sinn&nbsp;Féin said at the weekend that they
                would not give up a single bullet or one ounce of Semtex.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Neither was it a surprise when we heard that
                the Ulster Unionists, the SDLP, the Alliance Party and the Women’s
                Coalition are still in talks with Republican and Loyalist
                murderers. As we know, they have broken their promises to the
                electorate many times before.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Loyalists were bought off by the Government
                when they were promised that prisoners would be released. The
                Government have also been bought off by IRA/Sinn&nbsp;Féin with
                the release of many savage murderers; the promise of ministerial
                positions in the New Assembly; the promise that many border
                checkpoints and posts would be removed and that all-Ireland
                bodies with executive powers would be set up; the promise that
                the Loyal Orders would be constrained by the Parades Commission;
                and the promise that the RUC would be reformed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In return for those promises, IRA/Sinn&nbsp;Féin
                declared a ceasefire — such as it is — and told the
                Government that there would be no more bombs on the mainland,
                provided their requests are granted. Otherwise, they will do as
                they have done in the past — blow another town to pieces or
                murder a few more members of the security forces.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is unbelievable that some Members who call
                themselves Unionists are prepared to go down the road of this
                corrupt process. It is also difficult to understand why those in
                the SDLP who call themselves democrats are prepared to support
                cohorts who have been responsible for many dire atrocities. It
                is also difficult to understand why they have not, at any time,
                used their position to encourage decommissioning. I suppose it
                is because their ultimate goal is the same, and they are
                prepared to accept anything to further their aim.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is time for the Assembly to insist on
                decommissioning. Unreconstructed terrorists should not be in
                Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has recently been much use of the word
                &quot;equality&quot;. As British citizens, we demand equality of
                treatment, and reject this façade with the enemies of Northern
                Ireland. I support the motion.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Nesbitt:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The theme of the speeches by Mr&nbsp;Neeson,
                Mr&nbsp;Haughey and the Deputy First Minister (Designate) was
                that people are despairing because we are not reaching agreement
                quickly enough. It is better to take a little longer over the
                agreement and get it right than to rush it and get it wrong. It
                is as simple as that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Where I live is part of the United Kingdom.
                Scotland had its referendum many months before ours; we had ours
                in May. If or when, and I believe it will be when, we move to
                full devolution next May, we will still be doing that ahead of
                Scotland. So we are moving at a reasonably rapid pace in
                comparison with other parts of the United Kingdom, and we have
                been having these discussions and debates against a backcloth of
                30&nbsp;years of violence which neither Scotland, nor Wales has
                had. That may be the pragmatic way of putting it, but the party
                I represent also reflects the agreement in full.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I note from the motion that paragraph 16 of
                strand one refers to Ministers and then, following that, to the
                Executive. The word &quot;follow&quot; does not imply immediacy,
                but the word &quot;after&quot; is implied. No one has so far
                referred this morning to paragraph 35 of strand one of the
                agreement, and it is the heading of that paragraph that
                indicates the mode that we are in at the moment — the
                transition mode. Under the heading &quot;Transitional
                Arrangements&quot; paragraph 35 talks about Standing Orders
                (which we are working on), about working practices and about
                preparations for the effective functioning of the Assembly. That
                is what we are about. Let us get it right, even if it takes a
                little longer, rather than rush and get it wrong. That is my
                first point.</p>

                Féin/IRA — it refers to inextricable linkages. I have said
                this before and now I will say it again: a man and a woman are
                two separate individuals, but when they are married they become
                inextricably linked. It is to such an inextricable linkage that

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mitchel&nbsp;McLaughlin asked why we should
                fear peace. I do not fear peace. Indeed, I wish for peace. But
                what we have at the moment is not peace. We have the absence of
                the violence of the ‘70s; we have a mere ceasefire. I remind
                Sinn Féin that ‘The Irish Times’— not I — said quite
                rightly that there is an obligation on the part of Sinn Féin to
                deliver its part of the bargain. Fergus&nbsp;Finlay, the mentor
                of the Tánaiste, Dick&nbsp;Spring, when he was in that
                position, also said the same at that time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The ‘Belfast Telegraph’ used two words
                which are very salutary for us all with reference to the IRA.
                The editorial said that it was a &quot;threat
                undiminished&quot;. A threat undiminished does not give us a
                peaceful environment. I wish for peace; I do not fear it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I say to Members opposite, and to Sinn Féin
                in particular, that I do not fear equality. However, equality is
                not what Sinn Féin may wish it to be. The 40 nations of the
                Council of Europe have defined quality. The Forum for Peace and
                Reconciliation in Dublin said that we, as individuals, cannot
                pick and choose but must reflect the international consensus
                regarding matters of state. This refers to equality as
                &quot;participation within the state&quot;.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those in a state who wish to be linked to
                another one cannot interfere with territorial integrity and
                sovereignty. That cannot be said of Sinn Féin or of its
                equality agenda. A fundamental principle of international law
                and practice is that the territorial integrity of states is
                recognised and that co-operation is built from within a state.
                That principle is not being recognised.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sinn Féin says that the agreement is merely
                transitory, a staging post. Others say &quot;We must go much
                further.&quot;</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This has been a useful debate. When the
                possibility for such a debate was discussed some weeks ago many
                parties favoured an opportunity to air and share views and
                concerns about the formation of government departments,
                North/South co-operation and implementation bodies, the
                British-Irish Council and the consultative Civic Forum. It was
                those four areas which, on 1&nbsp;July, the Assembly asked the
                First Minister (Designate) and Deputy First Minister (Designate)
                to consider.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I pointed out on 1 July, when speaking in
                support of the nominations of Mr&nbsp;Trimble and Mr&nbsp;Mallon,
                that the issue of decommissioning does not relate to any of the
                functions or responsibilities of the First Minister (Designate)
                or Deputy First Minister (Designate). This also applies to the
                issues of prisoner releases and the Police Commission. The
                responsibility of the First Minister (Designate) and Deputy
                First Minister (Designate) is to lead Members on those aspects
                of the agreement which fall to the Assembly, either through the
                Assembly itself or by agreed mechanisms for relationships within
                the British/Irish or North/South framework.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister (Designate) has
                spoken of his frustrations that he and the First Minister
                (Designate) have not yet been able to discharge those
                responsibilities. They will still not be able to discharge their
                responsibilities if Members leave today thinking that we can
                still keep kicking all those issues in front of us. We cannot
                continue to do that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The vexed question of decommissioning cannot
                be resolved this week. Parties have different stances on and
                interpretations of that issue. Members may feel that one party
                or another is misguided in its interpretation either of the
                issue or of the agreement. The Assembly can stop the issue of
                decommissioning being a deadlock by agreeing the new government
                departments, the initial tranche of North/South implementation
                bodies and areas for North/South co-operation, so enabling the
                necessary legislation and personnel arrangements to be put in
                place.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Over the last few weeks we have been trying
                to make progress — at least in those areas which will take
                time to develop further — without becoming caught up in a
                rhetorical shoot-out over decommissioning. Unfortunately, this
                debate has tended to be more about decommissioning than the
                issues which should have been before the Assembly — proposals
                and suggestions on new government departments, the initial areas
                for North/South co-operation and implementation bodies, the
                consultative Civic Forum and the Assembly’s contribution to
                the British-Irish Council. That still has to be done.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Nesbitt said that although the referendum
                in Scotland was held prior to the referendum in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland less progress has been made there.
                Scotland has not yet elected its Parliament and does not have
                the salaries, allowances and running costs to pay. The Scottish
                people would be pretty angry if their elected Parliament could
                not sort out its government departments or determine its
                relationships with other bodies after six months. The comparison
                does not stand up. The context is different.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is another reason for us to be more
                diligent and act more urgently here. The situation I have
                outlined is not the only difference between Northern Ireland and
                Scotland. Political inertia is less affordable in Northern
                Ireland. One of my fears about the Forum was that it would be a
                case of salaried intransigence. We seem to be in a form of
                salaried inertia and more urgency is required.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some deadlines were in the agreement. The
                deadline of 31&nbsp;October was there with regard to the
                North/South bodies and the North/South work programme. That
                deadline assumed that Government Departments would be organised
                and formed and that a shadow Executive would be up and running
                some time before that. That was the presumption at the time of
                the agreement, and it was there because that was the Ulster
                Unionists’ negotiating position in the talks. They told us
                that they could not agree North/South bodies in the
                negotiations, that these had to be worked out as part of the
                working of the new arrangements. They said that the new
                Departments had to be up and running with shadow Ministers in
                place, reporting to the Assembly on the areas which had been
                agreed with the Irish Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is the way the Ulster Unionists said it
                had to happen, but they have reversed their negotiating
                position. Before they engage in any further discussion on new
                Government Departments in Northern Ireland, they want to sort
                out and limit the North/South bodies. David&nbsp;Trimble, quite
                rightly, talks about the importance of consistency and clarity
                in other places. I would ask him, and his party, for the same
                approach in the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today UUP Members have lectured the SDLP on
                its responsibilities in the current situation and have expressed
                disappointment about what they perceive as a lack of support for
                their position in some matters. I am dismayed that there seems
                to be a change in their position. If this Assembly is to have
                any credibility, we must make progress on these issues. The
                public should have the confidence that their will will prevail
                and that the whole thing will not disintegrate when the parties
                push their own mandates.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In order for the agreement to work, we must
                make arrangements for the new Departments and for the
                North/South bodies. The agreement also has to work in all other
                aspects and, whether people like it or not, that includes
                prisoner releases. No one can make preconditions. Whether we
                like it or not, the work of the Independent Commission on
                Policing will be part of the success of this agreement. There
                must also be real progress on decommissioning.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mitchel&nbsp;McLaughlin said that Sinn&nbsp;Féin
                wants to see the gun removed. Other people who have put the case
                for decommissioning want to see the gun removed, but it has to
                be something that is visible. Sinn&nbsp;Féin, in its own terms
                and in its own time, has always insisted that it does not want
                anything implicit or anything under the table. Everything has to
                be upfront, visible and obvious — something that it could take
                to its constituency. That was the case during the negotiations
                with regard to prisoner releases, the need for movement on
                policing and a variety of other issues. It said that these were
                not negative demands to get what it could from the first
                &quot;takings&quot; of the agreement, rather it was to enable
                Sinn Féin to go to the constituency and assure people that
                there was something real for them in this agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The same case can be made for disarmament. We
                should not hear it continually dismissed as a red herring. The
                more it is dismissed, the more people become preoccupied with
                the issue. Let us all move on and help each other. The First and
                Deputy First Ministers should be able to put forward some
                practical proposals without the matter being confused or
                complicated by other party issues.</p>

                we hand to Sinn Féin the Christmas box of a place in the
                Government of Northern Ireland while it retains its guns or do
                we, as democrats, deny it that place until it proves that it has
                the same democratic credentials as the rest of the parties in
                this Chamber?</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.45 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The debate has to focus on Sinn Féin. No
                matter whether one looks at its members’ statements, at the
                constitution of the terrorist organisation which it represents,
                or at the connections of its Assembly Members, there is no
                mistaking the fact that the full spectrum of terrorist activity
                is represented in the form of IRA/Sinn Féin in this Chamber.
                Whether one speaks about bombings, extortion, the organising of
                mass murder in this city, or any other line of terrorist
                activity, we will find in that party someone who not only
                epitomises the type of person who is engaged in one of those
                activities, but a person who has engaged in one of them. Should
                we allow such people into the Government of Northern Ireland?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is worth focussing Members’ attention on
                these pertinent matters, and I want to look at some of the
                arguments of the parties who oppose Mr&nbsp;McCartney’s
                motion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was slightly perturbed to hear the First
                Minister (Designate) say &quot;Let us not forget that it is not
                just the electoral mandate which entitles people to a place in
                the Government; it is also the fact that they are committed to
                democratic and peaceful means.&quot; I hope that is not the
                loophole that he intends to use to push matters forward, as
                others are exhorting him to do.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have been on Belfast City Council since
                1989 when legislation was introduced requiring members of all
                parties to sign an agreement saying that they were committed to
                democratic and peaceful means. I have since seen Sinn Féin
                members get elected and sign that agreement, and then in the
                council chamber defend the economic warfare to which Belfast has
                been submitted by the IRA. I have heard them defend the
                so-called punishment beatings or refuse to condemn them after
                signing a bit of paper by which they are regarded as democrats.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us look at some of the other Members’
                contributions. As I listened to Mr&nbsp;Neeson I was reminded of
                a comment by someone in another place, who said that if he
                intended to divorce his wife, he would hire one of the young
                lawyers in the Alliance Party to represent her. I thought for
                one moment that the famed open-mindedness of the Alliance Party
                was beginning to bear fruit when Mr&nbsp;Neeson said, in his
                strongest voice, that 1,000&nbsp;children had suffered from
                human rights abuses, and that that was unacceptable. He went on
                to say that the Mitchell principles had been diluted so that a
                coach and horses could be driven through them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In much more colourful language, his
                Colleague described how people’s bones were being broken and
                money was being extorted. At this stage I thought that this was
                a fiendish plot, that the Alliance Party was going to back
                Mr&nbsp;McCartney’s motion. But, having said all that, they
                came to what conclusion? By 21&nbsp;December the First and
                Deputy First Ministers (Designate) should bring a final report
                before the Assembly. The implication of that conclusion is that
                it sets in train the process which will allow the very people
                who are breaking bones, extorting money and engaging in human
                rights abuses, to occupy positions in the Government of Northern
                Ireland. It is not a case of sitting on the fence — they are
                becoming the fence.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We then heard Sinn Féin’s arguments.
                Mr&nbsp;McLaughlin told us that Sinn Féin and the IRA have
                nothing to do with each other — and we all believe that. <i>[Laughter]</i>
                He went on to explain why that is so. He said that Sinn Féin
                does not believe in or support punishment beatings. Such a claim
                is a bit odd. I have been in a council chamber when Sinn Féin
                opposed a motion condemning punishment beatings. But Sinn Féin
                — the master of words — gets round that. It gets round it by
                referring to such incidents as community corrections — not
                punishment beatings.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Then we were told that Sinn Féin wants to
                see the gun removed forever. Mr&nbsp;McFarland quoted
                Gerry&nbsp;Kelly, who, of course, does not speak for the IRA.
                They are not inextricably linked — in fact, they have nothing
                to do with each other. Gerry Kelly said that if Unionists keep
                on talking about getting rid of guns the IRA will go back on the
                streets.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But Sinn Féin’s most conclusive argument
                is that nowhere in its election literature or its constitution
                is there a claim that it speaks for the IRA. Of course, Sinn
                Féin would not include that in its election literature. Why
                would it? And by using all of these arguments, Sinn Féin
                expects us to believe that its members are house-trained
                democrats who are fit to fill places in government. So far as
                the Democratic Unionist Party is concerned, Sinn Féiners are
                not fit to come through the doors of this Chamber, let alone
                take places in government. And it does not really matter how
                people try to paint them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The same theme of support has been running
                through all of the SDLP’s submissions. You cannot go back; you
                must go forward. You cannot be a wrecker; you must be
                constructive. You cannot be negative; you must be positive. So
                if you do not agree to let Sinn Féin in to government, you are
                the wrecker.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let me remind Sinn Féin Members that those
                of us on this side of the Chamber have not spent the last
                30&nbsp;years trying to prove that Northern Ireland is a failed
                political entity. We were not the ones who boycotted
                institutions from the 1982 Assembly onwards. We were not the
                ones who, when things were not going our way, decided to run
                down to Dublin to try to muster support for an unreasonable
                point of view. We want to see Northern Ireland working. But
                politics in Northern Ireland cannot work if one adopts the
                immoral stance of putting those who have wrecked this country in
                to its Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The choice before the House is simple. It can
                either support Mr&nbsp;McCartney’s motion, which emphasises
                that only democrats have a place in government, or it can
                surrender to those who insist on retaining their guns because
                they know that their demands are so unreasonable that the only
                levers available to them are Semtex and the gun.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ervine:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ulster Unionists should be careful about the
                motion. Paragraph c does not contain an opportunity for
                tokenism, and the Ulster Unionist Leader’s speech in Oslo
                undoubtedly introduced the possibility of tokenism. Mr&nbsp;Weir
                diminished any possibility of tokenism, and went on to say that
                one third of the arms would do. Any terrorist organisation with
                two thirds of its arms intact could inflict a serious blow.
                Those were Mr&nbsp;Weir’s words, and Hansard will clarify the
                matter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If tokenism is what people are about, they
                will be boxed in. Tokenism is a joke because people who are left
                with a small number of guns could operate a policy of work study
                and use the guns more often by passing them around. Mr&nbsp;Weir
                spoke about his penchant for Unionist unity. Those who advocated
                tokenism should carefully read the wording of pargraph c. It
                does not advocate tokenism. It wants absolute, total, complete
                and utter decommissioning. I hope that we all want that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The many facets of the agreement were played
                out in living colour. Few, if any, of them were universally
                loved. Its creation was a great surprise to a vast swath of the
                population whose doubts about the matter probably had their
                foundation in a belief that their politicians were unwilling or
                incapable of doing what needed to be done.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The run-up to the referendum was a difficult
                time for those in the Unionist tradition. However, the moral
                imperatives which drove opinion have been passed into law by the
                greater number of people. Issues that were so disliked are to
                the fore, and that will continue. What do we do now? Do those
                who have a specific difficulty with the agreement continue to
                harbour annoyance, or do they accept the will of the people and
                embrace the only real chance that this society has to practise
                accountable democracy?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is foolish to dismiss the extent to which
                emotion plays a part in our political life. But to be consumed
                by emotion when trying to chart a course to the future is likely
                to end in disaster. As things stand, that is how it will end. We
                are told that Trimble and Adams cannot move. If that is the
                case, this process will go down, and that would please some
                people. Some Sinn&nbsp;Féin hearts may harbour the notion that
                that would not be a bad idea, provided the daft oul Prods get
                the blame for it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I heard two inane comments when I was in the
                talks. One was the assertion that Sinn&nbsp;Féin does not
                represent the IRA, which prompted me to say at the time that we
                should get the IRA in because it was the people in that
                organisation with whom we had to deal.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The other remark was made by
                Mr&nbsp;McCartney. It was similar to things he said this morning
                in giving a litany of immorality in relation to punishment
                beatings and shootings. This morning, however, he left out the
                caveat &quot;If this is peace, give me war.&quot; And I have
                plenty of witnesses.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Absolutely, and a couple in his own party
                perhaps.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another issue that I should mention to the
                exalted Gentleman is that at least four others now realise that
                they cannot tell anything to the man who knows everything. It is
                that time of year — Christmas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Perhaps this is the right time to encourage
                people to examine why paramilitary ceasefires were called in the
                first place. Were the ceasefires not some form of acceptance by
                the paramilitarists that the war was futile, that it is was
                unwinnable? But being in a war that is unwinnable is not the
                same as being defeated. There are those who have no concept of
                the difficulties that we have been going through. We know about
                the pain, the blood and the brains on the pavements; we know
                about news programmes by the day; we know about the suffering
                before, during and after the ceasefires. We know about all that,
                but we do not seem to have a formula or any policy that can
                cross the religious and political divide and give the people an
                opportunity to believe that there is a way out or a light at the
                end of the tunnel.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those Members who have listened to me
                suggesting that we are heading for disaster may be pleased, but
                let me point out a couple of salient political facts — even
                though I am only an amateur. There is a British Prime Minister
                who is probably in the worst position that any British Prime
                Minister has been in in relation to Northern&nbsp;Ireland. This
                is not because there is not as much violence to deal with; it is
                because 71·12% of the population of Northern&nbsp;Ireland
                copper-fastened an agreement that is in danger of collapsing.
                What happens if Nationalism is able to pin that on Unionism?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Mr&nbsp;McCartney advocates, as
                Mr&nbsp;Roche advocates, as the DUP advocates, there is no start
                date for decommissioning in the agreement. The question is
                therefore this; when does one resign from a deal, from a
                contract and from a covenant? That question will be asked of
                Unionism. It is also a question that the British Prime Minister
                will be asked about when Nationalism raps at the door of
                Downing&nbsp;Street and says this: &quot;We know,
                Prime&nbsp;Minister, that it is difficult to manage a divided
                society, but it is worse than that. Our democratic rights have
                been denied by those who sat outside Castle&nbsp;Buildings,
                sharpened the knives, ran away from the problem, refused to deal
                with it and waited for the suckers to come out, waited for the
                people who have risked life and everything else to try to create
                an opportunity for a better way forward for the people of
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland.&quot;</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In a couple of years’ time when the Prime
                Minister has deliberated with Bertie&nbsp;Ahern and thought
                about what he might do to give Nationalism its political
                expression — as the Good Friday Agreement, copper-fastened by
                71·12% of the people, was supposed to do — does anybody think
                that the next thing to come will be a Unionist agenda? Are
                Members sure it will be a Unionist agenda or are they happy
                enough just to sing ‘The&nbsp;Sash’ and think loudly that
                everything will be all right? It will not be. If the deal is not
                done and honoured, the consequences will be very difficult.
                People have said that Sinn&nbsp;Féin and the IRA will not win.
                I have said that all my adult life. There are young, and not so
                young, people in the community who will take that literally.
                When they find that it is not a Unionist agenda and that
                Unionism has no part of the agenda that follows the collapse of
                the Good Friday Agreement, we will be in bloody awful turmoil. I
                know who I will blame. I will not support Mr&nbsp;McCartney’s
                motion.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms McWilliams:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This has been a rather depressing debate,
                full of certainties from some Members. If, as he claims,
                Rev&nbsp;William&nbsp;McCrea is not treacherous, it makes the
                rest of us extremely treacherous. Mr&nbsp;Weir, who seemed to be
                making up his speech as he went along, told us that Union First
                wants the decommissioning of one third of the IRA’s arms. No
                doubt, next time we return to the Chamber, it will be two
                thirds. Mr&nbsp;McGimpsey told us that some parties are here
                because they have nowhere else to go. I remind him that, as well
                as the DUP, to whom he addressed his remarks, there are other
                parties here who have nowhere else to go. That may not be the
                best reason for us being here, but I agree with Mr&nbsp;Durkan,
                who said that subsidised inaction has gone on for too long. We
                are here to do business, and it is time that we got on with it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Nesbitt does not know much about marriage
                if he thinks that husbands and wives are always inextricably
                linked. They act independently, and if he knew anything about
                women’s rights he would know that that is what women seek when
                building partnerships — agreement to live with differences
                through thick and thin. Mr&nbsp;Sammy&nbsp;Wilson knows even
                less about divorce if he thinks that the husband gets to pick
                his wife’s lawyer.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Certainty after certainty have been repeated.
                Change creates uncertainty, and that is difficult. But I would
                rather have the uncertainties of today than the violence and
                mayhem of the past. We went into the agreement with some speed,
                but it was right to do that, try to avoid creating a vacuum
                which would create tension, such as we find in the Chamber. The
                only certainty now is that in May 71% of the people told us to
                make the agreement work. That does not ignore the fact, which
                was mentioned by the First Minister (Designate) in Oslo, that
                there is a cultural conflict between Nationalism and Unionism.
                It is true that Nationalism often deals in aspirations, but it
                is unfair to say that it always deals in aspirations, and not
                with realities. I have seen Nationalism combine both.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is equally unfair to Unionism to say that
                it deals only with basic issues and not with wider aspirations.
                The agreement brought those two sides together, and taught us
                how to compromise. Members will realise that we would not have
                an agreement if one side had gained 100% of its objectives. It
                is, of course, easy for Mr&nbsp;Wilson to use absolutes to
                demonise people, but people such as Mrs&nbsp;de&nbsp;Brún, a
                member of Sinn Féin, are here to work. Mr&nbsp;Wilson should
                bear that in mind, as should those members of his party who will
                attend the meeting of the Committee to Advise the Presiding
                Officer. They should head not simply for the door, as they would
                like to do, but up the stairs, where the work is being done.
                They should not just stand there, acting out a political charade
                for the benefit of the television cameras. We will go on
                working.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have not spent as much time as we should
                on other issues. We have concentrated on decommissioning and the
                politics of ultimatums. Perhaps one day we will have a healthy
                debate with Mr&nbsp;Wilson about the inclusion of more women in
                decision-making in Northern&nbsp;Ireland politics, which is in
                the agreement, or on community development as a strategic
                approach to resolving our problems.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Hour after hour, we have heard about
                wonderful solutions to our criminal justice problems.
                Mr&nbsp;Weir, an Ulster Unionist Back-Bencher, said that he
                wanted all criminal activity to stop, and said that he could
                stop it. The agreement will not stop all criminal activity. We
                are politicians, not police officers.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My words were that we need to see an end to
                criminal activity, and that terrorist organisations that were
                still involved in such activity should not benefit from
                Government office. I did not say that I could stop it.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms McWilliams:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Weir said that all criminal activity must
                stop now. We went into the negotiations not as criminal justice
                experts, but as political negotiators, and we are here as
                politicians. Let the police and politicians get on with their
                respective jobs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The criminal activity to which Mr&nbsp;Weir
                and others referred is a fraction of that which occurs in this
                country. Member after Member spoke about the broken bones of
                individuals in communities, but we do not often hear about
                people who are beaten in their homes. When we talk about what
                constitutes terror, let us include all unacceptable forms of
                violence, be they domestic or, as Mr&nbsp;Weir would call it,
                but I would not, political.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCartney’s motion refers to
                paramilitary organisations, and he spoke about the criminal
                activity of paramilitary organisations on the ground. Anyone who
                has worked on community development will know that people are
                trying to stop individuals — not organisations. I will lend
                them all the support that I can.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mark Durkan made an honest speech in which,
                for the first time in the debate, he highlighted where the
                problems lay. I should like to request more consultations on
                those problems. In the negotiations we hit hurdles, but many
                parties brought their minds to bear on the problems and they
                were resolved. That consultation has stopped, and we need to
                restart it. In the absence of the departmental meetings, we must
                appoint liaison officers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fears were expressed in Oslo.
                Mr&nbsp;Trimble was right when he said that Unionism had built a
                cold house for Nationalism. It was also a hot house for
                Unionism. Those are both sides’ fears for the future. Will
                people do again what they have done in the past? Will policemen
                be legitimate targets? Will we have a recurrence of past
                violence? Will it be a cold house, that does not respect our
                legitimate rights, or will people share in Government?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must try to create the cornerstone that
                will make this House a place in which everyone’s traditions
                are respected. Both sides fear that one day they will be an
                alienated minority. Only the agreement can end that fear, and it
                is time that we set up a Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Three things need to be done. First, we must
                set up the Departments and get into shadow mode. Secondly, let
                us set up the implementation bodies, not through force but in
                co-operation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The third concerns confidence-building. Our
                civic society has gone quiet about this political agreement —
                the trade unions, the business organisations, and the churches
                as well as the paramilitary organisations. Perhaps that is the
                formula that we need: that they are all behind our political
                agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I oppose the motion and the amendments
                because they ask for a final report. When the report comes to
                the Chamber it should be in draft form so that we all have an
                opportunity to debate it.</p>

                that you compare how we do things with what happens in another
                place. Perhaps you could look at the way our debates are
                conducted in future. In no other House would 100%&nbsp;of the
                Members belonging to a small party be called to speak in any
                debate. My party is small in the House of Commons — there are

                speak. Why should 100% of one party be able to speak whereas
                Members from other parties who represent 10 or 20 or 30 times
                more of the people of Northern Ireland are not being heard?
                Something needs to be done about that if this is to be a

                another place. Requirements and restrictions have been put upon
                me by my advisory group, which makes it extremely difficult for
                me simply to follow what happens there. It is a constant
                struggle both to follow what happens there and to be equitable
                and reasonable. I continue to monitor what happens not only in

                yesterday that I can recall. I understand your concern, and I do
                not profess to get it right every time. I am very much in the
                hands of the Whips, and will continue to do my best, though
                imperfectly. Like all other Members, I hope to learn from
                experience.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In other places it is traditional to speak
                through the Chair. This is not to glorify the position of the
                Chair, much less its incumbent, but to ensure that Members do
                not, by referring directly to each other, get into an unhelpful
                to-and-fro. I appeal to Members to observe the proprieties —
                not, I accept, those in our Initial Standing Orders, which are
                deeply inadequate — and the traditions of other places. Doing
                so will facilitate a less inappropriately robust exchange of
                views.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Foster:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As an Ulster Unionist, I seek peace, but not
                at any price. I seek progress, but not at any price. I seek
                confidence-building, but that is not going to happen unless
                there is decommissioning, and for that reason I support
                Mr&nbsp;McCartney’s motion. I take it that the motion is
                intended to be constructive rather than contentious, and I am
                glad that he and the DUP have now joined forces with the Ulster
                Unionist Party to supporting the decommissioning issue — it is
                only a few short weeks since his party was making excuses for
                Sinn Féin/IRA’s not decommissioning.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I decry the rhetoric of Sinn Féin. I am not
                convinced by it. I think that it is plausible and unctuous. Its
                deceit is evident, and it is time that it began to prove itself
                to society instead of vice versa. I am disappointed in the
                Alliance Party today — I thought it had more spine. Surely it
                should be supporting us on decommissioning as well. Does it fear
                what is in the undergrowth? Alliance’s was a weak and pathetic
                show today, an exercise in playing to the gallery.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I heard Mr&nbsp;Ford on the radio this
                morning talking about being constructive. I would like him and
                everyone else in the Assembly to know that the UUP has always
                been constructive for the Province, throughout the years of its
                existence. We have never tried to bomb the Province out of
                existence, nor have we tried to make it unworkable — we have
                no apologies to make to anyone. We lead and hope that others are
                beginning to follow.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The UUP will keep its promises and its part
                of the bargain in the agreement. We will not be rushed into
                doing things that are not right — we are just as entitled to
                negotiate as others. In my opinion, others are stretching the
                agreement to the full — they are seeking extras. Everything
                that is talked about has to have all-Ireland involvement. We are
                not about to jump into that pool without any thought about it
                whatsoever.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Getting back to decommissioning, IRA/Sinn
                Féin and its paramilitary associates have a moral
                responsibility to decommission because that is an indispensable
                part of the agreement. That cannot be denied, and it is not a
                precondition whatsoever. It is a condition of the agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After all these months, every part of the
                agreement seems to be moving except the decommissioning part.
                The onus is on Sinn Féin to take this forward. Her Majesty’s
                Government keep letting prisoners out without any reciprocation
                whatsoever. I urge that prisoner releases be stopped until
                decommissioning commences.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is also a threat along the border, as
                reported by the Eire authorities. They are sending some of their
                elite gárda along the border. In spite of that, I am reliably
                informed that three or four check-points along the
                Fermanagh-Monaghan border are about to be dismantled. This is a
                very premature decision. It is leaving people in the
                Roslea-Newtownbutler part of Fermanagh feeling exposed and at
                risk.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When we talk about keeping to exclusively
                peaceful means we cannot forget about the Donegal Celtic/RUC
                issue. Was that not intimidation? Is that what the agreement
                envisaged?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After Omagh, and after 30 years of violence
                and murder, with people’s bodies being picked up in body bags
                by the RUC, everyone was saying &quot;This must never ever
                happen again.&quot; Everyone should be in this Chamber saying
                there must be decommissioning before there is any further
                progress. People are back in their trenches now and beginning to
                turn a blind eye to the lack of decommissioning. If it does not
                happen, the Assembly will flounder. In spite of this, the UUP is
                the only party, until today, that has been pushing for
                decommissioning.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are talking about setting up bodies and
                Departments — that is ridiculous before decommissioning. We
                are being asked to set up a Government in spite of the fact that
                we know that, outside in the undergrowth, there are weapons and
                equipment ready to be used — a-gun-to-the-head attitude. Is
                that what we are being asked to do? Are we being asked to govern
                in spite of the fact that there are illegal armies and equipment
                out there?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Presiding&nbsp;Officer, do you really
                feel that you could preside over a Government? Would it be
                credible or incredible? Would it be a credible or incredible
                Assembly? Would it be dishonest or honest? Would it be deceit or
                falsehood or a lack of integrity? Are there no morals
                whatsoever?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Surely we cannot begin to govern until there
                is decommissioning when peace, I hope, will be absolute. The
                onus is on Sinn Féin/IRA to do so. It is not on the UUP. We
                have reached out the hand of friendship; we have been positive;
                we want to work for the good of all people; but other people
                have to work as well. I trust that all parties in the Assembly
                will put pressure on Sinn Féin/IRA. Decommissioning is a must,
                and nothing will move until that comes about.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Initial Presiding Officer:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was a rhetorical point. I can assure you
                that I will not be presiding over any Government. Debates are as
                far as my remit allows.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Hendron:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As somebody who has attended people with
                broken bones, broken bodies and broken hearts for many years, I
                feel that I have some important points to make.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, I want to address the Member for Lagan
                Valley, Mr&nbsp;Roche, who had the cheek to give my party a
                lecture on democracy. Let me remind him that the SDLP, with our
                Leader, John&nbsp;Hume, at the helm, has been at the forefront
                of democracy and real politics in this land for over
                25&nbsp;years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, I listened to the very eloquent and
                passionate speech by the DUP Member for Mid Ulster, Mr&nbsp;McCrea,
                a speech that I have heard many times before in the House of
                Commons. While I can agree with some of the points that he made,
                I thought there was a certain hypocrisy about the general timbre
                of what he said. I recall very clearly — and so does a large
                proportion of the population of this land — his standing on a
                certain platform.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hesitate to make this point because a
                certain other person on that platform was foully murdered after
                that. At the time the Member said that his actions were in
                support of the right of that person to speak, that it was to do
                with democracy. I say to him that, to many thousands of people
                in the North of Ireland, he was by his actions giving succour,
                either wittingly or unwittingly, to the organisation to which
                that person belonged and which had murdered many people. That
                incident was not very long ago. Let us have no hypocrisy from
                Mr&nbsp;McCrea.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Having spent the last 30 years in medical
                practice in West Belfast, taking in the Nationalist
                Falls&nbsp;Road and the Unionist Shankill&nbsp;Road, and having
                been a public representative for 25&nbsp;years in the same
                territory, and elected to conventions, Assemblies, Belfast City
                Council, the House of Commons and this Assembly, I have some
                experience in these matters. Though it does not seem so long
                ago, it was in 1975, in the Northern&nbsp;Ireland Convention
                just after the fall of the power-sharing Executive, that the
                UUUC, the combined Unionist parties, led by Harry&nbsp;West, sat
                across this Chamber.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was pleased to see Mr&nbsp;West recently in
                this building and am glad that he is very well. At that
                particular time, opposite the UUUC sat the SDLP, the Alliance
                Party and Brian&nbsp;Faulkner with his small band of Unionists
                who belonged to the UPNI. The key words on both sides that year
                were &quot;magnanimity&quot; — everybody talked about it —
                and &quot;trust&quot;. I had never heard anything like it. One
                would have thought that there was a love affair between the two
                sides. However, the truth was that nobody trusted anybody.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have come a long, long way since 1975. We
                have moved mountains since then, and I salute all the people and
                politicians in both communities who have brought that change
                about. As the Leader of the Ulster Unionist Party and First
                Minister (Designate) has said many times, people can change.
                Those previously involved in violence and paramilitarism on both
                sides — many good people who have made mistakes and have done
                things that were wrong — have given brilliant leadership.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was in 1975, in this Chamber, that
                Bill&nbsp;Craig broke away from the UUUC — or, to put it more
                correctly, was pushed away because he proposed voluntary
                coalition. The Leader of the Ulster Unionist Party was part of
                that grouping, but at least he was trying to make some progress.
                The years have passed on since then.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I could go on about the many people I have
                known in West Belfast, patients and constituents, who have been
                brutally murdered. Indeed, I still see some of their family
                members.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.30 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the attacks that have been
                made on Sinn Féin here. I am not a member of that organisation.
                I took on its party Leader at four Westminster elections, having
                taken the seat from him in 1992 and then, after a massive
                redrawing of the boundaries, he took it back again. I have no
                problem with that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We would be wearing blinkers if we were to
                say that they were separate organisations. I totally agree with
                that. But there is an element of hypocrisy in the Chamber today.
                I believe that those people who were elected for Sinn Féin in
                the North of Ireland are trying to lead the Republican movement
                down the road of democracy, and that is the important thing
                about this. We can all scream and shout about things that
                happened in the past, though my experience of families who have
                lost loved ones is that the great majority support this
                agreement and want the First Minister (Designate) and the Deputy
                First Minister (Designate) to set up the Executive and the
                North/South bodies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the past we have had Vanguard, Ulster
                Resistance and the crowds acting like the grand old Duke of York’s
                men who went up the hill waving hundreds or thousands — I am
                not sure — of gun licences. Some would say that they were
                legal. Perhaps they were, but they were winding up the
                paramilitaries.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many times in Nationalist West Belfast I
                heard of other people wearing little red berets. I am not saying
                that they were directly involved in violence, but by their
                actions they were winding up the paramilitary organisations. I
                am tired of hypocrisy</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I come again to Sinn Féin and
                decommissioning. My Colleague Mr&nbsp;Durkan, the Member for
                Foyle, made the point clearly that this is not the
                responsibility of the First or the Deputy First Ministers
                (Designate). I am aware of people who have been banished by the
                IRA; I know some of them and have intervened on their behalf.
                Almost every week I see families who have been intimidated by
                the IRA, and I am sure that there are families who have been
                intimidated by Loyalist paramilitaries. I cannot speak with any
                authority on that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members may ask why I do not support some of
                the points that have been made on the other side of the House.
                The answer is, as I have just said, that I actually trust the
                people from Sinn Féin who have been elected here — they do
                have a mandate and politically it is not in their interest for
                somebody to go out and smash somebody’s knees.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1975 there was much talk about trust. We
                have moved a long way since then and there should be less talk
                about decommissioning now and more action. As Mr&nbsp;Mallon
                said this morning,</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;In politics you do not stand still; you
                either move backward or you move forward.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCartney, the Member for North Down, who
                moved the motion — and I do not mean this in any condescending
                way — spoke with great integrity. I believe that he is an
                honourable man. He speaks with great clarity and gives much
                thought to what he is going to say. He makes his point with
                clinical precision but politics is the art of the possible, and
                this is not a court of law. You cannot take the situation as it
                is and find a perfect solution; it is not like putting all the
                little bits of a puzzle together. I do not mean this in any
                condescending way. I accept the sincerity of the points that he
                makes, but if we follow the logic of what he and some of his
                Colleagues are saying, we are not going to get any agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The people who are giving leadership in both
                communities to organisations that have been involved in murder
                should be supported, and that, I believe, is the will of the
                people of the North of Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My speaking time may be running out, but the
                days are running out as well. People on the Falls Road and on
                the Shankill Road — and both communities are represented here
                — are calling for this agreement to be implemented and for the
                First and Deputy First Ministers (Designate) to form the
                Executive. They also want the North/South Council to be formed
                along with the other bodies associated with it.</p>

                guns; 25 heavy weapons; 1·5 million rounds of ammunition (one
                for everyone in the Province); seven Russian-made flame
                throwers; 9 Sam 7b ground-to-air missiles; 11&nbsp;RPG 7
                launchers; 46 RPG missiles; and 2 Barrett Light Fifty rifles.
                That is just the IRA’s catalogue of weaponry — a substantial
                hoard. It is no recipe for peace. These are not the resources
                that one would expect a &quot;peaceful and democratic&quot;
                organisation to have.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some say &quot;Give away 95% of it.&quot;
                Five per cent of that list would be sufficient to carry on a
                campaign of some significance, and they could replenish whatever
                stocks were given up. The reality is that those who wish to
                follow &quot;exclusively democratic and peaceful means&quot; do
                not need guns and explosives to make their case.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In practice, these weapons end up being used
                for criminal purposes, as happened in South Africa. Their
                removal also takes away a threat which gives Sinn Féin/IRA an
                advantage in bargaining. They do not give up their weapons
                because they provide them with an edge that they can take into
                negotiations. They are saying &quot;If you do not give in to us
                then we will be out on the streets using these weapons.&quot;</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The key issue is one of trust. The joint
                declaration stated the rules for entry to the political and
                democratic process: there had to be a permanent end to violence;
                parties had to be exclusively committed to peaceful and
                democratic means. The refusal of Sinn Féin/IRA to offer the
                word &quot;permanent&quot; suggested to the Unionist community
                that their organisation had not yet left violence behind and
                that they intended, if they did not get things their own way in
                the proceedings that would follow, to use the weapons again to
                further press the people of Northern&nbsp;Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I opposed the agreement because
                decommissioning was not required. The participants simply have
                to use their influence, such as they have, to try and bring
                about decommissioning. Not only was there no requirement for
                decommissioning; there was to be no sanction if it did not take
                place. It is wrong, therefore, for the Women’s Coalition to
                suggest that if, in two years time, the guns have not been
                handed over, the whole edifice collapses. The agreement does not
                say that. There is a requirement in any society for those who
                are legitimate, constitutional, peaceful and democratic to give
                up any weapons they may have at their disposal.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The clearest parallel in the agreement to
                decommissioning is that of the release of prisoners. Both are
                within a two-year time frame, and the legislation on sentences
                links decommissioning with the release of prisoners. It
                indicates that the Secretary of State has the power, if parties
                have not established or are not maintaining a complete and
                unequivocal ceasefire, to take them off the list. One reason for
                doing so is if they are not co-operating fully in the
                decommissioning scheme. Sinn Féin/IRA are not doing that:
                therefore the release of their prisoners should not continue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has been much talk about the 71% of
                people who voted for the agreement. The Democratic Unionist
                Party has been asked what it is doing in the Assembly as it
                opposes the agreement. We are in the Assembly because we have
                been given a mandate. As democrats, we recognise the fact that
                71% of the people supported the agreement. They voted for
                promises that were made by the Prime Minister and the First
                Minister (Designate) in the referendum campaign.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was clear, during that campaign, that the
                overwhelming majority of the Unionist community intended to
                oppose the agreement. The opinion polls that were regularly
                obtained by the Northern Ireland Office showed that. Focus
                groups were set up to find out why the Unionist community
                intended to vote in that way.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Prime Minister put all his team into
                Northern Ireland. Presidents, Prime Ministers, pop stars, party
                leaders and business leaders were wheeled into the Province to
                try to change the views of the people of Northern Ireland. It
                did not work. The Prime Minister had to give pledges
                interpreting the agreement and showing what it would mean to the
                people of Northern&nbsp;Ireland. In the House of Commons,
                Mr&nbsp;Hague said to the Prime Minister</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;May I welcome what the Prime Minister
                has said in the past about the need for decommissioning to take
                place before Sinn Féin members can serve as Ministers in the
                Assembly? … Does he agree that prisoners should not be
                released early until the organisations to which they belong have
                substantially decommissioned their weapons?&quot;</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Hansard does not record exactly what the
                Prime Minister said in response. I raised this with the Speaker
                of the House of Commons on a point of order. The Editor of
                Debates in the House of Commons wrote to the Speaker as follows:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;I can confirm that certain words were
                deleted. That deletion was carried out by us.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Prime Minister’s exact words were ‘What
                is essential is that any agreement must be signed up to in full,
                as we said, and the answer to his question is yes of course it
                is the case that, both in respect of taking seats in the
                government of Northern Ireland and in respect of the early
                release of prisoners, the only organisations that qualify for
                that are organisations that have given up violence and given it
                up for good.’ &quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Prime Minister came to
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland to campaign. On 14 May he said</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;People need to know that if they are
                sitting down in the room of the Executive of the Northern
                Ireland Assembly with other people then they are not sitting
                there with the guns under the table, outside the door and all
                the rest of it. That can’t happen and we must make it
                absolutely clear that that can’t happen.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During that campaign the Prime Minister
                signed an advertisement containing five commitments to the
                people of Northern&nbsp;Ireland, two of which are relevant to
                this issue:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Those who use or threaten to use
                violence must be excluded from the government of Northern
                Ireland, and prisoners kept in unless violence is given up for
                good.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">His most telling comment appeared in the
                Belfast ‘News Letter’ and, I believe, in ‘The Irish News’
                on Friday 22 May — the day of the referendum itself:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;I have spent a great deal of the time
                talking to people about their concerns, and I believe the
                fundamental concern is this; how can people be sure that the
                present cease-fires are not merely tactical and that the
                terrorists will not reap the benefits of the Agreement, while
                retaining the possibility of a return to violence?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Agreement itself is specifically designed
                to prevent this happening — and I have made clear in the
                pledge I gave on Wednesday that I will make the Agreement stick.
                There can be no accelerated prisoner releases unless the
                organisations and individuals concerned have clearly given up
                violence for good — and there is no amnesty in any event.
                Representatives of parties intimately linked to paramilitary
                groups can only be in a future Northern Ireland government if it
                is clear that there will be no more violence and the threat of
                violence has gone. That doesn’t just mean decommissioning but
                all bombings, killings, beatings and an end to targeting,
                recruitment and all the structures of terrorism.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Prime Minister identified decommissioning
                and dismantling as the requirements for entry into government,
                and before the release of prisoners would take place.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that every Unionist and every democrat
                in the House will support the motion in the name of
                Mr&nbsp;McCartney. There can be no place in the Government of
                Northern Ireland for those who still leave themselves the option
                of going back to violence if they do not get their way within
                the Cabinet. Let all Members declare very clearly to Sinn Féin/IRA
                that the guns must be handed over or there will be no room for
                them in an Executive.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCartney:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This has been an interesting and illuminating
                debate, not only for what has been said but also for what has
                not been said.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The contributions of the First and the Deputy
                First Ministers (Designate) can only be described as an exchange
                between Basil Fawlty and Manuel — do not mention
                decommissioning.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There was a total absence of any reference to
                the decommissioning issue at all, and some other Members,
                notably Mr&nbsp;Farren and to some extent Mr&nbsp;Durkan,
                decided that they would take on the mantle of not mentioning
                decommissioning, though otherwise they made very interesting and
                worthwhile contributions. In winding up I would like to respond
                to as many contributions as possible, and it may be necessary to
                group some of them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, I want to deal with the contributions
                of the First Minister, Mr&nbsp;McGimpsey and Mr&nbsp;Foster, who
                seem to be under the delusion that there is some inconsistency
                between my previous view and my support for this motion. There
                is no inconsistency, as I will explain.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have always said that the agreement did
                not, expressly or by implication, put any obligation upon any of
                the parties actually to decommission. Indeed, it is quite clear
                that paragraph 3 of the decommissioning section only requires
                parties to use such influence as they may have upon those who
                possess weapons to decommission within two years. But, if they
                do not decommission, it will be virtually impossible to prove
                that those who have influence actually used it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have always held and advocated the view
                that is central both to my opening speech and to the motion that
                no agreement, no Government and no mandate can supersede or set
                aside the fundamental requirements of the democratic procedure
                itself. A person simply cannot be a democrat, possess weapons
                and say that if the democratic process fails to give him what he
                wants, he will carry out violence against those who deny him.
                That is a fundamental principle of democracy, whether it is in
                the agreement or not.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My opposition to the agreement is that this
                fundamental democratic requirement was never explicitly spelt
                out and that, by that failure, Sinn Féin was afforded some
                legalistic and literal opportunity to say that it was not
                required to decommission. For the present, I am delighted that
                all the pro-Union parties feel that they can, whatever the
                various routes they have taken to arrive at the conclusion,
                support this motion.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Foster:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will not.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I make no mention of the Alliance Party
                because I have difficulty in discerning where it is, but that is
                a problem which even Mr&nbsp;Nesbitt has difficulty in getting
                his mind round.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let me move on to some of Sinn Féin’s
                contributions. I am delighted at this seasonal and festive time
                to note that the works of Hans Christian Andersen and the
                Brothers Grimm have been added to the &quot;green book&quot;. We
                have listened to fairy tales about the absence of any connection
                between Sinn Féin and the IRA. These fairy tales extend to the
                PUP too.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I assume that the tooth fairy and other
                mythological creatures are operating in vast numbers in West and
                East Belfast, and that it is they who are really the villains
                whom the police should be asking about the broken bones, the
                murders, the drug peddling, the creaming off of a percentage
                from drug dealers, the extortion, the racketeering, all the
                oppression, the intimidation and the enforced exiles.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Ervine talked about people having a
                pension — I think he meant &quot;penchant&quot; — for
                creating bridges. It is obvious that he saw himself in the role
                of bridge builder. But what bridges are being built and of what
                are the materials that those organisations, the PUP and Sinn
                Féin are using? They are murder, mayhem and mutilation. These
                people talk as if they have discovered the wheel of ecumenism as
                if they are at the forefront.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To those who see me as some sort of wrecker I
                can say that I have never murdered, maimed or made any sectarian
                comments. I have absolutely no baggage of a sectarian nature,
                nor has my party. Representatives like Mrs&nbsp;de&nbsp;Brún
                and Mr&nbsp;Martin&nbsp;McGuinness say that people like me are
                opposed to the equality agenda or to fairness, or that we are
                the sort of people who &quot;would not have a Fenian about the
                place&quot;. I believe that by &quot;Fenians&quot; (a very
                dismissive term) Mr&nbsp;McGuinness means Roman Catholics. Well,
                I have news for him. I have full cousins who are Catholic; my
                son is married to a Catholic; I have been in almost every
                Catholic church in Belfast and many in Rome. I believe
                passionately in the reformed faith, but I am so confident in
                that faith that I have no difficulty in exposing it to the faith
                of others. I have been employed by the Catholic Church as a
                professional barrister, I have been employed by Catholics, and I
                have employed Catholics.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have no problems of any kind with
                Catholics, Nationalists or Fenians, but I do have an enormous
                problem with gunmen, thugs and villains who use violence for the
                purpose of achieving any aim, whether it be alleged social
                equality or some other form of equality. I have no desire to
                enforce my views upon anyone, but I will not be subjected to
                violence or to the threat of violence.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hear some of these reformed criminals
                speaking, yet they are the sort of people who supported Loyalist
                gangs who went in with machine guns and sprayed teagues and
                Catholics.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These are the people whose inmates had murals
                on the walls of the Maze saying &quot;Yabba Yabba Do, any teague
                will do.&quot; These are the people who say that democrats —
                people who believe in the rule of law and in sharing but who
                oppose this agreement politically and democratically — cannot
                be good unless they have previously been vile. A Member cannot
                be good unless he has a record of destruction, murder and
                mayhem. I am delighted that the UUP, DUP, UKUP and, I sincerely
                hope, members of the SDLP do not share such views. The SDLP
                Leader once said that there could be no discussion with guns
                outside the door, or on or under the table. I respect that view
                and I agree with it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have already quoted the Foreign Minister of
                the Republic, who said that there could be no question of gunmen
                looking at the democratic process, not liking what it has to
                offer, and going back to what they do best. John&nbsp;Bruton,
                who at the time of the Downing Street declaration was the Fine
                Gael Opposition Leader, said that the joint declaration meant
                that guns had to be handed in now. &quot;Now&quot; is a short
                word, but it has a clear meaning. It means immediately,
                forthwith, at once, without delay. There is no equivocation
                about its meaning now. That was the basis on which all Unionists
                and all democrats were led to believe that this process was
                founded. That was the direction that we were all to take.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Why is there an absence of trust and
                confidence in the pro-Union community? Because at every stage of
                the process those who were asked to give trust were the
                pro-Union community. According to paragraph 34 of the Mitchell
                Report, they were asked to believe during the negotiations that
                there would be parallel advancement of decommissioning and
                political negotiation. I did not agree with that. I agreed with
                Churchill’s comment about negotiating and compromising with
                Fascists. He asked where was the point of compromise between the
                fireman and the arsonist.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No guns or explosives were being used by the
                parties represented in the main line pro-Union community. There
                were no guns in the SDLP, but there were guns in the possession
                of Sinn Féin and the UVF — fronted by the PUP. I again return
                to the political ecumenism of Assemblyman Ervine. His party said
                that even if Sinn Féin were to decommission, the UVF would not.
                That helpful and charitable statement was made when, perhaps,
                there were greater prospects of decommissioning than at present.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was honoured that Joe&nbsp;Hendron had
                sufficient confidence to retain me as his leading counsel when
                there was a petition to unseat him. I reveal no secrets that
                were not declared in open court. Evidence was given, not about
                guns, but about the behaviour of Sinn Féin as democrats during
                an election. The SDLP election agent had to be moved about from
                house to house during the election campaign for his own safety.
                If I am wrong I will give way to Joe&nbsp;Hendron. The windows
                of the SDLP offices were covered with human and animal faeces.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">SDLP workers were subjected to all sorts of
                vile and physical abuse, to threats and intimidation. This was
                not going on against pro-Union candidates, this was the dirtiest
                kind of internecine political warfare against a democratic
                party.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I, for my part, will work with Nationalists
                and will endeavour to understand and meet their needs. As
                Nationalists their aspirations are different from mine, but I
                will share with them — I have no problem about that. I will go
                along with all their equality arguments, provided that they are
                based on justice and proportionality. But, in return, I ask them
                to throw off the yoke of their pan-Nationalism which binds them
                to a collection of people who demonstrate all the attributes of
                Fascism.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I beg them, I implore them, to put democracy
                above party politics and lend their support to this motion.</p>

                finance to help today’s senior managers and research academics

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">His comments and subsequent announcements
                from the Government make it clear that science-and
                technologybased companies could be the means by which Northern
                Ireland might excel in the future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The potential for the growth of science- and
                technology-based companies has been described as being
                equivalent to the onset of the Industrial Revolution. Those
                regions which are able to offer a market advantage and are
                willing to bring about the change necessary to embrace new
                products and innovative thinking, even though lead times will be
                longer, and expenditure on research and development will be
                higher, will be the affluent areas of the future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Science or research and enterprise parks are
                widely accepted as providing a focus for knowledge — intensive
                development through research network groups and start-up or
                spin-off companies and an environment that is conducive to it.
                The relationship between the knowledge factories and other
                relevant economic actors is essential for an efficient process
                of knowledge transfer.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Existing technology and incubator programmes,
                both in Europe and the United States, indicate that the presence
                of certain characteristics and features in a region are vital to
                the success of this type of initiative. These success factors
                include proximity to a major university with a critical mass of
                high technology expertise and research and development activity;
                a business climate that encourages and supports innovation and
                entrepreneurship; a well educated and skilled workforce and a
                source of incubator clients; access to appropriate training and
                specialist services; and availability of seed and venture
                capital and appropriate support from public-sector agencies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Experience in other regions which have
                embarked on a similar road in terms of science- and
                technology-based industry suggests that success is dependent on
                the ability of the university to promote its areas of excellence
                into the private sector and, at the same time, continue to
                nurture the embryo ideas into commercialisation. This approach
                raises many issues concerning ownership of the product, finding
                the right mix of entrepreneurs and scientists, the development
                of patents and licences and market testing and
                commercialisation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The successful development of science and
                technology parks in areas such as Pittsburgh, Boston and
                Horsholm in Denmark has not taken place in a random manner.
                Home-grown science- and technology-based companies have been
                nurtured in incubator units within the universities for many
                years before reaching maturity. Their potential to transform
                depressed areas ravaged by industrial decline is evident in the
                success of these regions, both in terms of low unemployment and
                the high quality of life reflected in the above-average salaries
                commanded by employees in these fields of excellence.</p>

                to maximise the benefit for our local economy, an infrastructure
                will have to be developed that stimulates and sustains the
                growth of spin-out companies after they leave a university
                campus incubator.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The inclusion of funding for science park
                development as part of the Chancellor’s recent innovation
                funding package for Northern Ireland is therefore a very welcome
                development that could help meet this objective. It will provide
                an opportunity for Northern Ireland to capitalise on the
                excellent research and development programmes already
                established at its universities — most notably in Belfast and
                Coleraine.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Coleraine campus, for example, is widely
                recognised for its outstanding work in the development of health
                and life technologies, based on its biomedical science, which
                has attracted top rating among all UK universities. This clearly
                gives Coleraine the pillars on which a successful biotechnology
                science park could be established. Similarly, other campuses in
                Northern Ireland offer potential for sector-specific excellence
                which will bring benefit to the whole Province.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important for Northern Ireland to grasp
                the concept of science parks and distinguish them from
                industrial parks. The future for science- and technology-based
                industry will revolutionise the modern world, and there are the
                opportunities in our present university system to capitalise on
                these dynamic developments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The commitment of the Assembly to the process
                and acceptance that we are working towards the long-term
                prosperity of the Province by stimulating a new and dynamic
                industry sector can be of use only if the areas of excellence
                where this research exists are used as the foundations.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Attwood:</p>
                </font></b><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important that the Assembly acknowledge
                that last Thursday was the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal
                Declaration of Human Rights, and it is important for two
                reasons.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, the Universal Declaration informed the
                notion of protection rights, which is central to the Good Friday
                Agreement that gave birth to this Chamber. Secondly, while not
                diminishing the conflict in our community, we are part of the
                international community where conflict has affected more people
                in more ways over more time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While the Universal Declaration expresses our
                world’s best hopes and achievements, it does so in the context
                of our worst fears and practices. The evidence confirms this.
                Last year there were extrajudicial executions in 69 countries,
                prisoners of conscience in 94 countries and torture in
                124&nbsp;countries. Thirteen million people were refugees, and
                300,000 under the age of 18 were child soldiers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, experience communicates better than
                these facts and figures. This week last year, Bairbre&nbsp;de&nbsp;Brún,
                David Ervine, Robert Coulter, Davy Adams, myself and others were
                in Soweto, outside Johannesburg. All of us can now conjure up
                images of Soweto informed by countless media reports of
                defiance, dignity and death, but nothing can prepare you for the
                experience of Soweto.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Amid the noise of up to 5&nbsp;million
                people, a silence fell among us. Nothing needed to be said,
                faced as we were with the rights issues of Sowetans —
                inadequate housing, sanitation and water, corrugated iron homes,
                standpipes and mobile lavatories at best. We saw extreme
                poverty, but far from extreme powerlessness. The issues are
                similar to the issues here, but far more intense.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What relevance can our conflict and our
                rights issues have to Soweto? I will return to that question
                later.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">More locally, issues of rights have been
                central to and representative of our conflict. The right to
                life, the right to a fair trial, freedom from discrimination and
                freedom of assembly and procession are all issues that have been
                part of our political conflict and the culture of our political
                communities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Often, when some have demanded rights, others
                have seen in those demands an attempt to deny their rights.
                People have felt that the ownership of rights has been more the
                possession of one community or the other rather than a common
                possession. The agreement of Good Friday offers a radical and
                refreshing perspective on how rights can be claimed by all for
                all.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The agreement properly places the present and
                future protection of rights in the context of our recent past.
                The agreement says that we must never forget those who have died
                or been injured or their families. We can best honour them
                through a fresh start in which we firmly dedicate ourselves to
                the achievement of reconciliation and to the protection and
                vindication of the rights of all.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As citizens, it must be acknowledged that
                this is a hard perspective for us to accept and that there will
                be some who may come to accept it slowly, if at all. We here are
                not just citizens; we have a wider public duty, and to fulfil it
                we can join together on the issue of rights.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Speaking in Belfast 10 days ago the United
                Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary&nbsp;Robinson,
                touched on this theme and talked about how those who congregate
                around issues of human rights are enriched by what she called
                &quot;a drama of discovery&quot;. She talked of how the
                marginalised understand more than victimhood, legal experts more
                than the law, and trade unionists more than jobs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This should also be the case in the political
                community. But vigilance and vigour will be required as the
                rights and requirements of the agreement are translated into
                policy and practice.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, the words of T E Lawrence, better
                known as Lawrence of Arabia, should be regarded as a call for
                vigilance:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;When we had achieved and the new world
                dawned, the old men came out again and remade the world in the
                likeness of the former world they knew. They thanked us kindly
                and made their peace.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The imprint of the old men in the North’s
                bureaucracy could be seen in the draft Settlement Bill, where
                some with influence and input frustrated the intent and content
                of the Good Friday Agreement. An external community lobby with
                internal political pressure reclaimed the agreement, but the
                need for vigilance persists.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The specification for the new post of Chief
                Commissioner in the Human Rights Commission is a case in point.
                As the only full-time Commissioner, this person will lead the
                consultation on a new Bill of Rights; he or she will promote
                awareness of rights, bring court proceedings and much more
                besides. Yet the Government’s job specification relegates a
                knowledge of human rights to being merely &quot;desirable&quot;
                and promotes management and bureaucratic skills with an apparent
                weighting towards a manager and a bureaucrat — weighting
                towards a civil servant as Chief Human Rights Commissioner. That
                is not the way to proceed. The UN Commissioner recently said
                that any human rights commission</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;composed of individuals committed to
                and with a strong record in the struggle for human rights is a
                prerequisite for the protection of the rights of all.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Vigilance is required.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, there is the question of funding
                for the newly merged Equality Commission — a merger which the
                Government say is not cost-driven. There are at least two tests
                of their assertion. In Britain the Government have given
                differential funding to the Disability Commission and the Equal
                Opportunities Commission — £1&nbsp;million and £6 million
                — to reflect the emphasis on disability rights, compared to
                gender rights.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will they accept the same principle in
                respect of the merged Equality Commission here? Given the
                increased functions of the fair employment branch of the new
                Equality Commission, particularly the new monitoring of public
                authorities aspect, will they match new funding with the new
                powers? This Government — and Minister Paul&nbsp;Murphy in
                particular — have responded to the human-rights lobby in the
                past; it is time they did so again.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thirdly, vigour is also required to ensure
                that the Human Rights Commission’s consultation on a future
                Bill of Rights for the North enjoys a full and free-standing
                budget and that the Commission does not have to borrow from its
                annual budget to fund a broad public debate on the content of
                the Bill. It is crucial that as a Bill of Rights is an essential
                building block in the creation of a culture of human rights, the
                Commission’s consultation is broad-based, local and
                international and involves other jurisdictions and agencies with
                specialist insight and information.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fourthly, given that the Government failed to
                honour the Paris principles and the powers of domestic human
                rights institutions, particularly on powers of investigation,
                the Assembly should follow the example of the British Government
                which has agreed to co-operate with any human-rights-commission
                enquiry or investigation. This would be symbolic as a
                substantial demonstration of our conviction and commitment to
                the emerging new order.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Last week the First Minister (Designate) said
                that he</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;had serious reservations about the
                merits of using any conflict as a model for the study, never
                mind the solution, of other conflicts&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Perhaps, on one issue at least,
                Mr&nbsp;Trimble will reconsider. Whatever differences there are
                between people in conflict, they all share the issue of rights.
                As a late Queen’s University academic, Frank&nbsp;Wright,
                said,</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;In national conflicts, law, order and
                justice are not issues that happen to arise from other causes.
                National conflicts, once they are fully developed, revolve
                around those issues&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Without rights there is no protection against
                summary detention or trial. Without equality there is no
                guarantee against discrimination or disadvantage. Different
                conflicts have common experiences, and with those common
                experiences come common solutions.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our agreement to resolve our conflict moves
                right away from the margins and into the mainstream. That is
                part of its uniqueness. It is that part which is most accessible
                and understood internationally, and by peoples in conflict
                everywhere. As Mary&nbsp;Robinson said,</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;That is why the world is interested in
                our agreement — why the world observes us.&quot;</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In working out and living through the
                purpose, potential and promotion-of-rights protection in our
                agreement in order to end the conflict, we might inform and
                inspire others to work out and live through their conflicts.
                That is how our experience is relevant for the people of Soweto.

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to bring to the attention of the
                Assembly the need for improved transportation links in east
                Antrim. There are urgent pressures for improving the main Larne
                to Belfast road, the A8, the main Carrickfergus to Belfast Road,
                the A2, the Larne-Carrickfergus-Belfast rail-link and the port
                of Larne.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The port of Larne has been designated as a
                major gateway to Northern Ireland in the &quot;Shaping our
                Future&quot; document. Larne-Cairnryan is the shortest sea
                crossing between Northern Ireland and Scotland, and is one of
                the busiest roll-on, roll-off ferry terminals in the United
                Kingdom. It also provides a container service to other mainland
                ports. It provides a highly efficient and frequent service, and
                is an essential umbilical cord for many of our manufacturing
                companies and their English, Scottish, Welsh and European
                customers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The port of Larne presently receives only
                50%&nbsp;grant aid. The trust ports such as Belfast and
                Londonderry receive grants of up to 75%. There must be a level
                playing field for fair competition to take place.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The main Larne-Belfast road is an essential
                part of the Dublin-Belfast-Glasgow/Carlisle trans-European
                network. There are several accident blackspots on that road —
                the Millbrook and Ballyloran junctions —which are costing
                lives on this key transportation route. Many houses have been
                built on the west side of the dual carriageway, and commuters
                find it difficult to cross because of the high levels of road
                traffic. The high-speed nature of accidents on the road has
                resulted in some fatalities this year. The latest non-fatal
                accident occurred only 13 days ago. This is an urgent safety
                problem which must be addressed with or without the help of the
                Chancellor’s package.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The ‘Shaping our Future’ document shows
                that 1,750 new houses are planned for Larne by the year 2010.
                This will add further pressures. The Belfast-Larne road — on
                the Belfast side of the Kilwaughter junction — becomes a
                single lane carriageway and offers no opportunities for
                overtaking. Our vital strategic transport link can be impeded by
                slow-moving vehicles on this single-lane trunk road.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Urgent safety issues need to be addressed at
                the Ballynure-Templepatrick junction where the road divides. The
                trans-European network continues to Belfast, and the other road
                carries traffic to Antrim and Londonderry. New housing
                developments at Ballynure have added to the pressure at this
                junction. Major safety improvements are urgently required.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall now deal with the Mallusk M2 slip
                road. The junction fails to carry the main commuter traffic. Two
                lanes on the M2 merge with two lanes from the Mallusk
                roundabout, and motorway traffic is frequently brought to a
                standstill. This causes a severe bottleneck that delays
                commuters and adds to the distribution costs of our companies. I
                urge an investigation into the design of that junction to devise
                a better method of maintaining traffic flow at peak periods.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The lack of improvements to the A2
                Belfast-to-Carrickfergus road is exasperating commuters and
                inhibiting industrial development in the Carrickfergus area.
                There is a dual carriageway from Carrickfergus town centre to
                Seapark. There is then single-lane traffic to the University of
                Ulster at Jordanstown, where there are two lanes of traffic in
                each direction. This bottleneck adds up to half an hour to
                journeys between Carrickfergus and Belfast during peak periods.
                This morning I met an ambulance coming against the traffic flow,
                and on such occasions, critical time is wasted.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am dissatisfied, as are other
                representatives in the area, with the recent ‘Moving Forward’
                document — a transport policy statement by the Department of
                the Environment. No reference was made in the document to the A2
                bottleneck at Greenisland. Why should Members care about the A2?
                Traffic is so heavy on the route that many travel five miles
                inland to join the Belfast-to-Larne route — joining the
                trans-European route and adding to the congestion at Mallusk.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the constituencies of North Antrim, South
                Antrim, Mid Ulster and even East&nbsp;Londonderry, the failure
                to upgrade the A2 is impinging on commuters and hauliers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of the Environment advised of
                a traffic movement increase of approximately one million
                kilometres per year — from 34 million in 1994 to 38 million in
                1998. It is predicted that this will lead to gridlock in Belfast
                in the next five to 10&nbsp;years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What suggestions to alleviate the problems in
                my constituency have been made in the ‘Moving Forward’
                document? None, I suggest. There is a suggestion of bus lanes,
                but as there is only one lane on the A2, how could a bus lane be
                provided?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is talk of the promotion of rail
                transport. The Belfast-to-Dublin and the Belfast-to-Bangor lines
                are being upgraded. Again, East Antrim has not been mentioned in
                the document. There is a need for the Belfast-Carrickfergus-Larne
                line to be upgraded. Bus and rail need to be upgraded.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was pleased to learn that Bangor station is
                being upgraded, but I must again ask when some money will be
                spent to upgrade the stations in my constituency and other parts
                of east Antrim. Only when funding is provided to upgrade the
                rail service in east Antrim will commuters choose to let the
                train take the strain. Proper car parking provision must also be
                provided at stations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I appreciate the commencement of improvements
                that are currently being carried out at the Carrick town
                bus/rail station car park. However, at present this purely
                involves putting tarmac on the car park and some security work.
                The station itself needs to be upgraded.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need a first-class service that can be
                relied upon to transport my constituents punctually and in
                comfort to their destinations. Why should other Members be
                interested in rail upgrading in east Antrim?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rail transportation is much more
                environmentally friendly, and I am pleased to hear that the

                East and West Belfast will already be aware of the high levels
                of asthma among young children, and using rail transport can
                help to reduce airborne pollution levels.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is also the issue of equality. The
                existing rail service in East Antrim is not sympathetic to
                either the elderly or disabled travellers. Access to stations
                and carriages needs to be upgraded to allow the less fortunate
                to use public transport.</p>

                East&nbsp;Antrim so that we may have improved safety, increased
                economic efficiency, an improvement to the environment in the

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is nothing worse than the failure of
                society to protect its most vulnerable people, and especially
                its children.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All too often in recent years each of us —
                regardless of financial standing, creed or class — has been
                disturbed and angered by the stories of children who have been
                abused by their families, trusted friends, neighbours or by
                those from whom one had a right to expect more — for example,
                teachers, youth leaders and the clergy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Each scandal tells a tale of young lives
                ruined by others, of adults who neglected children or subjected
                them to emotional, physical or sexual abuse. This presents each
                of us with a fundamental challenge. It asks us to define what we
                mean by a &quot;good society&quot;. But it is all too easy to
                point the finger at &quot;dangerous&quot; families, at
                &quot;dangerous&quot; adults, or at the &quot;monsters&quot; who
                prey on children.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are failing the children by the
                comfortable nature of our outrage. We condemn the families, the
                paedophiles and the social workers who are all too often damned
                if they do and damned if they do not. We are failing children by
                not ensuring that educational services genuinely tap into the
                potential of each child and by not ensuring that the range of
                services designed to protect children is doing just that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Children’s services are in crisis — a
                silent crisis — and attention will only be brought to that
                crisis when an incident happens. There will be outrage then, and
                people will ask &quot;What, how and when?&quot;</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Children Order 1996 was meant to signal a
                sea change in the way this issue was to be tackled. The
                so-called 5Ps are the ideas underpinning this Order. They are:
                the rights of the child are Paramount; Prevention — an
                injection of resources to try to support children safely in
                their families and their communities; Partnership — between
                all those concerned with protecting children; Permanency; and
                Participation — by children and families in any decision
                affecting their lives.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Community groups, political parties and
                childcare professionals alike welcomed this progressive piece of
                legislation. But for all of its high ideals, it has one Achilles
                heel, and that is, of course, a lack of resources in funding and
                personnel.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Government have shamefully underfunded
                this legislation, and health boards and trusts have colluded in
                this. They maintain to be meeting fully their moral and
                statutory duties under the Children’s Order, while at the same
                time everyone is concerned that the gross underfunding is
                putting children and families at greater risk.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have been speaking of a real and ongoing
                crisis in children’s services. Like other Members, I was
                invited to a conference on 30 November which was hosted by the
                Northern Ireland Public Service Alliance. It was called Crisis
                in Childcare. Those of us who attended were shocked at the scale
                of the crisis in children’s services. The most extreme
                examples can be found in residential childcare.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are cases of children who have been
                sexually abused sharing bedrooms with older people who have in
                the past been abusers. In one incident a child who was a victim
                of sexual abuse was admitted to a children’s home. While there
                the young person became the victim of an attempted rape. There
                are also examples of children, who have been removed from their
                homes because of family breakdowns, sharing accommodation with
                vulnerable people who have learning disabilities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Children who are suffering from mental
                illness are living in residential homes without having been
                assessed to see if they need specialised care. The level of
                overcrowding in residential homes is also unacceptable. Children
                are having to sleep on mattresses on the floor. As the problem
                continues to grow, staff are being placed under more and more
                pressure especially when trying to deal with difficult children.
                Staff also feel helpless and annoyed that they are not consulted
                about the children being admitted.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Such stories are a damning indictment of a
                Government which continues to ignore and cover up this problem.
                Children in residential care are not receiving the service that
                they deserve, and if the situation is not addressed, the problem
                will ripple on for generations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Kevin McCoy, a chief inspector of social
                services, said after visiting one such residential home that if
                the home had been run by the voluntary sector he would have
                closed it. Does this not beg a question? Reports have been
                written and money has been promised with the aim of giving full
                expression to the ideals in the Children Order. Planned
                investment in all areas is needed to make the partnership
                between statutory, voluntary and community groups a reality. The
                rights of the child must be paramount.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Equality&quot; seems to be the buzz
                word of the Assembly, and, having sat here for the past two
                days, I am not sure that there is anything left to say about it.
                Mr Initial Presiding Officer, given the two full days of debate,
                I am sure you and the Members will be quite pleased about that.
                Equality has also been addressed here before during an
                Adjournment debate. However, it was discussed from a different
                political background and from the point of view of a different
                gender. The political background may not be obvious, but I hope
                the gender is.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Gender is not an issue with me. I have little
                time for exclusively women’s groups, women in politics, women’s
                coalitions who cannot make up their mind whether they are
                political or not and women’s pressure groups. Perhaps the need
                to create a party exclusively for women indicates a lack of
                confidence or an inability to integrate in to an existing forum.
                It also creates inequality. I do not support quotas for women,
                places for women or — I heard of this recently — boxes for
                women. Who wants to be a female jack-in-the-box?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is more to equality than gender
                equality. It is an issue in sport. People are excluded from
                sporting activities because of their job and, more recently,
                because of their religion — a football match involving the
                Royal Ulster Constabulary was not allowed to be played even
                though the people behind its cancellation preach about equality
                to others.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Equality is an issue in the workplace. Last
                week I read a report suggesting that a minimum of 40% from one
                section of the community should be guaranteed a job in a
                particular workforce. It does not matter how this is achieved,
                just so long as it is achieved — there seems to be a new
                meaning for the word equality. Equality in the workplace should
                reflect ability to do the job, the qualifications required for
                the job, and relevant expertise and knowledge. Nothing else
                should matter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When I attend a conference or seminar it
                makes little difference to me who sits on the panel or who
                organises the workshop. If the subject matter is explained in
                simple, straightforward language, and I can drive home feeling
                more informed, I do not care whether the panel is made up of
                men, women or monkeys. What matters is that its members know
                their subject and be able to make things clear.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will there ever be equality in everyday life?
                Listening to Members speaking in Irish does not bother me, but I
                do not know what they are talking about. Is it equality when
                only 10% of Members know what is being debated and 90% are
                excluded?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Concise Oxford Dictionary defines
                equality as &quot;the state of being equal&quot;. Perhaps those
                who shout most about equality practise it least. One cannot and
                should not demand equality on one hand and seek special
                treatment on the other.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Northern Ireland some ordinary people will
                not allow other ordinary people to walk down the road they want
                to walk down. So much for equality.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Disabled people have not been entirely
                forgotten — perhaps just put on the back burner. I hope that
                more money will be made available to adapt housing to their
                needs. That process has already started, and I congratulate
                those who have worked hard to provide a comfortable home life
                for disabled people. There is much more to do in this area in
                respect of everyday activities such as getting out and about and
                going to the shops. There is also a need to attend to the lack
                of low kerbs and suitable transport. The list is endless. We
                could all agree on this issue because disability is no respecter
                of class, creed or colour.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is almost Christmas, the season of peace
                and goodwill to all. I look forward to 1999, when there will be
                equality for all the people who live, work and enjoy life in
                this part of our United Kingdom.</p>
