                (NIA 14/01) be agreed.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I said in relation to two earlier Bills,
                my Department is focused on updating our company and insolvency
                laws with a series of legislative measures designed to keep the
                legal framework for business in Northern Ireland at the
                forefront of best international practice.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Insolvency Bill is the latest important
                measure that I am bringing to this session of the Assembly. It
                will ensure that small companies here can use the same company
                rescue procedures as their competitors in Great Britain, thus
                removing any potential disadvantages to local business.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It might be helpful for Members who are
                unfamiliar with company voluntary arrangements (CVAs) if I
                explain the current CVA procedures, their main drawbacks and the
                improvements that will be brought about by the Bill. The CVA
                procedure is a means for companies in financial difficulty to
                reach a legally-binding agreement with their creditors in
                satisfaction of their debts. A proposal will typically involve
                payment of a reduced sum to each creditor or payment over an
                extended period. There must be a majority vote of at least 75%
                in favour at separate meetings of a company’s creditors and
                members for a proposal to be approved. Once it has been
                approved, it becomes legally binding on everyone entitled to
                vote at the meetings, provided they were given notice that the
                vote was taking place.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the current procedure has several
                drawbacks. First, insolvency proceedings can be commenced while
                the proposals are being put together, thus thwarting the
                attempts to enter a voluntary arrangement. Secondly, not all
                creditors may be bound by the agreement. Finally, there has been
                a low uptake of the CVA procedure locally — about six cases a
                year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If more successful rescues are to be
                achieved, change to the existing legislation is required.
                Measures that will enable companies to return to a sound
                financial footing will benefit everyone who could be adversely
                affected by a company’s getting into financial difficulties.
                Jobs saved, the dangers of cash flow problems for suppliers
                reduced and communities continuing to benefit from continuing
                spending power are very positive alternatives to outright
                closure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill aims to make company rescues more
                accessible to small companies here by extending to them the
                choice of availing of a short moratorium. Such a moratorium
                would give small companies in financial difficulties a breathing
                space free from creditor pressure to consult an appropriately
                qualified expert to see if a successful rescue package could be
                put together, and, if so, to prepare one for consideration at
                meetings of the company and its creditors.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proposed new procedures will be available
                in addition to the existing CVA procedure that will continue to
                be used where a moratorium is unnecessary. Under current
                legislation, a moratorium is provided only for insolvent
                individuals. The proposed change will mean that small companies
                will no longer be at a competitive disadvantage.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To sum up, the intention of the Bill is to
                bring Northern Ireland into line with the system in Great
                Britain following amendments to the Insolvency Act 1986 made by
                the Insolvency Act 2000. In so doing, it will introduce the
                option of a short moratorium for small companies that will give
                them time, free from the threat of immediate creditor
                proceedings, to attempt to set up a voluntary arrangement. That
                is a significant step that provides a remedy against a voluntary
                arrangement’s being thwarted, for example, by a single
                creditor, to the detriment of the other company creditors, and
                it is legally binding on all creditors. These improvements will
                result in an increased uptake of the CVA procedures, and
                Northern Ireland will benefit as a consequence.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, the provisions of the Insolvency
                Bill are important advances that have been generally welcomed by
                insolvency professionals. That reflects the Bill’s
                non-controversial nature, the fact that it is attempting to
                remedy drawbacks in the system and the fact that it is seen to
                be helping to create conditions in which otherwise viable
                businesses can continue to develop and expand.</p>

                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Department is focused on updating our
                company insolvency laws with a series of legislative measures,
                and the Company Directors Disqualification Bill is the final
                measure that I am bringing to this session of the Assembly. It
                is an important measure that goes towards meeting my Department’s
                commitment to keep the legal framework for business here at the
                forefront of best international practice. The Bill will ensure
                that we have up-to-date law to deal with the problem of unfit
                directors, and it will provide a means of preventing such
                individuals from acting as directors for a period commensurate
                with the degree of their unfitness.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It might be helpful if I explain to Members
                the current position and the improvements that the new Bill will
                introduce. It is widely known that the status of limited
                liability affords a special privilege — namely, that directors
                of a company are not, in the main, liable for that company’s
                debts. Disqualification for unfitness is a means of protecting
                consumers, and the public generally, from those who would abuse
                the system of limited liability and also from those who, while
                not deliberately abusing it, have shown themselves unfit through
                incompetence.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Under the present system a person can only be
                disqualified from acting as a director for a limited liability
                company by means of a court order. That order is normally made
                by the High Court on the application of my Department in cases
                where the company has become insolvent and the insolvency
                practitioner in charge of the insolvency, or the official
                receiver in the case of compulsory liquidation, has submitted a
                report alleging unfit conduct.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill seeks to introduce a new method of
                disqualification. It is disqualification by consent, without the
                involvement of the court, where there is evidence of unfitness
                on the part of a director and where that director is not
                disputing his or her unfitness. In such cases, the Department
                will be able to accept a statutorily-based undertaking from the
                director not to act as a director for a specific period. That
                undertaking will have the same basis in law as if it had been a
                disqualification order made by the court. Any breach of the
                undertaking will have the same effect as contravention of a
                court order: namely, it will be a criminal offence and can lead
                to personal liability for the debts of a company. Those
                sanctions would not apply under the current system were a
                director to offer an undertaking in lieu of the matter going to
                a hearing in court. In addition, an undertaking given under the
                new system will be entered in the register of disqualification
                orders and undertakings. Any undertaking given under the current
                system could not have been so entered.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill also provides for details of all
                orders made and undertakings given in Northern Ireland to be
                sent to the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry for
                inclusion in a UK-wide register of disqualification orders and
                undertakings. That is important in ensuring that details of all
                disqualification orders and undertakings are disseminated as
                widely as possible in the interest of protecting the consumer
                and the public.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As well as the advantages that I have
                outlined, the new system will have three other significant
                advantages. First, there will be a saving for the director in
                legal costs, as there will no longer be an award of the
                Department’s costs against him. Secondly, there will be a
                saving in court time, as it will no longer be dealing with
                uncontested cases where the director has indicated his intention
                to accept that he will be found unfit, or where he is
                introducing evidence solely in mitigation with the intention of
                justifying a short period of disqualification. Thirdly, it will
                result in a speeding-up of processing time in uncontested or
                mitigation-only cases.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The provisions in the Bill will not, however,
                mean that a director will be put under pressure to accept
                disqualification rather than defend his reputation in court.
                Whether or not he accepts the Department’s allegations of
                unfitness, he may still choose to allow a court to adjudicate on
                the basis of the evidence. Equally, he may at any time after
                filing the proceedings in court, seek to make an undertaking.
                The Department may, in those circumstances, withdraw the
                proceedings with a consequent saving in costs to the director
                and in court time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The intention of the Bill is to bring
                Northern Ireland into line with the system applying in Great
                Britain, following amendments to the Company Directors
                Disqualification Act 1986 made by the Insolvency Act 2000. In so
                doing, it introduces in particular the option of a voluntary
                disqualification by a legally enforceable undertaking. That
                represents a significant step forward, by simplifying the whole
                procedure; by the provision of undertakings to be entered in a
                public register to protect consumers and the public; and by
                saving the director his or her legal costs. Those represent
                important advances that are also generally welcomed by
                insolvency practitioners.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That, I believe, reflects the
                non-controversial nature of the Bill and the fact that it
                applies a common-sense approach to the practicalities of the
                disqualification procedure.</p>

                to deliver Northern Ireland’s contribution to the targets in
                the air quality strategy for England, Scotland, Wales and
                Northern Ireland. That requires the establishment of a statutory
                scheme affecting the relevant parties.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill, therefore, places a range of
                statutory requirements on district councils and relevant
                authorities that will be prescribed by forthcoming Regulations.
                Those statutory requirements are dictated by the
                responsibilities in the control of the various agencies and by
                what is required to satisfy the Directive and deliver compliance
                with the air quality strategy objectives.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill requires that the Department draw
                up, on its own or in conjunction with other United Kingdom
                Administrations, an air quality strategy. It places a duty on
                district councils to conduct reviews and assessments of local
                air quality — a process that all 26 district councils are
                already voluntarily engaged in. The Bill provides for the
                declaration by district councils of air quality management areas
                and the establishment of action plans indicating the measures to
                be taken where there is a risk of air quality standards or
                objectives being exceeded.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill also requires relevant authorities
                to provide information and produce proposals to secure necessary
                improvements in air quality relating to the activities under
                their control. It will allow the Department of the Environment
                to provide financial assistance for air quality review
                assessment or management activities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Research has shown that poor air quality can
                exacerbate respiratory and heart conditions. For that reason,
                the production of the Bill is one of the Executive’s ‘Investing
                for Health’ targets, and recent research, which included
                Belfast, indicated that poorer air quality is frequently found
                in socially deprived areas. The Bill is, therefore, likely to
                most significantly improve air quality for those who live and
                work in socially deprived areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of the Environment carried out
                a full public consultation in late 2001; approximately 500
                organisations and individuals were consulted. They included the
                Committee for the Environment, MLAs, departmental statutory
                bodies, the relevant environmental bodies, district councils and
                other relevant organisations, including minority groups.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department is content that the majority
                of the issues raised are satisfactorily dealt with by the
                legislation. Of the remaining issues, four were rejected —
                they related to the promotion of fuel types, which is not within
                the remit of the Bill — but the suggestions regarding enhanced
                public access to information were incorporated. The Bill will
                bring environmental and health benefits to people in Northern
                Ireland.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr A Doherty:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have difficulty in breathing, even when the
                air is pure. Therefore, I know better than many how important it
                is to stop poisoning the air, not only so that we can enjoy life
                but also so that we can go on living. The alarming increase in
                the number of old people dying from respiratory problems cannot
                be ignored, and even more frightening is the ever-increasing
                number of young people suffering from asthma. The millions of
                tonnes of toxic chemicals that are pumped into the air daily may
                not be the only cause of this, but it would be criminally
                irresponsible not to admit that they must be a factor, as well
                as being the major cause of global warming and climate change.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I approve of and support legislation that is
                aimed at improving and managing air quality. People have shown
                that, if left alone, they are not too interested in keeping the
                air clean, or are too greedy to do so.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The name of the Local Air Quality Management
                Bill is a bit of a joke, but not much of a laugh. There is no
                such thing as local air. Our air is everybody’s air and
                everybody’s air is our air. Events at Chernobyl and Sellafield
                have taught us that. We cannot build a peace wall 20 miles high
                to keep clean air in and dirty air out.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must ensure that the air that we are
                responsible for is as clean as we can make it. The Bill makes
                district councils responsible for the air in their districts,
                which is OK if with that responsibility come the resources and
                powers to fulfil their duties effectively. I am worried about
                that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clauses 3, 4 and 5 empower district councils
                to carry out reviews, to make assessments, to designate areas,
                to make further assessments, to prepare reports and action
                plans, to revise their action plans and to send the Department
                and each relevant authority a copy of their finally determined
                plans. To what end? Clause 6 will give the Department reserve
                powers to turn on its head everything a council has done.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Time does not allow me to go into details,
                but they are set out in subsections (1) to (7). Subsection (7)
                is the sting in the tail, as it requires the district council to
                comply with any direction given to it under the legislation.
                That may seem a necessary safeguard to ensure compliance with
                international treaties and agreements, to ensure consistency of
                action and to deal with incompetent councils, if there are any.
                That is understandable, and it is even acceptable if carried out
                with some tact or finesse. However, there seems to be nothing in
                the legislation that allows for councils to appeal a decision or
                direction. In cross-cutting issues where two or more Departments
                have a difference of opinion about some requirements of the
                Bill, the relevant Ministers can put their heads together and
                reach a gentleperson’s agreement. I may be wrong, but councils
                seem to have no facility for arguing or defending their actions
                if they feel that their action plans are reasonable and workable
                in their circumstances, but the Department thinks differently.
                Will the Minister reassure me that I am wrong in that
                assumption?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ford:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the broad provisions of the Bill,
                but I would like to pose one or two questions to the Minister on
                matters that do not appear to have been dealt with in full.
                First, clause 2(6) appears to suggest that the Department of the
                Environment will have authority over other Departments. Perhaps
                the Minister could explain how that authority will be exercised,
                if the interpretation is that the Department of the Environment
                will have the right to tell other Departments and authorities
                what to do.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clause 5(8) makes an interesting reference to
                a disagreement between a district council and a relevant
                authority, yet it does not spell out how that disagreement is
                defined. Reference is made earlier in clause 5 to the council’s
                contribution towards any action plan and submissions from other
                relevant authorities, but it does not say that the council has
                the right to vet the decisions of other authorities. I suspect
                that other Departments will be reluctant for councils to tell
                them what to do. However, it talks about registering a
                disagreement and the matter then being adjudicated by the
                Department of the Environment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We might find that the combined activity of
                private motorists and the Department for Regional Development’s
                Roads Service is a major source of air pollution. Will the
                council be authorised to tell the Roads Service what to do, in
                that case? I doubt if that will be acceptable. Will the
                Department of the Environment then have the power to step in, or
                will we see some kind of back-room deal between two Ministers? A
                gentleperson’s agreement may be satisfactory, but if it is
                arrived at behind closed doors without the knowledge of the
                district council responsible for drawing up the action plan,
                that is not the transparent, open Government that we are
                supposed to be looking forward to. The Minister and his
                officials will have to address that in some detail now or at
                Committee Stage.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was also fascinated by some of the
                definitions. In clause 19 I made the amazing discovery that
                &quot;air&quot; means ambient air, which is perhaps simple
                enough until a few definitions later we discover that
                &quot;ambient air&quot; means outdoor air in the troposphere.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is news to me, since I was not sure that
                the entire troposphere came under the responsibility of the
                Northern Ireland Assembly. I presume that it refers to the part
                of the troposphere that is vertically above the land area of
                Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There seems to be a contradiction in the
                concept of promoting air quality, yet excluding open-air
                workplaces. We all know the problems that can arise — for
                example, the nuisance that can be caused to neighbours by
                quarrying operations. Is the Minister saying that anything that
                arises from an industrial process such as quarrying does not
                affect air quality? That issue should be addressed in detail.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since the House is so engrossed in the Bill,
                I do not wish to detain it for too long. Schedule 1 refers to
                consultation. It may be that that section of the Bill has been
                lifted from the equivalent Westminster legislation, but there is
                a particular issue in Northern Ireland that does not apply in
                Great Britain. There may be district councils, or perhaps county
                councils</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;whose district is contiguous to the
                council’s district&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">— in the words of schedule 1(2)(b) — but
                which are under another jurisdiction in the form of the Republic
                of Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Without going as far as Chernobyl, as Arthur
                Doherty did, if we are to do anything about tackling air quality
                we should at least look at whether there are North/South issues
                where air quality in the North can affect the Republic and vice
                versa. I trust that the Minister will be able to reassure us,
                and I promise him that we will have an interesting Committee
                Stage on that issue.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Nesbitt:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Two Members have spoken on the Bill, which is
                a little more than Sir Reg Empey had on the Bills that he
                sponsored this morning. It is similar to the number of Members
                who spoke on a Statutory Rule that I brought to the House
                yesterday, and it is 100% more than what Dr Farren had
                yesterday, so we are getting a light load on the Second Stage
                debates. Perhaps I am filibustering until I get my papers
                organised.</p>
                <b>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister’s honesty is commendable.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Nesbitt:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that it will be noted and underlined
                that my honesty pervades the Chamber, even when I am outside.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the two Members who commented. My
                officials will scrutinise Hansard, and if I overlook any aspects
                in the detail of what was said, they will write to the Members
                accordingly. Mr Ford said that there would be &quot;an
                interesting Committee Stage&quot;. I look forward to
                constructive intercourse between the Committee, the Department
                and myself, as has been the case in the Committee Stages of
                other Bills.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Arthur Doherty referred to respiratory
                problems and local air. It is not only local air, it can be
                wider, which is a point that was made by Mr Ford when he
                referred to North/South issues and those aspects that we need to
                address, and district councils’ designation of areas for
                action plans.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Doherty addressed a key point when he
                asked &quot;To what end?&quot; He said that the Department of
                the Environment will have the power to do what it wishes. His
                implication was that the Department would overturn those aspects
                negatively. I assure Mr Doherty that any direction that would
                come from the Department would be positive. It would be a
                direction to do those things that a council would be meant to be
                doing, if it were not doing them. That is important because we
                view this aspect of highlighting problems and areas of action
                plans as important. The environmental health departments of
                district councils are the key drivers of that aspect of air
                quality.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Madam Deputy Speaker [Ms Morrice] in the
                Chair)</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ford asked about authority over other
                Departments, and about that issue being addressed at Committee
                Stage. A requirement of the proposed legislation is that
                district councils will submit proposals for action plans, which
                have been mentioned. Departments are committed to air quality
                strategies. However, on a practical level, should any Department
                fail to fulfil its statutory duties, the matter will be resolved
                bilaterally between Ministers, or by the Executive in their
                final analysis. If a Department has failed to discharge its
                duty, the High Court — on the application of a relevant
                authority — could declare that to be unlawful as an act of
                omission. Relevant authorities will be prescribed in the
                forthcoming legislation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Consultation on the North/South issue needs
                to be addressed, as Mr Ford indicated. The problem is not so
                much trans-boundary, but more localised. However, I accept that
                the strategy in which the Department is involved is a UK-wide
                strategy. Air quality is not localised. As always, co-operation
                will be needed to deliver on that strategy. As part of the first
                stage of the review and reassessment process, councils that are
                adjacent to the border have considered, neighbouring sources of
                air pollution across the border. In all cases, that review has
                shown that those sources have no significant effect on local air
                quality and, therefore, do not need to be considered much
                further.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have covered the points raised by both
                Members. If any details have not been covered, Department of the
                Environment officials will scrupulously scrutinise Hansard, and
                those details will be provided. It is my firm belief that the
                Bill is necessary in order to transpose EU Directives, to
                satisfy the Executive’s Programme for Government, and to
                invest in better health and ambience for the environment.
                However, it will also benefit the entire Northern Ireland
                public. Therefore, I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

                of the Committee for Social Development on their inquiry into
                Housing in Northern Ireland (Homelessness) (3/01/R) and calls on
                the Executive to consider the report and arrange for the
                implementation of the Committee’s recommendations at the
                earliest opportunity.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report deals with the serious and, I
                regret to say, growing problem of homelessness. The latest
                figures available for the Committee’s inquiry relate to
                2000-01, at which time 12,694 households presented as homeless.
                Within the past week, the Northern Ireland Housing Executive has
                released figures for 2001-02 that show a 10% increase on last
                year’s figure. That means that more than 14,000 households
                presented as homeless. That the trend continues upwards rather
                than downwards should concern everyone in the Assembly. We
                should also be alarmed at the increasing trend of young people
                who are presenting as homeless.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Homelessness is a serious social, economic,
                health and education issue. How can we, as locally elected
                representatives, stand over policies that patently fail to
                reverse the increasing trends of homelessness? We are always on
                the lookout for good news stories, and we can be proud of the
                many achievements that have come from the establishment and
                operation of a local Assembly. By the same token, we should be
                thoroughly ashamed that we are responsible for failing the
                vulnerable and needy in society.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no denying that the homeless fall
                into that category. I doubt whether anyone is more needy than
                the person without a home, yet the report shows that levels of
                homelessness are on the increase. As I have said, more and more
                young people are homeless. We must ask what we are doing about
                that. We talk about promoting social inclusion and claim to be
                targeting social need, but where are the actions behind those
                fine words and rhetoric?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee is bringing an important issue
                to the House’s attention. Homelessness deserves to be on the
                political agenda. It is a complex problem that is not simply
                about bricks and mortar or a place to live; it is about
                providing support services, and identifying new solutions and
                models of good practice.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank my fellow Committee members for
                taking their responsibilities seriously while the inquiry was
                under way. The evidence of those efforts is contained in the
                report. On behalf of the Committee, I express our gratitude to
                everyone who submitted written and oral evidence. We are also
                grateful to staff in the Committee office for their services
                during the inquiry. Research and Library Service staff also
                warrant a mention for their comprehensive and helpful briefing
                papers. I also acknowledge the staff in Hansard for recording
                the oral evidence sessions and those responsible for the
                printing, publication and distribution of the report.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The real praise, however, is for those on the
                ground. The Northern Ireland Housing Executive, the health
                boards and trusts, the Probation Board for Northern Ireland, and
                the specialist organisations in the voluntary and community
                sector are all doing what they can to tackle homelessness.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I pay credit to them for that, but we must do
                more, and we must do it better. We must show political will and
                leadership. We all owe a duty of care to the vulnerable and the
                needy. We must show commitment, especially to a joined-up
                approach that is more geared to prevention. However, we must
                also put in place whatever resources are necessary to tackle the
                problem, so that we can provide for the homeless and reduce the
                number of people who find themselves homeless.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have called for new housing legislation
                almost since we first set foot in the Chamber after power was
                devolved more than two years ago, but, as the mandate for the
                Assembly runs out, the housing Bill has still not been
                introduced.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are promised that it will reach the House
                next week. It is my hope that the Bill will give us the platform
                and the tools to deal with such issues as homelessness. Although
                the Committee for Social Development has waited patiently for
                the legislation, its members have not sat on their hands. The
                report on the first phase of the inquiry into housing in
                Northern Ireland was published in November 2001.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee did not stop there. The second
                phase, which was put together over the last six months, contains
                22 recommendations. It reveals that homelessness is on the
                increase, identifies the absence of a proper preventative
                strategy and is a damning indictment of our promises to help the
                vulnerable and the needy. It highlights the need for
                improvements in the way we do things. Most importantly, it
                confirms that homelessness is not just about bricks and mortar.
                It is much more complex than that. Evidence of the critical need
                to provide a range of support services for the homeless was
                overwhelming. Being homeless can seriously damage health, and
                prevention is better than cure. Those are facts. If we are
                serious about tackling homelessness we must ensure that
                sufficient resources are available to provide the necessary
                support services, and that there is a workable strategy to
                reduce and prevent it. Homelessness will not go away unless and
                until something is done about it. We must match our fine words
                with actions and ensure that the money is available to fund
                those actions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not privy to how the Executive reach
                their decisions; however, I call on the Minister of Health,
                Social Services and Public Safety, the Minister of Education and
                the Minister for Employment and Learning, as those responsible
                for the health and well-being, and the education and training of
                our young people, to work with the Minister for Social
                Development to tackle the problem of homelessness in a more
                co-ordinated way. They must wake up to the fact that they too
                have a role to play.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Colleagues on the Committee will deal with
                the report in detail and will draw attention to the main areas
                considered and the recommendations made. I shall, however, be
                surprised and disappointed if other Members do not speak in this
                debate. I hope that my Colleagues on the Committee for Health,
                Social Services and Public Safety, the Committee for Education
                and the Committee for Employment and Learning will rise to the
                challenge of ensuring an effective and co-ordinated
                interdepartmental and interagency approach. I hope that the
                relevant Ministers will be called to account and asked what
                commitments they are prepared to make and what actions they are
                prepared to take in tackling homelessness. All of us have a
                moral obligation to help those who are disadvantaged. Let us not
                lose sight of that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee for Social Development has at
                least done something by bringing the report to the Assembly’s
                attention. I commend it to all Members, but that is not the end
                of the process. I hope that the report will return housing to
                the political agenda, where it belongs. The Committee’s work
                throughout the inquiry places it in an informed position, and
                that work will stand it in good stead in the scrutiny of the
                housing Bill and the housing support services Bill.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr ONeill:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the report and thank the
                Chairperson of the Committee for Social Development for leading
                the Committee through a very difficult and sometimes
                overwhelming exercise. The amount of evidence received from
                various sources was remarkable. The Committee is indebted to
                those who gave their time and expertise in assisting with the
                report’s compilation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the Committee Chairperson said,
                homelessness is a spiralling problem. All of us have noticed it
                growing incrementally, year-on-year, at an unacceptable rate.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.15 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The most recent figures, which the
                Chairperson announced this morning, show that this year there
                has been a 10% increase on last year’s huge increase of 15%.
                We must do something definite and dramatic to halt the increase,
                and much of the Committee’s work, which is contained in the
                recommendations, will help to do that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rural homelessness is one of the most
                difficult problems to deal with. Homelessness is increasing in
                rural areas, but, perhaps because of ill-placed pride or fear of
                ridicule, people will not reveal the true levels. Sensitive,
                direct policies are needed to deal with such issues. It is a
                difficult nut to crack, especially in rural areas where there is
                insufficient temporary accommodation. In urban areas,
                considerable steps are taken to provide temporary accommodation;
                that is not the case in rural areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Bed-and-breakfast accommodation is plentiful
                in Newcastle, and, in my experience, it is offered as the last
                resort for homeless people in rural areas. Homeless people come
                to my constituency office in Newcastle, and one pathetic case
                stands out in my memory. A single mother with three young
                children was living in bed-and-breakfast accommodation. They had
                breakfast in the morning and were then required to leave the
                premises and walk the streets of Newcastle until bedtime. That
                is unacceptable and uncivilised, but it is a solution in areas
                that cannot provide quality temporary accommodation for homeless
                people. The problem must be addressed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Homelessness among young people is more
                poignant and takes many forms. Homelessness depends on
                individuals, families and their circumstances, so it cannot be
                generalised. That is especially true for young people. There are
                many areas to consider. For example, a Committee debate, which
                is reflected in recommendation 4, raised concerns about the
                deteriorating quality of family life and the need for a family
                to be a caring unit to sustain people in need.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must protect the family unit. However,
                that argument has another side. Homelessness among young people
                is often caused by family break-up and disruption, and abuse in
                the home. It is a delicate area that has two distinct arguments,
                which the Committee has addressed in recommendations 3 to 8.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee was unanimous about the need
                for interagency support for young people leaving care and for
                young people who are already in care. It is crucial that the
                Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety address
                this matter. The Chairperson has already mentioned that
                homelessness among young people has many dimensions and that
                other Departments, including the Department of Education, have
                roles to play.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have been a local representative and a
                councillor for several years, and I am used to hearing about
                young people who leave care and are allocated Housing Executive
                flats. The neighbours then start to complain about parties and
                antisocial behaviour in the flat. That is a big problem.
                Research shows that young people leaving care have often had no
                love and support. When they move into a flat, they have no
                coping skills. To replace the love that they have missed out on,
                they look for the attention of contemporaries, who can make them
                feel popular, by inviting them to parties. It is a substitute
                for something that they have never had. All kinds of antisocial
                behaviour can stem from such a situation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Support must be available for those young
                people when they are in care, when they are preparing to leave
                care and after they have left care. The Minister of Health,
                Social Services and Public Safety has introduced the Children
                (Leaving Care) Bill, which will give a support mechanism that
                the Committee welcomes. However, more needs to be done to help
                those young people before they leave care. As an educationist, I
                know that certain aptitudes such as budgeting, hygiene and
                relationship skills can be taught. A life skills programme has
                existed for many years, so all those resources should be used to
                try to solve the problem.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the report as it is published, but
                I reserve judgement on one matter. I have misgivings about the
                concept of intentional homelessness which affects young people
                in particular, and whether young people who present themselves
                as homeless can be placed on a priority list. There was a
                pointed issue about the legislative position of the Housing
                Executive and its ability to deal with that. The Committee
                agreed to proceed rather than hold up the report, but with the
                proviso that I reserve judgement on that issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The legislative position covers certain
                matters. To be considered as priority, 16- or 17-year-olds must
                fit into one of six categories. They must be pregnant; have a
                dependent child or children; be at risk of sexual or financial
                exploitation; be vulnerable as a result of a mental or physical
                disability or for any other special reason; be subject to or at
                risk of violence; or be homeless as a result of an emergency
                such as a fire, flood or other disaster.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those criteria define the Housing Executive’s
                legislative competencies to investigate the circumstances.
                However, most young people who are homeless do not fall into
                those categories and are not considered as priority. I am
                putting a marker down on this — Mr Cobain is smiling at me —
                and I will return to it when we are consulting on the Bill, when
                it will be important.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Homelessness Act 2002 in England is a
                more modern Act than the Bill we are about to deal with. The
                housing magazine, the ‘Adviser’, of May/June 2002 stated
                that</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Not included in the 2002 Act, but
                contained in a draft order intended to come into effect when the
                body of the homeless reform is enacted, is an extension of the
                categories of priority need in s 189 of the 1996 Act. …
                Brought within the scope of this section are applicants who are:
                16- and 17-years-old; care leavers aged between 18 and 21;
                vulnerable as a result of either being looked after,
                accommodated or fostered by a local authority, having been in
                the armed forces or in prison; vulnerable as a result of ceasing
                to occupy accommodation following violence or threats of
                violence.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is an example of the more generous
                provision made in the Homelessness Act 2002 to cope with the
                problem, and we should follow that example to deal not just with
                the young homeless, but with every aspect of homelessness.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the fact that homelessness has
                moved up the agenda and is being debated here today. I
                acknowledge the many hours worked by the Committee staff and
                their successful compilation of the many documents and drafts
                involved in making the report. I also thank the agencies that

                that homelessness affects a sizeable number of people, and there
                is a higher rate of homelessness here than anywhere else in the
                UK. Housing Executive statistics for 2000-01 have revealed an
                increase of 15·5% in households presenting themselves as
                homeless. That is extremely worrying and confirms that
                homelessness should, and must, be taken seriously — we cannot
                simply tolerate it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Poverty in society, coupled with the gradual
                erosion and breakdown of the family unit has forced many
                individuals, especially young people, into a state of
                dispossession and homelessness. Youth homelessness has increased
                by 15% in the last four years. Northern Ireland, undoubtedly,
                has an invisible community of dispossessed and poverty-stricken
                people who go unnoticed, and the sheer magnitude of the
                situation is illustrated by the following figures: there were
                12,700 homeless households in Northern Ireland last year;
                families with children represented 41% of that total; 56% were
                placed temporarily in bed-and-breakfast accommodation; and the
                average length of stay there was 131 days.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Families and individuals who find themselves
                homeless are very often caught in a vicious circle of poverty
                and deprivation, and it becomes increasingly difficult to break
                out of that cycle. Being homeless is much more than not having a
                roof over your head. The impact of homelessness is appalling.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It leads to exclusion from society and
                creates barriers to access. For example, if someone has no job,
                he cannot get a bank account and, therefore, he cannot get
                credit. That can lead to exclusion from health services and
                education. Homeless people are one of the most vulnerable groups
                in society.</p>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a Member for South Belfast, many
                constituents who need help to secure permanent accommodation
                have contacted my office. I have dealt with homeless families
                who have had to move into bed-and-breakfast accommodation, often
                having to move out of the areas that they are familiar with.
                This has an extremely negative impact and often leads to
                instability in the families. Bed-and-breakfast accommodation
                should be a temporary measure, but, as I said, the average stay
                is 131 days. That is unacceptable and begs the question: how
                urgently is housing need met?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Legislation on homelessness came into effect
                in April 1989 in the form of the Housing (Northern Ireland)
                Order 1988. There is obviously a need for that legislation to be
                reviewed, and I welcome the Housing Executive’s review of its
                strategy on homelessness. The major strength of the current
                arrangement is that a statutory duty is placed on the Housing
                Executive to deal with those who are homeless. The Housing
                Executive has a fundamental role to play and in its review has
                consulted widely with other concerned organisations, such as the
                Simon Community and Shelter, which have been working to address
                those issues for many years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One problem that has been identified is that
                the Housing Executive, the many voluntary agencies and the
                Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety have had
                their own approaches and have worked independently. If the
                growing problem of homelessness is to be tackled effectively, a
                collective, inter-agency approach must be adopted. The Housing
                Executive has said that working alongside other agencies, both
                statutory and voluntary, is</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;crucial to achieving success in
                planning and developing accommodation advice and support
                services, with the overall aim of finding flexible efficient
                solutions to homelessness.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This universal approach would prevent
                confusion and needless referrals and stop people getting lost in
                the system. It would also lead to a sharing of information, with
                relevant agencies having access to it. That would create a more
                effective and practical system and reduce needless and endless
                red tape. It would also enable service providers to seek
                accommodation best suited to the needs of the individual.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Homelessness requires much more than a 9.00
                am-to 5.00 pm, Monday-to-Friday approach, which is why great
                importance has been placed on the development and co-ordination
                of a strong and effective out-of-hours service based on an
                integrated approach.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must examine the causes of homelessness
                and introduce measures to reduce the current level, so we must
                also examine the availability of affordable housing. The Housing
                Executive must take account of the fact that there will always
                be some who cannot afford to buy a house and seek to strike a
                balance between the housing stock that it intends to sell and
                the building of social housing. In effect, the Housing Executive
                must ensure that it has properly examined the supply-and-demand
                chain. Fewer than 2,000 social housing units are being built by
                housing associations each year, while there is an annual loss of
                over 4,000 Housing Executive properties, so it is obvious that
                supply is falling short of demand, and urgent changes must be
                made to accommodate the demand for social housing. Demand for
                social housing must never be found wanting.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is imperative that increased priority be
                given to dealing with homelessness and adequate funding
                allocated to bring about the required changes. We must not
                underestimate the role of voluntary organisations in supporting
                the most vulnerable in society, two of which, the Simon
                Community and Shelter, have worked in the most difficult
                circumstances for years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that as a result of today’s debate,
                positive action will be taken on funding to underpin the
                implementation process and, in the longer term, the programme
                delivery.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs E Bell:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the report; it is a valuable and
                timely piece of work. Last year in Parliament Buildings there
                was a presentation on homelessness by young people who had been
                in care or who had been homeless. It certainly demonstrated the
                unacceptable level of young people who have left home for a
                number of reasons — the break up of their parents’
                relationship, the loss of a job, the death of a parent, and, of
                course, intimidation, to name but a few.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those young people gave a wonderful insight
                into how a co-ordinated strategy can help young people. At that
                time, it was estimated that over 2,000 young people under the
                age of 16 had left home during the previous year, and, as others
                have said, the number is increasing. That is totally
                unacceptable — words that will be used more and more in the
                debate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another unacceptable fact is that Northern
                Ireland is the worst region for homelessness in the UK. People
                — and some of them are actually in Government — obviously
                feel that we do not have the same problem as there is in London,
                Dublin, or elsewhere because we do not see large numbers of
                street dwellers. In those cities you can actually walk over
                people in the streets at any time of the day or night. That
                opinion is definitely not the case: we do have that problem. As
                another Member said, homeless people are hidden, but they are
                there. A visit to the Simon Community, Shelter, the Council for
                the Homeless, the Northern Ireland Housing Executive or the
                Probation Board for Northern Ireland would soon put people right
                on that point. I want to take the opportunity to place on record
                my party’s appreciation of the organisations that work with
                the homeless in Northern Ireland, including my organisation, the
                Probation Board for Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is clearly established under the Universal
                Declaration of Human Rights that people have the right to a
                safe, secure, and permanent roof over their heads. That requires
                a co-ordinated approach by all relevant Departments — Health,
                Social Services and Public Safety; Employment and Learning; and
                Education — along with the relevant organisations which work
                directly with the homeless, such as the Northern Ireland Housing
                Executive and the other bodies I have mentioned. The report
                clearly indicates and supports that co-ordinated approach.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A constantly developing strategy is needed to
                deal effectively and practically with the problems facing people
                with no fixed abode. I agree with the Committee that
                homelessness is a serious social and economic issue that must be
                given the highest priority.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fact that the number of homeless people
                is increasing reflects badly on our society, and the Assembly
                must take that on board. We must all play our part in supporting
                the eradication of homelessness, and ensuring that proper
                legislation is passed to define the joined-up approach that can
                achieve that goal. As the Committee stated, this will give a
                much higher profile and sharper focus within the political
                context. I agree with other Members who said that it is not just
                a question of putting a roof over people’s heads, and that is
                why we need a joined-up approach.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Northern Ireland Housing Executive,
                together with the Departments, can be the leader in improving
                the situation in association with homeless organisations. The
                Northern Ireland Housing Executive must also be to the forefront
                in redefining homelessness, and our own Executive would do well
                to note the Committee’s suggestion that the definition of
                homelessness could be the absence of a safe and accessible place
                to stay. Mr ONeill touched on the problem of people being
                intentionally homeless. I support his comments, having witnessed
                much of that. A person presenting as homeless should be
                guaranteed housing promptly. There should be a review of hostel
                accommodation, including specially designed emergency and/or
                permanent housing for all — especially the young.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr ONeill related a story about emergency
                placements in his area, and every Member could give examples of
                that. Only last week a woman with two young children contacted
                me. The children are educated in Bangor and the woman works in
                Bangor, but she was told that they would have to go to Portadown
                or Newcastle to live. Schools and employment were not taken into
                account because there is a lack of suitable temporary
                accommodation in north Down.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Scotland and Westminster have adopted
                legislation providing for a strategy to deal with homelessness
                that focuses on prevention. The duty to relocate is enforced in
                that legislation. I also commend the Irish ‘Homelessness –
                an Integrated Strategy’, which has recommended that the
                employment services appoint a person specifically to consider
                employment and homelessness in Dublin and to provide an
                assessment of skills and training needs. Those initiatives could
                be followed here to reduce our level of homelessness.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree that we need to develop a clear and
                coherent strategy, and the report states that clearly. An action
                plan that sets clear targets for reducing homelessness is also
                needed. Joined-up government in all respects is essential. The
                report highlights the need to recognise that the problem does
                not just exist at Christmas but needs attention all year round.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My party and I support fully the Committee’s
                call to the Executive to demonstrate political leadership and
                direction in promoting a joined-up approach. I, therefore,
                commend the report and congratulate the Committee members and
                staff for their excellent and timely inquiry.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir John Gorman:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wonder whether anyone in the Chamber ever
                considers how he would behave if he were homeless. Homelessness
                is almost unimaginable to us, but it is a major factor in people’s
                lives outside the Chamber. We cannot begin to conceive what it
                must be like to have nowhere safe to live. We can only imagine
                the effect that it must have on the employment, health and
                educational prospects of a person or family, not to mention
                self-esteem. However, we can deal with the effects of
                homelessness on the welfare of communities and society here as a
                whole.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Homelessness used to be a Cinderella issue
                here. As many know, I was head of the Housing Executive for
                several years. In those days, it was not seen as something worth
                significant care. Homelessness was a transient condition
                experienced by few. It did not receive much priority, partly
                because it was not so great a problem, dwarfed, as it was, by
                sectarian and terrorist strife and the curse of unemployment.
                One curse is still with us, while the other is not so prevalent.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We can ignore homelessness no longer, and the
                Committee for Social Development, under its Chairperson, my
                Colleague Fred Cobain, has not been ignoring it. The figures are
                so serious that they demand our attention. I am sure that
                Members are bored hearing how serious the matter is, but I want
                to put the figures into a different context. The proportion of
                those who are homeless in Northern Ireland is double the figure
                in England and Wales and higher than that in Scotland, so this
                constituent nation of the United Kingdom has the most serious
                homelessness problem.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The worst thing is that the figures are
                rising. That is due partly to social disturbance caused by the
                problems we have with living together, which I mentioned
                earlier. However, that is only part of the reason. Homelessness
                here is rising by 15% a year. Some of the reasons for that are
                obvious and derive from the basic underlying problems of this
                society for which there are no simple solutions. If there were,
                we would not be engaged in the current political process.
                However, the lack of sufficient affordable social housing is not
                a problem of the same order. It is not beyond the competence of
                the Minister, the Department and the Assembly to at least bring
                Northern Ireland’s proportion of households presenting as
                homeless into line with that in England and Wales.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.45 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When I took over the Housing Executive after
                coming back from India, it had 240,000 social housing units, and
                it is now responsible for 120,000. Fewer than 1,500 — 1,200 is
                the average — new houses are being built by housing
                associations each year, while 5,000 houses are being made
                available under the right to buy. I support that right, and
                every Member in the Chamber probably supports it at heart, but
                those houses are lost to those who require social housing. There
                is an annual deficit of around 4,000 houses available for social
                need — and that is quite a large number in this Province.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr ONeill referred to youth homelessness,
                which has increased by 15% since the Assembly first met. Most of
                those who present as homeless are accepted as being eligible for
                housing, despite many of them being from vulnerable backgrounds
                in some kind of social care. Single young men are especially
                affected and are most likely to be homeless for a considerable
                period because they are not eligible for priority housing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While the Committee, with the exception of Mr
                ONeill, is not recommending that priority status be extended
                automatically to people purely on the grounds of their youth, I
                would like to see special help for those from a care background,
                who are statistically more likely to find themselves on the
                wrong side of the law. Their needs must be assessed in detail
                before they leave care — whether in an institution, jail or
                borstal — and I am concerned that that is not happening
                adequately at present. Growing up in care and moving to
                homelessness is not the kind of start in life that is conducive
                to living a worthwhile, lawful existence.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our report makes sensible, coherent
                recommendations. It sets out a revised definition of
                homelessness to include all those who do not have a safe and
                accessible place to stay. It also recommends a much more
                interdisciplinary approach to those presenting as homeless. The
                Housing Executive must have the lead role, of course, but it is
                important that other inputs be received and taken into account
                in determining an individual’s or family’s needs. Care
                conferences — conferring between the various bodies with
                responsibility — have a valuable part to play.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The needs of homeless youths require a
                specific approach that takes into account their particular needs
                and problems. Those young people who are not eligible for
                priority status must have an adequate referral system that takes
                account of their situation and does not leave them outside the
                door of the Housing Executive office with nowhere to turn. The
                back streets of London, Dublin or Manchester are no place for
                them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Looking after the needs of youths coming out
                of care is what might be called a preventative strategy. We can
                learn from best practice in Scotland. We need to set targets.
                However, there is also an onus on those presenting as homeless.
                Many of them need training in the life skills that we take for
                granted if they are not to become recurrently homeless. Basic
                financial management and the prioritisation of housing costs in
                a household budget may seem of obvious importance. For some,
                however, that approach needs to be taught, as Mr ONeill reminded
                us; it does not come naturally.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The French foyer system, which has been
                adopted here on a small scale, provides simple, affordable
                dwellings, each of which accommodates four or five young
                homeless people. Those young people are trained in homemaking,
                and, if they wish, trained in an employment skill. One such
                scheme operates in Derry and two in Belfast. The Department for
                Social Development will shortly carry out a study of those
                schemes to find out whether the system could be extended.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Above all, we need a sustained building
                programme of affordable social housing. We read eternally of new
                apartment developments in exclusive locations, many of which, I
                might add, are white elephants. There are not enough Executive
                — with a capital &quot;E&quot; — homes. The volume of
                new-build social housing is critically low, given the rapid
                increase in our population compared with other regions of the
                UK. Northern Ireland has the highest population growth in the
                UK. Unless we tackle the situation with political will married
                to adequate resources, our homelessness problem will continue to
                grow. The Committee saw special merit in specialised
                transitional housing units to deal with disadvantaged groups
                such as young people and those emerging from care into the
                community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Homelessness is no longer a Cinderella
                subject. The Committee for Social Development, on which I am
                proud to serve under the chairmanship of my Colleague Fred
                Cobain, has made homelessness a real issue. The situation is
                verging on a crisis. I am sorry that the new housing Bill has
                taken so long to emerge. I look forward to the Assembly’s
                debate on it, with reference to the needs and priorities
                identified by the Committee. Above all, I hope that the Minister
                recognises the need to prevent homelessness. Only through a
                proactive policy will we do any more than alleviate the worst
                effects of homelessness on the homeless themselves and on the
                whole community. I support the motion.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Tierney:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion. We are privileged to
                have had the involvement of two Deputy Chairpersons of the
                Committee for Social Development, each of whom worked on half of
                the report. I welcome the Minister’s presence, and I thank the
                Committee staff for their help.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members mentioned their constituencies, Madam
                Deputy Speaker, so I hope that you will allow me to mention
                mine. There is an increase in the incidence of homelessness in
                my constituency, where new houses are being allocated either
                this week or next week. Homeless people require 180 points to
                qualify for priority housing. Someone who presents himself as
                homeless will be given 70 points; however, other priority needs
                must be demonstrated in order to acquire 180 points.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A young single female parent with two
                children, one of whom has a health problem, is homeless in my
                constituency. She suffers from depression. Most GPs will tell
                you that many people who have been on the homeless list for a
                year, as many in my constituency have been, will suffer from
                depression.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is why I support the Chairperson of the
                Committee for Social Development when he says that the effects
                of homelessness should be the responsibility of the Department
                of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, the Department of
                Education and the Department for Employment and Learning. The
                Health Department has an obvious responsibility because the
                health of a young mother with two children who has to live in,
                and move between, bed and breakfasts and hostels will suffer.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some people say that there is adequate hostel
                provision in the Derry area — and there is good hostel
                provision — but the hostels are full, and those people who
                cannot get into a hostel have to go to bed-and-breakfast
                accommodation which, as my Colleague Mr ONeill said, they have
                to vacate after breakfast. If a young mother with two children
                is faced with that experience, Members will understand how much
                she and her children will have suffered at the end of a year or
                more.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The waiting list for houses is growing
                because of the lack of new build. In the past the Assembly has
                debated Housing Executive cutbacks. At one time the Housing
                Executive’s budget was a high priority, but its importance has
                slipped. That priority should be reintroduced to sort out
                homelessness. I am glad that the Committee for Social
                Development has prioritised the issue. I know that the Minister
                will give homelessness the same priority, because any time that
                he has spoken to the Committee, or to concerned individuals, he
                has been positive about the issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is not only the Minister for Social
                Development who is responsible for the homeless. Other Ministers
                must become involved to ensure that adequate funding is granted
                to housing when the subject is discussed by the Executive.
                Social and affordable housing is required, but it will not be
                the answer to every problem because, as Mr ONeill has said,
                homeless people face many problems. However, if there were
                enough houses, the homeless waiting list would not increase year
                in, year out. If things continue as they are and the same
                funding is provided by the Housing Executive, there is no reason
                to believe that the numbers on the waiting list will decrease. I
                hope that the report’s recommendations will go some way
                towards ensuring that proper funding will be given to housing
                and that a decrease in the waiting list will be visible.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other issues and Departments are given
                priority, so serious consideration must be given to the issue of
                homelessness. The Minister of Health, Social Services and Public
                Safety and the Chairperson of the Health Committee have spoken
                about the prevention of homelessness. If the Assembly is serious
                about prevention, this is where it begins. If a young mother and
                her two children are moved from house to house and from hostel
                to bed and breakfast, what must be the condition of their
                health?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Homeless people often cannot cope in hostels,
                and sometimes they are taken in by friends or family members.
                However, that can lead to overcrowding, which is also difficult
                to cope with. If a homeless person decides to move out from a
                friend’s or family member’s house to try to better
                themselves, or because of circumstances in that house, they are
                classed as intentionally homeless. Therefore, the homeless
                person — and in the case of my example, a mother with two
                children — is classed as intentionally homeless and is placed
                at the bottom of the waiting list. If the person is not classed
                as homeless, he or she may have to wait a couple of years to be
                housed. Where does that leave the young mother and her two
                children?</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.00</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I make that point because it is an example of
                the kind of case that comes to my office and to the Housing
                Executive. The Housing Executive should be the body to recommend
                who should be regarded as homeless; it has been used to working
                with the issue. The record shows an increase of 15% in the level
                of homelessness. However, many people are not put on the
                homeless list, so the situation is worse than has been stated
                today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I congratulate the people who made oral and
                written submissions. It shows the urgency of the problem of
                homelessness and the priority that they give to it. It is
                important that Members do the same. Most Members have sat on
                councils where they have fought and argued for proper funding.
                They are now in a position to get that funding and to get the
                relevant Ministers to join with the Minister for Social
                Development to push for proper funding. I urge the Minister for
                Social Development to consider making his case to the Executive.
                I say that not for political point scoring — the Minister
                makes an excellent case for homeless people and for housing in
                general. However, if he were to make that case to the Executive,
                I am sure that the proper funding would be made available.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the Committee was preparing the report,
                it was clear that one of the problems over the past few years
                has been a decrease in the funding available for housing. If
                that trend continues, we will never come to terms with
                homelessness problems. In some cases, it is not being treated as
                a priority, because we do not see cardboard boxes on the streets
                like those in London and elsewhere. However, as Sir John Gorman
                pointed out, the figures show that Northern Ireland has the
                highest rate of homelessness. We are lucky here that friends and
                relatives step in, but it is getting to the stage where
                cardboard boxes may be seen on our streets. If that happened,
                the matter might be treated with the seriousness it deserves,
                but by then it would be too late because the amount of money
                required will be even greater. If we get the money that is
                needed now, we can prevent the cardboard box scenario and stop
                young people sleeping on the streets. That is what we face
                unless we take this matter seriously and allocate proper funding
                to housing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I congratulate the Committee members who
                participated in the lengthy deliberations. The Committee Clerk
                made sure that we went through the subject bit by bit to get
                this right. I hope that the Minister and the Executive will take
                the recommendations on board so that the proper funding will be
                made available. Also I hope that the Minister will join us in
                supporting the recommendations: no doubt he will. I commend the
                report to the House.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Shannon:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the Committee’s recommendations
                and congratulate it on its work. I want to highlight some of the
                recommendations and points that have come to my attention.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The recommendations are relevant and helpful,
                and the need for them has never been more apparent than it is
                today. I want to highlight some of the facts and figures on
                homelessness in Northern Ireland. Sometimes statistics can prove
                what you want them to, but these statistics paint a dark and
                stark picture of the needs of people in the Province.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The number of people presenting as homeless
                to the Northern Ireland Housing Executive has increased by
                15·5%. That is due to increasing social pressures, street
                violence, deprivation, and — one of the big issues — the
                lack of affordable and accessible accommodation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Single people make up a large proportion of
                those who present themselves as homeless, and they do not always
                receive the number of points that will adequately reflect their
                needs or priority. The current points system should be changed
                — and the quicker, the better. If people are coming to my
                advice centre about the issue, then others must be going to
                advice centres across the Province.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Single homeless people can wait a long time,
                sometimes months, without any hope of accommodation.
                Homelessness, or potential homelessness, should receive
                sufficient points to ensure prompt housing. When people come to
                my advice centre with, for example, 100 to 130 points and we
                cannot house them, I ask myself, &quot;What is wrong when people
                have so many points but cannot get housing?&quot; It is
                particularly worrying.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several people in my constituency have been
                in hostels for 12 months while waiting for housing. It must cost
                the Housing Executive a small fortune to accommodate people on a
                short-term basis. It is unacceptable and unbelievable in this
                age. It is unfair for a young family, whether it is a mother
                with two children, or a mother and father with two children, to
                live in such accommodation. Fair points allocation would move
                them through the system long before 12 months pass, and that
                issue must be addressed. The Minister has indicated that we will
                examine the issue soon.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to give another example — I like to
                use examples because they help to clarify the issues. In many
                cases hostel accommodation is unavailable in the areas where
                people live and where their children go to school. Instead, it
                is available in places that are completely divorced from their
                area. For example, people looking for hostel accommodation in
                Newtownards are being told that there is no accommodation
                available there, or in Bangor, and that they will have to go to
                Downpatrick or Larne. It is incredible that people whose
                children go to schools in the Newtownards area have to find
                hostel accommodation somewhere else.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another issue that came to my attention is
                that people have to go to hostel accommodation in parts of the
                Province where they do not feel safe. Hostel accommodation can
                become &quot;hostile&quot; accommodation, and it is a problem
                for some people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Young people are especially vulnerable. We
                have all read the briefs from some organisations, which show
                that there has been a 50% increase in homelessness in young
                people in the past four years. Unfortunately, the Housing
                Executive does not always consider young people to be vulnerable
                because of their age. However, it should; the social needs of
                young people show that there is real need. The legislation
                should be extended to include the 16- to 18-year-old bracket
                solely on age grounds, and many of us would agree with that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a problem about private
                accommodation, and that problem occurs regularly. I will use
                examples again — so forgive me, Madam Deputy Speaker. Minimal
                private accommodation is available in Ards borough, and what is
                available is at an exorbitant rent. In many cases, the rent for
                private two-bedroom accommodation can be between £400 and £500
                a week. We all know how housing benefit works, but it cannot
                cover that level of rent, especially for people who are on other
                benefits or have special financial circumstances.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Housing Executive can make a
                discretionary payment. However, shortfalls occur, especially in
                rent payments for tenants in private accommodation. The housing
                benefit system and the availability of discretionary payments
                need to be reviewed to help people with specific needs or
                financial problems.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The intentionality clause is sometimes
                difficult to understand. The Housing Executive decided that some
                of my constituents became homeless intentionally. Circumstances
                can, and do, change, not always through the fault of the
                applicant. The system should be more flexible as regards
                intentionality.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recommendation 9, which states that the
                Housing Executive should be the lead organisation, is an
                appropriate and helpful suggestion that would focus attention.
                The Executive was responsible for all housing until a short time
                ago. It makes sense to allow the Housing Executive to take the
                lead role in implementing an agreed strategy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Social housing is a major issue, given the
                number of people who are looking for a house but cannot get one.
                Recommendation 21 refers to social housing provision and calls
                for a review of new-build policy. Such a review would be crucial
                to ensure that appropriate changes take place in my area.
                Recently, I asked the Minister for Social Development how many
                people were on the housing waiting list in the Ards Borough
                Council area. The number has risen dramatically over recent
                years, mainly because insufficient accommodation is available.
                In my discussions with the Housing Executive over the past few
                weeks, officers said that they could not remember there having
                been such a slow turnover of housing as there has been during
                the past month to six weeks. Some applicants with a high number
                of points cannot get a house; that must frustrate them, because
                accommodation is normally given to people in that points
                bracket.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recommendation 21 states that land must be
                made available for new-build social housing so that accessible
                and affordable accommodation can be built in Northern Ireland.
                Housing associations are not slow to pinpoint or try to obtain
                land. Unfortunately, however, they do not have as many financial
                resources as developers or private housing associations, so they
                cannot buy as much land. The legislation must be changed so that
                new-build social housing can be addressed as a separate
                category.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I congratulate the Minister, who has worked
                hard to deal with the housing problem. Mr Tierney said that if
                the Minister were a Housing Executive official, much more money
                would be made available for housing. If Mr Tierney and Housing
                Executive officials already know about the housing need, they
                too should address the matter. The Minister and the Committee
                have worked hard, and the report’s recommendations will
                address the problem.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recommendation 22 refers to the need for
                housing units, especially in rural areas. It is often forgotten
                that not all housing is situated in towns or villages; some of
                it is in the countryside. I have been approached by many
                constituents who want a house in the countryside, often because
                they were brought up there and want to return to their roots. It
                is unfortunate that there is no strategy to provide rural
                housing; therefore I commend recommendation 22, which addresses
                the needs of those who want to live in the countryside.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I commend the report; it contains some good
                points.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Gildernew:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.
                I join other Members in congratulating the Committee staff for
                enabling us to carry out the investigation and the thorough way
                in which they looked for responses to it. The Committee took a
                wide-ranging look at the entire issue of homelessness and how to
                eradicate it. The Committee received several submissions, both
                oral and written. Some responses were very honest, forthright
                and straightforward; the Committee needed to hear those in order
                to make the recommendations in the report.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Colleagues on the Committee for Social
                Development, and others, have outlined many of the problems that
                homelessness creates and many of its causes. There is, as we all
                know, a strong correlation between homelessness and mental
                illness. A vicious cycle is also created between alcohol and
                drug abuse and violence. Support services have been unable to
                cope with people who have been labelled as unco-operative or who
                make certain lifestyle choices, creating a cycle between prison,
                hostels and the streets.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those presumptions must be challenged. They
                are a cop-out; a way of rationalising and making excuses for the
                level of homelessness in the Six Counties. There must be a
                safety net, a link between social services, medical services and
                the Housing Executive. Educational support for adults is needed
                to help people to rebuild shattered lives, regain confidence and
                earn a living. We must also enable people to acquire the skills
                to run and keep a home. More health education is needed, as is
                more awareness in the health agencies of homelessness and its
                detrimental effect on health.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome pilot schemes and initiatives by
                the Department of Education to help with peer education. The
                Department has brought young people into schools to talk to
                their peers about homelessness, how a person might become
                homeless and the difficulties of living on the streets, which
                are often glossed over. Young people can often romanticise the
                notion of being homeless, but bringing other young people in to
                talk to students about the harsh reality of homelessness and how
                it impacts upon them has been a big help. I congratulate the
                Minister of Education for introducing that initiative and
                encourage other Ministers to do likewise.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must also bring services to homeless
                people, as they often cannot avail of services on a 9-to-5
                basis. Services must cater to people’s needs. If services are
                provided but not used, they are often removed. We must ensure
                that the services that are provided are easily accessible and
                that homeless people avail of them. A more progressive
                definition of homelessness must be developed. There is
                legislation on the horizon from the Minister for Social
                Development, Nigel Dodds, but Sinn Féin will try to ensure that
                the best definition is arrived at to make sure that people do
                not fall through the safety net.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There must be an immediate increase in the
                number of available hostel beds. That came through strongly in
                compiling the Committee’s report. We must ensure that people
                are not caught in the traps created by the definition of
                homelessness. Initiatives such as the one in Strabane have
                identified a specific need and catered for it accordingly. More
                funding is needed for that type of hostel accommodation. That
                kind of imaginative approach has been lacking, and we must
                ensure that we think outside the box and come up with new ideas
                to try to completely eradicate homelessness.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issue of catchment areas must also be
                addressed. Homelessness, by its very nature, means that people
                drift from one area to another and can end up falling between
                two stools. Now that we have started to get rid of the
                loopholes, we must create a watertight safety net to ensure that
                people cannot fall out of sight and to ensure that people get
                the services that they need. Let us take as an example the
                reduction in the number of psychiatric beds in the Twenty-six
                Counties in the 1980s from 20,000 to 2,000. That reduction,
                which was mirrored in the Six Counties in the Thatcher era, was
                staggering and created huge problems.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">More psychiatric beds alone are not the
                answer. We must ensure that those leaving hospital are given
                appropriate accommodation and, more importantly, support. That
                does not happen now. People with varied problems are often
                placed in environments which are not good for them, and they
                cannot cope. The effects of the ending of transitional housing
                benefit must also be examined, as must the introduction of the
                Supporting People programme and its impact on the number of
                homeless people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must deal too with young homeless women.
                The increase in the number of women with mental illness has been
                well documented, but the number of women facing domestic
                violence has increased. They have to flee unsafe relationships,
                and it was clear to the Committee that hostel facilities
                specifically for women are inadequate. We need accommodation
                which is secure and safe from violent partners, and other hostel
                residents for women and children. Women’s Aid does sterling
                work, but more funding is needed to ensure that such women have
                a safe haven.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rural homelessness is often hidden. People
                feel isolated because there are no facilities at all and end up
                sleeping on friends’ floors. The extent of rural homelessness
                does not show up in the statistics. The levels of unfitness in
                rural areas must be investigated. I have previously said here
                that Fermanagh’s level is 17·5%, and tackling that would
                lower the number of homeless people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Furthermore, we have young people who leave
                care and find themselves homeless. There are no support services
                to help them get on their feet. More imaginative ways of helping
                such young people to find and keep a home must be considered.
                Eileen Bell referred to the event earlier this year at which we
                spoke to several children in care. They asked about the likes of
                the cost of a television licence, a huge expense to a 17- or
                18-year old who is trying to get by on a small amount of money.
                We often take such things for granted, but children who leave
                care have more problems maintaining a home.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There must be a holistic approach to
                eradicating homelessness. It is not for the Department for
                Social Development and its Committee alone to investigate
                homelessness and its effects. The Department of Health, Social
                Services and Public Safety, the Department of Education and the
                Department of Finance and Personnel must examine the position.
                Funding must be made available, and I echo John Tierney’s call
                for the Minister to ask the Executive for increased funding to
                ensure that the number of homeless people is reduced. It is an
                indictment of the Assembly that the number continues to rise. We
                must ensure that that trend is reversed and that homelessness is
                eradicated.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Davis:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall be brief. Although I am not a Member
                of the Committee for Social Development, I firmly believe that
                it is right for all Members to support this report. I thank the
                Committee for Social Development, led by Fred Cobain, and
                everyone who was involved in the research.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am shocked by the startling homelessness
                statistics, which show that there are homeless people throughout
                Northern Ireland. The death rate for rough sleepers under the
                age of 30 is 40 times the Northern Ireland average, and their
                lives are characterised by ill health and disability.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report highlights an increase in the
                number of homeless people, which is extremely worrying. That
                suggests that the present system does not help the situation and
                is not, therefore, satisfactory. New legislation that will get
                to the core of the problem is needed. In days gone by, we could
                have blamed direct rule, but, with the devolved Administration,
                we no longer have that excuse.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is also worrying to note that Northern
                Ireland has a higher proportion of homelessness than other parts
                of the United Kingdom. From a moral perspective, everyone should
                acknowledge the problems that the report highlights. The
                homelessness issue is not simplistic, and, therefore, any
                proposed measures must be carefully considered. As the Committee
                Chairperson said, it is not only a matter for the Minister for
                Social Development, but one that should involve the Minister of
                Health, Social Services and Public Safety, the Minister of
                Education and the Minister for Employment and Learning. A
                co-ordinated, well-organised and proactive campaign is needed.
                The Council of Europe’s study group on homelessness recognised
                that fact. It stated that</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;If shelter is not accompanied by a
                range of social measures and the rapid return to housing, the
                situation of homelessness is likely to be recurrent&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Homelessness also affects people’s health,
                with 30% to 50% of homeless people having mental health
                problems. Therefore, the Mental Health Commission must become
                involved. However, as Members know, that group is underfunded
                and overstretched. Homeless people often find it difficult to
                register with a GP or a dentist. Undoubtedly, that is linked to
                people’s perceptions of the homeless, thus an educational
                campaign would be helpful. Therefore, I welcome recommendation
                20 of the report.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There must be appropriate legislation to
                minimise the problem of homelessness. Since the Assembly was
                established, there have been calls for legislation. However,
                nothing has come before the House, but, as Members have been
                told, that may change in the next few weeks. The Minister for
                Social Development understands the seriousness of the issue, and
                I welcome any legislation aimed at tackling the root of the
                problem.</p>

                Fred West, the multiple murderer. Many young people, and
                probably many more about whom we did not know, lost their lives.
                It is important to point out that those people were young and
                homeless. West’s crimes are significant because they represent
                the pinnacle of evil. Many thousands of young people may not
                quite meet the same fate as Fred West’s victims, but their
                suffering and poor health, which they continue to endure, are
                important.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I congratulate the Committee for Social
                Development on its excellent report. I also congratulate the
                Chairperson of that Committee, Mr Fred Cobain, on writing to me
                as Chairperson of the Committee for Health, Social Services and
                Public Safety inviting my Committee to participate in the
                inquiry. My Committee’s contribution was relevant.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee for Health, Social Services and
                Public Safety welcomes the report. It is useful and timely, and
                it addresses the real needs of a vulnerable section of our
                community. The sign of a caring society is the extent to which
                it meets the needs of all sections of the community, including
                the homeless. Several of the recommendations are particularly
                relevant to the Health Committee. We are now dealing with the
                Children (Leaving Care) Bill, which addresses the needs of
                vulnerable young people who leave care. The Committee has
                welcomed the action that the Bill proposes to ensure that
                suitable accommodation is provided for those young people.
                Departments and agencies must liaise with each other to ensure
                that accommodation is made available.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report proposes that there should be a
                revised definition of homelessness. I would welcome that.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The absence of a safe and accessible

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">is a good definition that can be recommended.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recommendation 3 mentions a &quot;‘case
                conferencing system’&quot;. Wearing my GP’s hat, and as one
                who participated in many case conferences about child abuse over
                the years at which social workers, community nurses and others
                were present, I welcome that recommendation. Case conferencing
                is the most effective way to deal with that matter. I strongly
                welcome the case conferencing system and encourage its
                establishment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not like the expression
                &quot;intentionally homeless.&quot; Some people are
                intentionally homeless, but that requires definition. Young
                people leave their homes for many reasons; perhaps there are
                problems in the home, or the young person could have their own
                problems.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have nothing but praise for the outstanding
                work that the Housing Executive has done. Its former chief
                executive, Sir John Gorman, is present in the Chamber and spoke
                earlier in the debate. If somebody is homeless the Housing
                Executive does its best, but if a primary-care worker, such as a
                GP, wants to involve a social worker for assessment purposes, I
                often find that social services say that the request must come
                from the Housing Executive. That makes that principle farcical.
                The people with whom you deal in the Housing Executive are not
                social workers; that is an important point.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Doctors working for the Eastern Health Board
                write reports based on a GP’s letter or another document that
                has come before them, even though they may not have seen the
                person involved. That is important if we consider the idea of
                the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, the
                Department for Social Development and other relevant Departments
                working hand-in-hand.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Health wrote to Mr Cobain
                drawing attention to ‘Investing for Health’, which
                acknowledges the negative impact of homelessness on health.
                &quot;Negative impact&quot; is an understatement. The Minister
                goes on to say that it is well known that surveys have shown
                high levels of mental illness among people living in temporary
                shelters or sleeping rough. They have complex needs. ‘Investing
                for Health’ goes on and on about that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the most important parts of the
                Children (Leaving Care) Bill provides for personal advisers for
                young people leaving care. I appreciate that homelessness
                relates to everyone who is homeless, but I will concentrate on
                young people. Personal advisers, who will be appointed by the
                relevant trusts, will play a key role in helping young people
                towards adulthood through education and training, and will help
                to prevent homelessness.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recommendation 6 of the report states:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The Committee also recommends that the
                individual needs of children leaving care must be carefully
                examined before making a final determination on priority
                status.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report also goes on to state the need to
                ensure that</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;the provisions contained in the
                Children Leaving Care Bill and any legislative proposals
                relating to housing and homelessness are compatible and
                beneficial to these vulnerable young people.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I assure the members of the Committee for
                Social Development and the Minister that the clauses in the Bill
                are most relevant to the issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A young person may not have parents, for one
                reason or another, or the parents may not be available.
                Therefore, it will be important that the Housing Executive and
                all relevant authorities work through the personal adviser to
                help the young person towards adulthood.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill also contains provision for a
                pathway plan for the young person who is being released into the
                community. The plan will cover education and training, but it
                will also help to prevent homelessness. The plan will cover the
                young person’s health up to the age of 21. Members can see
                that it will be important that the Department of Health, Social
                Services and Public Safety and the Department for Social
                Development work closely together in this aspect.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is vital that the Department of Health,
                Social Services and Public Safety define what is meant by
                &quot;suitable accommodation&quot; for young people leaving
                care. It is also vital that landlords be suitable and care for
                this vulnerable section of our community. The Committee for
                Health, Social Services and Public Safety will be scrutinising
                the actions of the Department of Health, Social Services and
                Public Safety in the coming months to ensure that guidance to
                boards and trusts addresses those accommodation needs. That will
                be the key to preventing homelessness. Many of the young people
                have low self-esteem.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clause 6 in the Children (Leaving Care) Bill
                deals with the transfer of benefits from the Social Security
                Agency to the Department of Health, Social Services and Public
                Safety. Many of the bodies that the Committee for Health, Social
                Services and Public Safety spoke to, including the National
                Society for the Protection of Cruelty to Children, were anxious
                that the clause should be withdrawn. However, the Committee,
                having discussed the matter with departmental officials,
                understands why it is necessary to transfer benefits — the
                Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety will be
                taking a parental role for those young people. I am not entering
                into that debate at the moment. The Committee is aware of the
                issue but has not made up its mind as to whether to accept
                clause 6, and the Minister is aware of the matter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department for Social Development, the
                Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety and
                other relevant bodies, such as the Health Promotion Agency, need
                to be involved and need to liaise on the matter. Health boards
                and trusts have a major role to play in promoting health.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Earlier, John Tierney spoke about the new
                system for borrowing money that was announced after the visit
                from the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
                Although it will be a loan, a great deal of money will be made
                available that should be used to tackle the problem of
                homelessness.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although I welcome the entire report by the
                Committee for Social Development, I am not happy with
                recommendation 9, which states:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The Committee recommends that an
                integrated inter-Departmental and inter-agency approach to
                homelessness is developed&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I could not disagree with that. However, the
                recommendation continues by stating that the approach should be</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;led and managed by the Northern Ireland
                Housing Executive and that work on this should begin
                immediately.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am a great supporter of the Northern
                Ireland Housing Executive. I also support the idea that an
                interdepartmental group with expertise in that field should be
                set up. In particular, such a group should include the
                Department for Social Development and the Department of Heath,
                Social Services and Public Safety. However, I totally disagree
                with the proposal that that group should be led and managed by
                the Housing Executive. I have nothing but respect for the
                Housing Executive, but so many professionals would need to be
                involved and so much expertise would be required. The Housing
                Executive would need to employ many professionals in the fields
                of health, social development and other areas, so I do not see
                it as the leader of such a group.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a public representative, I have been
                dealing with the Housing Executive for more years than I care to
                count. I am glad that the Minister is present when I say that I
                would prefer the people with expertise to be brought together in
                an interdepartmental group that could work side by side with the
                Housing Executive. Some might argue that it does not matter who
                leads whom, but the Housing Executive, which is not a
                departmental body, should not lead the group. I agree with the
                spirit, but not the substance, of recommendation 9.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Birnie:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I commend the Committee for Social
                Development, of which I am not a member. However, what I have
                seen of the report suggests that it is a solid production, and
                everyone involved should be commended.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is a critical subject, and the report,
                like other sources, such as the Council for the Homeless
                Northern Ireland, communicates well the seriousness of the
                problem. As Members have pointed out, the number of homeless
                people has increased by about one quarter. The incidence of
                homelessness in Northern Ireland, despite traditional
                perceptions, is higher than in any other part of the United
                Kingdom. The true position may be worse than the official
                statistics indicate because the nature of the problem means that
                some cases of homelessness are concealed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with paragraph 1.6, which praises the
                efforts of the full range of concerned bodies and agencies,
                including, on the statutory side, the Housing Executive, the
                health and social services boards, trusts and agencies, and, on
                the voluntary and community side, a variety of charities and
                church organisations. I also agree with paragraph 1.6 that,
                given the seriousness of the problem, there should be a
                redoubling of efforts by the various players in that field.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Homelessness is one of the worst, if not the
                worst, form of social exclusion. In part, that is because it can
                be the root cause of other types of poverty and social
                exclusion, such as illness, unemployment, or the inability to
                progress with education.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I strongly agree with recommendation 18,
                which refers to the need for a preventative strategy. It is
                better for all concerned, and more cost effective in the long
                run, if we prevent persons from becoming homeless in the first
                place. Throughout the recommendations there is a correct
                emphasis on this strategy’s being interdepartmental. Indeed,
                in the speeches so far we have heard evidence of that. This is
                not just a matter for the Committee for Social Development, as
                we heard from the Chairperson of the Committee for Health,
                Social Services and Public Safety.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also agree with recommendation 19, which is
                about building up the life skills of individuals who, sadly, are
                homeless. This will enable homeless people to make the
                transition to a settled form of independent life, which can be
                difficult, and provide a general improvement in their level of
                training, education, and qualifications. That touches on another
                interdepartmental aspect, as it brings the Department of
                Education and the Department for Employment and Learning into
                play.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Regarding the training and educational aspect
                of dealing with homelessness, I agree with my Colleague Sir John
                Gorman and commend the work of the Simon Community on the foyer
                initiative. There is one foyer in south Belfast and three in
                other locations across the Province. The south Belfast foyer is
                home to 42 persons in the 17- to 25-year-old age group. The
                interesting feature of the foyer arrangement is the combination
                of sheltered housing with a hands-on, on-site, personalised
                approach to training, which appears to ease the transition of
                people into the labour market. They can eventually stand on
                their own feet, hold down a job and, in turn, pay for
                accommodation and keep themselves, which is the ideal that we
                should be striving for. The foyer initiative is very successful
                in putting and keeping people in permanent, stable employment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another possibility, which is not included in
                the report’s recommendations, is quite radical and also
                interdepartmental. It relates to the provision of an adequate
                degree of additional social housing. Sir John touched on this
                and on the reduction in the number of buildings available. To
                turn that around, we should consider introducing some sort of
                preference into the planning process in favour of property
                developers who agree to set aside some of the land, and, by
                implication, some of the housing, in new developments for
                housing-association type dwellings.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I strongly support the motion and commend
                this report.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr S Wilson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At this stage of the debate most of the
                recommendations in the report have probably been touched on by
                most Members, and, therefore, I want to concentrate on only a
                couple of points.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, the Committee for Social Development
                approached this subject in a balanced way. There are people who
                would love to make an industry out of the unfortunate
                circumstances that homeless people find themselves in. When
                looking at homelessness, we must ensure that we look at it in a
                way that is sympathetic to those who, through no fault of their
                own, find themselves in the worst of all situations of not
                having a home, with all that is attached to that. Other Members
                have already spoken about the fact that losing or not having a
                home is not the sum total of disadvantage — it is the start of
                disadvantage because so many other things flow from it.
                Therefore, the Assembly must address genuine homelessness in
                Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Much has been said about the number of
                homeless people. However, we must reinforce the distinction
                between those who are homeless and those who present themselves
                as such. The number of people who present themselves as homeless
                has increased a good deal; so has the number of those who are
                judged to be genuinely homeless. The situation is not unique to
                Northern Ireland; it applies across the United Kingdom.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A primary cause of homelessness must be
                considered: almost 2,000 people who present themselves as
                homeless do so because of acts of intimidation. The graph
                contained in the report shows that since the so-called end of
                the terrorist war, the number of people who have presented
                themselves as homeless has surged by almost 15%. Much of that
                increase is due to intimidation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members of Sinn Féin have spoken today about
                the plight of the homeless. This morning I spoke to a group of
                people who represent one street in Belfast. Half of the
                residents of that street now live with relatives, in hotels or
                in boarded-up houses. They want out because of intimidation
                organised by Sinn Féin. It is one thing for Members to complain
                about homelessness; it is another when their associates are
                actively involved each night in putting people — including
                families with young children and people in their 80s — out on
                the streets.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Two Sunday nights ago, I sat in the Salvation
                Army hall at the end of the Newtownards Road; it was full of
                people who had been put out of their houses. Six of those people
                were in their 80s. At 3.00 am they were waiting to find
                somewhere to put their heads for the night, because for the
                third night running their homes had come under a constant
                barrage. They finally had to leave, for their own safety, when
                petrol bombs and blast bombs were thrown at their homes and
                shooting started.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have a duty to deal with the problems of
                the homeless. However, we must also ensure that we do not ally
                ourselves with those who are responsible, and that we are not
                ourselves responsible for such unfortunate circumstances. Mobs
                are orchestrated by Members who sit here today, including the
                Deputy Chairperson, who in her winding-up speech will probably
                condemn homelessness.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was keen that recommendation 4 be included
                in the report. There was much pressure on us to include 16- to
                18-year-olds in the homelessness legislation. I understand that
                many young people become homeless due to unfortunate
                circumstances. Nevertheless, the Assembly has a duty to ensure
                that it does not introduce social legislation that encourages or
                makes it easier for families to break up. We heard evidence that
                many youngsters fall out with their parents. I am sure that all
                Members have experienced such cases in their constituency advice
                centres. Youngsters often go through a rough patch with their
                parents, because of their age, et cetera.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must not present an easy way of resolving
                family conflicts by taking on a statutory responsibility to
                rehouse those youngsters — many of them do not have the skills
                to live by themselves. Equally, we have an obligation to protect
                youngsters who are genuinely being put in danger because of
                circumstances at home. The recommendations get the balance
                right. Recommendation 4 states that</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;whilst the rights of individuals must
                be respected, this must not be at the expense of contributing to
                the breakdown of the family as a stable and caring unit.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am pleased that that recommendation is in
                the report. The balance to that recommendation comes when young
                people present themselves as homeless and there are allegations
                that they want to leave home because of abuse. Recommendation 5
                states that there should be a customised approach for dealing
                with youngsters, including case conferences in which all of the
                interests can be discussed so that there is a full picture of
                the problems facing those young people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report is very useful, and it reflects
                much of what the Housing Executive has already accepted as the
                way forward for dealing with homelessness. I commend it to the
                Assembly.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I call Mrs Annie Courtney. You have about
                three minutes, Mrs Courtney.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Courtney:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will be brief and cut out half of what I
                was going to say.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the report. As the Chairperson of
                the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety has
                said, the report is timely because of our Committee’s
                involvement with the Children (Leaving Care) Bill. Such young
                people are not only young vulnerable adults; they are leaving
                care without any training in household or financial management.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recommendations 5 to 8 are particularly
                important. Recommendation 5 states:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The Committee further recommends that
                the Northern Ireland Housing Executive should establish a
                specific, customised approach in assessing priority needs and
                dealing with young people presenting as homeless.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is particularly relevant to members of
                the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety who
                are considering the Children (Leaving Care) Bill.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recommendations 11, 13, 16, 17 and 18 are
                also important. Recommendation 11 states that</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;the new strategy and action plan should
                include proposals for a common ‘Code of Practice’ for the
                Northern Ireland Housing Executive and those partner
                organisations dealing with the homeless.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recommendation 13 states that the Northern
                Ireland Housing Executive should pursue high standards of
                training for those dealing with the homeless. Recommendations
                16, 17 and 18 deal with the out-of-hours service and a speedy
                independent appeals system, and state that the overall goal
                should be to reduce the number of homeless people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members have highlighted recommendation 19 as
                being particularly significant to young people leaving care who
                will struggle to cope if they do not have the correct support in
                home economics and financial management.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Committee for Health,
                Social Services and Public Safety said that clause 6 of the
                Children (Leaving Care) Bill was causing the Committee concern
                because it dealt with the exclusion of young people from
                benefits. We will be having further discussion on that as we
                have not come to a decision.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members have already referred to the problems
                of people living in rural areas. I welcome recommendation 22,
                which highlights the need for transitional housing units to
                enable the Department for Social Development to respond
                positively. I agree with recommendation 23, which states that
                resources should be transferred to the Department for Social
                Development.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister for Social Development (Mr Dodds):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Committee’s continuing
                interest in housing matters. I commend the work that it and many
                others in the voluntary sector and the Housing Executive are
                engaged in to ensure that policies meet housing need and provide
                good housing services.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.30 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is the thrust of the legislative
                proposals that form the backdrop to the Committee’s report and
                tie in with what my Department has demonstrated is an urgent
                matter that requires urgent action.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many individuals and organisations have a
                range of views on how best to deal with homelessness. That is
                healthy, and I welcome it; I am pleased that they took time and
                showed their interest by contributing to the consultation
                exercise. I welcome the fact that, generally, the review’s
                principle recommendations are in line with our current policy
                and legislative proposals. Members will appreciate that in the
                short time available since the report was submitted to the
                Department, we have not been able to consider it fully and
                discuss the detail of the recommendations. That also applies to
                the comments of Members today, to which I have listened with
                interest. I shall give proper consideration to the report and
                the comments of Members in the debate, and I shall make my views
                known in due course.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the meantime, I shall say a few words
                about the report’s main recommendations. Although most of us
                enjoy a stable and comfortable living environment, that is not
                the experience of those who are homeless. Several Members have
                pointed out just how horrendous it is for individuals and
                families in that situation. The number of households presenting
                as homeless to the Housing Executive and voluntary sector
                organisations that deal with the problem is growing. Factors
                such as relationship breakdown continue to play a major part.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sammy Wilson said that not everyone who
                presents as homeless is accepted under the legislation as such
                — as someone to whom full duty of priority rehousing is owed
                by the Housing Executive. Mr Wilson also made the point that
                2,000 of the cases currently presented as homeless are due to
                intimidation, and, increasingly, the threat of intimidation is
                causing people to leave their homes. That is not something that
                housing providers can address effectively. The deplorable
                incidents of recent weeks, which continue albeit on a smaller
                scale, have put a tremendous burden on all the organisations
                that work to help the homeless, and they do nothing to build
                communities or help those who are homeless for other reasons. In
                fact, they do the opposite. They reduce the number of houses
                available for the others and increase the waiting time to be
                rehoused.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am encouraged, however, by the willingness
                of those involved in the care of homeless people to meet the
                challenges that face them, as exemplified by their response to
                this review and to the recent comprehensive review of services
                to homeless people by the Housing Executive. Improvements will
                be made as implementation of the reviews’ recommendations
                begins.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also hope that the extent of the problem
                and the profile that it is rightly attracting will translate
                into the additional resources that the reviews suggest will be
                required to deal effectively with it. I welcome the comments
                from various parts of the House that show that Members are
                willing to support an allocation of extra resources to deal with
                housing in general and the problems associated with homelessness
                in particular. I hope that that will translate into action, as
                opposed to mere rhetoric, when it comes to votes on the Floor of
                the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not have time to deal in detail with all
                23 recommendations, as they cover a wide range of issues from
                funding to definitions and the need for multiagency and
                cross-departmental actions. To agree the definition of what
                constitutes homelessness is crucial to the success of any
                strategy to tackle the problem. I welcome the Committee’s
                recommendations in that regard, and I hope that the Department
                will be able to achieve the necessary level of agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The existing homelessness legislation, The
                Housing (Northern Ireland) Order 1988, defines a homeless person
                as a person with &quot;no accommodation&quot;. That legislation
                also provides that applicants are homeless if they have
                accommodation but it is not reasonable for them to continue to
                occupy it; if they cannot secure entry to it; or if occupation
                of that accommodation would lead to violence or threats of
                violence. The existing statutory definition of homelessness may
                already meet the Committee’s requirements. When presenting
                evidence to the Committee for Social Development, Mr McIntyre,
                chief executive of the Housing Executive said:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Legislative provision in Northern
                Ireland is generous compared to that of Great Britain. Great
                Britain’s legislation is intended to catch up with that of
                Northern Ireland and to reinstate its own — as it stood before
                the changes made to it by the Conservative Government.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That evidence should be borne in mind when
                considering legislative changes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am glad that the Committee recognises that
                the solution to homelessness does not solely lie in the
                provision of new houses, a point that several Members made.
                Although that is an important part of the solution, the
                Department must tackle the source causes of homelessness and, in
                the process, endeavour where possible to keep families together.
                Several Members, including Mr Sammy Wilson, mentioned that
                recommendation, which is contained in volume 1 of the report as
                recommendation 4. Some Members suggested that there should be
                automatic acceptance of homeless young people as having priority
                need. I agree with what the Committee says on that point in
                recommendation 4.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The breakdown of relationships continues to
                be one of the main causes of homelessness, and it is hoped that
                the recommendations put forward by the Committee for increased
                education, awareness and provision of life skills training, as
                well as better sharing of information, will help to reduce the
                problem.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The recommendations are not solely for the
                Department for Social Development to consider. They will draw
                into the debate others who are at the forefront of such issues,
                not only in Government but in the voluntary sector. Many of the
                recommendations call for the Housing Executive to undertake a
                range of actions. Many of those actions are being undertaken and
                others have been put forward as part of the Housing Executive’s
                review of services. Members will be aware that in September
                2001, the Housing Executive went out to consultation on
                developing a new approach to delivering homelessness services.
                That consultation period ended in December 2001. The main
                findings and recommendations of the Housing Executive’s review
                have been published and are widely known.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The recommendations provide a foundation on
                which to build and improve what is happening and is being
                proposed. The Housing Executive will want to take on board the
                Committee’s suggestions before it completes its implementation
                plan. That plan will be drawn up after the completion of its own
                review of services. The Housing Executive delayed the
                publication of that final implementation plan to allow time to
                take on board and consider what the Committee for Social
                Development had to say.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Housing Executive has set targets to deal
                with homelessness. That is worthwhile, even if at times the
                targets are not met to the intended extent. Setting targets
                helps us to move forward, and by analysing why they are not met
                we can see where the problems lie. However, the targets must be
                achievable, and they should not be set simply because they look
                good — nor should we shy away from them because they may be
                hard to achieve. In considering the targets to be set, we must
                ensure that they are meaningful and that we have control over
                their achievement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As part of the promoting social inclusion
                element of new targeting social need, my Department is taking
                the lead in a review of the difficulties faced by homeless
                people in getting access to services. The review will be
                cross-departmental and cross-sectoral. It will build on the
                review carried out by the Housing Executive and the review
                carried out by the Committee for Social Development. I will
                refer the report to a working group which will draw its members
                from a wide spectrum of interested parties and help to devise
                strategies for dealing with homelessness.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Experience and best practice elsewhere will
                be an aspect of the promoting social inclusion priority project
                on homelessness. As recognised by the last recommendation, the
                strategies that we devise must be properly funded. I will
                continue to try to attract the maximum resources that competing
                bids will allow.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Following the announcement of the
                reinvestment and reform initiative by the Chancellor during his
                recent visit to Belfast, I took the opportunity to bid for £10
                million for 2003-04 for 150 additional units to accommodate
                homeless people. That bid, if successful, will materially assist
                in meeting a Programme for Government target that commits the
                Department for Social Development to ensure that everyone can
                get access to decent, affordable housing in the tenure of his
                choice. We will work with housing associations and enable them
                to assist the Housing Executive to meet its statutory obligation
                to deal with homelessness.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The bids are still being considered by the
                Department of Finance and Personnel, but when the Minister of
                Finance and Personnel reads the contributions from all sides
                about the great social problems that flow from this matter, and
                the priority which is attached to it across the Floor of the
                House and throughout Northern Ireland, I hope that the
                Department for Social Development will receive the additional
                funding necessary. Housing has an important part to play from
                New TSN and social inclusion perspectives in creating a stable
                home environment, better health and better employment
                opportunities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some Members, including Sir John Gorman,
                referred to providing more permanent homes as part of the
                solution. Some of the evidence that was given to the Committee
                said that providing someone with a permanent home is not the
                whole answer, and the Housing Executive also said that. Examples
                were given of people who left temporary accommodation for
                permanent accommodation only to re-present themselves as
                homeless later on. There are ways in which those issues must be
                tackled, not least through correct implementation of the
                Supporting People programme. It will affect single parents,
                young people, care leavers, people with mental illnesses or
                physical disabilities and victims of domestic violence. That
                should not be overlooked.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I have said — and it is recognised by
                the Committee — providing a home is not always enough. An
                appropriate level of support must be given. The Supporting
                People arrangements will help to sustain and improve the
                existing support services for homeless people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A major advantage of the proposed new
                arrangements is that they will combine the many disparate
                sources of funding into a single budget, and that will help to
                create a situation where the needs of the individual will be the
                most important factor.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Committee for taking the time to
                conduct the inquiry and for providing the recommendations. I
                also thank the organisations that provided evidence to the
                Committee to help it formulate its recommendations, and the
                Members who contributed to the debate. It has been pointed out,
                quite correctly, that this is not a matter for the Department
                for Social Development only; other Departments have a crucial
                role to play in preventing homelessness.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several Members raised the issue of
                legislation, which, I hope, will soon be forthcoming. Several
                Members mentioned the housing Bill during the debate, and we
                will have an opportunity to discuss that soon during its Second
                Reading. The new Bill will impact on homelessness by redefining
                &quot;homelessness&quot; and &quot;intentional
                homelessness&quot; and will redefine the treatment of persons
                from abroad and those found guilty of antisocial behaviour. The
                proposals will not detract from the priority for rehousing that
                is currently given to homeless applicants who meet the statutory
                criteria for assistance under homelessness legislation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some Members had hoped that the new Bill
                would come before the House earlier and have mentioned delays
                — I share those concerns. As Minister for Social Development,
                I wish that the Bill had been before the House much earlier. It
                is not the fault of the Department for Social Development, my
                officials or myself that that has not been the case. Some
                Members, who are represented in the Office of the First Minister
                and the Deputy First Minister, might ask that particular
                Department some questions on how the process was conducted to
                get the draft Bill to this stage.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am particularly concerned about housing and
                homelessness. That is why, as I have said, the Housing Executive’s
                review and these recommendations will play an important role in
                the proposals and in the forthcoming implementation plan. I look
                forward to Members’ continuing support as we seek the
                necessary resources to reduce the level of homelessness in
                Northern Ireland.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr G Kelly:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.
                I have been a Member of the Committee for Social Development
                since its establishment in November 1999. I succeeded Michelle
                Gildernew as Deputy Chairperson just after the Committee had
                finished taking oral evidence from individuals and organisations
                in the second phase of the housing inquiry. I want to take the
                opportunity to say that the Chairperson, Fred Cobain, and the
                Deputy Chairperson at that time, Michelle Gildernew, have done a
                job that is second to none.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On 19 March, the Committee was instrumental
                in instigating a debate in the Assembly on the implications of
                introducing a new system for funding housing support costs. That
                debate is clearly connected to the present one.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I understand from the Minister that we will
                have an opportunity in the next few weeks to begin our
                examination of the long awaited housing Bill.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is right that housing should feature on
                the political agenda and in the social conscience of the
                Assembly, but is that enough? Fred Cobain and others pointed out
                that the Executive should pay more attention to what the
                Committee says about the need to keep investment in housing at
                the correct levels. I was heartened and impressed by the candid
                and honest views expressed by many of the witnesses who gave
                evidence to the Committee. All of those bodies were closely
                involved in one way or another with the homeless.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have listened with a great deal of interest
                to the contributions to the debate. I do not recall, either in
                the Committee or on the Floor of the House, anyone suggesting
                that it is not right to highlight the plight of the homeless and
                the extent of homelessness. No one disagrees that more should be
                done to prevent homelessness, and many Members recognise that it
                is not just a matter of bricks and mortar. However, the Assembly
                must back those fine words with actions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The figures speak for themselves.
                Homelessness is on the increase. The conclusion to be drawn from
                that is that policies are flawed, and there is a need for proper
                resourcing. It is said that homelessness is not a major problem
                in Northern Ireland because people are not seen sleeping in
                doorways. In fact, the Lee Hestia Association’s study reported
                that at least 80 people in Belfast sleep outdoors every night.
                While Belfast is not a cardboard city, the Assembly should be
                under no illusions. Unless we tackle the problem directly and
                urgently, it is inevitable that our failure to do so will
                manifest itself more sharply, and it will not be long before the
                number of people occupying those doorways increases.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the course of the inquiry there was a
                tragic fire at the Morning Star Hostel on the night of 11
                February 2002. The Committee expressed its condolences and sent
                messages of support to those who were most closely involved with
                the hostel, and who are now constantly reminded of the fire. The
                services provided by the hostel are crucial to those who rely on
                it. We must not fail them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Both Mr ONeill and Sir John Gorman referred
                to the intentionality test, with specific reference to young
                people. They approached the issue from different angles. Perhaps
                both are right. While Sir John said that the Committee did not
                accept the granting of automatic priority to young people who
                present themselves as homeless, I do not think that that is what
                Mr ONeill was saying. After a long debate in the Committee, he
                went off and checked the legislative position, as he said he
                would. He outlined the six categories. I agree with him that
                many young people will fall through the net. The Assembly must
                consider extending the categories of priority need. Studying the
                Homelessness Act 2002 will help us.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The draft housing Bill states that</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;a person shall be treated as becoming
                homeless intentionally if he enters into an arrangement under
                which he is required to cease to occupy accommodation which it
                would be reasonable for him to continue to occupy.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The term &quot;reasonable&quot; needs to be
                clarified.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Sammy Wilson referred to recommendation 4:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The Committee recommends that, whilst
                the rights of individuals must be protected, this must not be at
                the expense of contributing to the breakdown of the family as a
                stable and caring unit.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I return to that because there was quite a
                long debate on it. Perhaps it is not worded in the way that it
                should be. The paramount priority is the right of the
                individual. The Committee is sensitive to the family unit. Dr
                Hendron supported recommendation 3, which refers to case
                conferencing. However, it is important to protect the
                individual, particularly in situations in which there is abuse.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also want to make two political points. The
                case for funds and resources has a much better chance of being
                successful if the Minister who puts in the bids argues the case
                forcefully in the Executive, which makes the collective
                decisions. That is not in question. It is obvious.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sammy Wilson came into the Chamber to make a
                bit of a rant. He referred to homelessness in east Belfast.
                Homelessness is not sectarian. If he and the Minister would show
                leadership and talk to those who are involved, perhaps progress
                would be made. <i>[Interruption].</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am encouraged that at least as many Members
                who are not members of the Committee for Social Development
                contributed to the debate, as those who are. However, it also
                demonstrates the extent of the problem. Obvious themes emerged
                today. One was the shared concern about the increase in the
                number of young homeless people. There were clear calls for a
                proper and inclusive definition of homelessness, raised by the
                SDLP and by Mr ONeill in particular, and picked up by Eileen
                Bell of the Alliance Party, and others.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr ONeill reserved his position on the issue
                raised by the Children’s Law Centre of 16- and 17-year-olds
                being given priority status, which I dealt with earlier. I hope
                that the forthcoming housing Bill will allow us to develop the
                debate on that matter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several Members reflected on the six main
                causes of homelessness, identified in paragraph 2.4 of the
                report. There is support across the House for a joined-up,
                interdepartmental, inter-agency approach, with the Housing
                Executive taking the lead. The need for a sustained commitment
                from other Ministers and their Departments is clearly stated in
                the Committee’s report.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many Members were critical of the
                inappropriate use of bed-and-breakfast facilities, which do not
                represent good value for money. There is also a lack of locally
                accessible temporary accommodation and a need for customised,
                small, intimate foyer-type units, which many Members from
                various parties highlighted. Cross-party support exists for
                greater investment in support services. Many Members have
                advocated life skills programmes, counselling and advice, with
                which suggestion the Committee cannot agree more.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There have been calls for a review of the
                policy of providing social housing, even from the Minister for
                Social Development’s own party. The Committee is sympathetic
                to Mr Birnie’s idea that people who are involved in developing
                social housing sites should be assisted in giving some sort of
                guarantee that a certain section of any development would be for
                social housing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The message about socially affordable housing
                and the annual deficit brought about by a minimalist new-build
                programme, allied to what I accept is a person’s right to buy,
                shows the need for capital investment. Some of Sir John Gorman’s
                statistics were a stark reminder of the size of the problem that
                we face.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Around 50% of social housing stock has been
                sold off, but, despite a young and growing population, it is not
                being replaced. Mark Robinson said that</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Demand for social housing must never be
                found wanting.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Homelessness is not a one-day wonder. Members
                across the Chamber recognise that homelessness requires
                continuous attention. I am sure that the Housing Executive
                accepts the need to adjust its working practices so that people
                leaving institutions — prisons, hospitals or care — can be
                assessed before they become homeless.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am glad that there is broad support for the
                Committee’s calls for the introduction of measures to prevent
                homelessness. John Tierney mentioned the cycle of homelessness
                and the deficiencies of the points system, as did Jim Shannon. I
                hope that the Minister acts on those comments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome Joe Hendron’s remarks about
                pathway plans and personal advisers. I will welcome comments
                about clause 6 of the Children (Leaving Care) Bill from the
                Health Committee, once it has finalised its views. Esmond Birnie
                again hit the nail on the head when he mentioned homelessness as
                an example of social exclusion. I have already dealt with the
                principle of mixed housing developments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I congratulate the Minister on making the
                £10 million bid for 150 units to accommodate homeless people.</p>

                those in the North-Eastern Education and Library Board area,
                which result from inadequate funding arrangements. More than 100
                teachers are being made redundant in the North-Eastern Education

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I draw Members’ attention to the huge
                variation in funding per pupil between schools in different
                education and library board areas. Children in the North-Eastern
                Education and Library Board area receive the second-lowest
                funding per pupil in the controlled sector, as recorded in the
                answer to my question for written answer, AQW 2390/01. What most
                concerns me about that answer is the degree of variation between
                various sectors and boards. According to figures for 2000-01,
                there is a variation of approximately 15% in the funding for
                primary school pupils in different sectors. How can that be
                justified? In the secondary school sector the difference is 18%.
                Such inequality cannot be justified.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am aware of the development of a new common
                funding formula; however, the manner of directing the policy of
                targeting social need itself creates huge variations and
                inequalities between schools. That is because only one criterion
                is being used in determining allocations of TSN funding — the
                entitlement to free school meals.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the consultation document ‘A Common
                Funding Formula for Grant-Aided Schools’, the Department of
                Education points out that a post-primary school of approximately
                700 pupils with a 60% entitlement to free school meals could
                receive up to £166,000 a year more in funding for social
                deprivation than a similar school with a low entitlement to free
                school meals of, say, 10%. Clearly, that could have a huge
                impact on a school’s ability to address educational needs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the concept of targeting social
                need. However, I question the appropriateness of using the free
                school meals criterion as the only measure when targeting TSN
                funds. I also question the degree of variation and inequality
                created by the current policy. I understand that approximately
                5% of the education budget is top-sliced and distributed on the
                basis of entitlement to free school meals. That in turn is based
                on a family’s entitlement to either jobseeker’s allowance or
                income support. Is that an appropriate indicator of deprivation
                in education? Research by the Department of Education and Skills
                has shown that in England and Wales some 20% of parents do not
                take up their entitlement. I suspect that the figure may be even
                higher in Northern Ireland. This criterion is not picking up all
                the children in need.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Locally, according to the figures for
                1997-98, some 26·1% of pupils were entitled to free school
                meals. However, that figure dropped to 21·9% in 2001-02.
                Therefore, although the educational budget has increased, the
                TSN budget is targeted at fewer children, and I suspect that as
                many as 20% of those who are entitled to support do not claim
                it. That reluctance to claim creates inequalities and fails to
                address educational need in many instances.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While researching for the debate, I read
                evidence heard by the Committee for Education. The principal of
                Ballynahinch High School said that</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;there is a resistance among some rural
                families, even when eligible to do so. Thus, any use of FSM
                eligibility as an indicator of need will not benefit the
                school.&quot;</p>

                not address the range of problems of deprivation, and means that
                some schools with low FSM levels do not get the necessary
                help&quot;.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;children in the school are experiencing
                failure, and the school has neither the time nor resources to
                address these issues. There are no funds for a specialist
                teacher. One explanation for this is that, because the school
                has no entitlement to Free School Meals-based funding, high
                levels of educational need are not recognised.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Educational TSN funds could be distributed
                through, for example, the working families’ tax credit. That
                would widen the distribution of funds and, according to recent
                figures from the Department for Social Development, lessen
                inequalities by making an additional 45,000 families eligible.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the Department of Education consider
                using different indicators of deprivation, such as those that
                are used by other Departments? The Noble index was introduced as
                a result of rigorous research and academic work to replace the
                Robson index. It has produced detailed work to show deprivation
                in housing, income, employment, health and disability, and
                educational skills and training. Educational indices are used to
                measure educational deprivation. However, could other more
                objective indicators, such as assessment of Key Stage 1 and 2 in
                primary schools, or absentee levels, be used in the education
                sector? I would like to hear the views of the Minister of
                Education and other Members.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In developing additional criteria, we must
                ensure that schools are neither rewarded for bad results nor
                penalised for good results. Perverse incentives, such as the
                removal of resources when improvements are made, would
                demoralise staff. I support the view of some members of the
                Education Committee that Key Stage 2 is not a suitable indicator
                for the allocation of special education funding to primary
                schools. Given that Key Stage 2 is assessed at the end of
                primary school, it is an inappropriate means by which to measure
                need. Therefore, if a judgement were made on the strength of Key
                Stage 2 performance, bad results may be rewarded, while good
                results may be penalised.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I await with interest the results of the
                needs and effectiveness analysis of the education sector. There
                is concern about the outcome of current TSN policy, and it is to
                be hoped that there will be detailed analysis of how the money
                is spent and the outcomes that are achieved. Could the money be
                better spent in other ways?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During my time as an MLA, I have become aware
                of the relatively poor take-up of state benefits and grants in
                my constituency of East Antrim. Many pensioners do not claim the
                minimum income guarantee to which they are entitled, and recent
                figures show that take-up for the warm homes scheme is lower
                than was expected.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is the case, despite there being
                socially deprived wards and pockets in my constituency, which
                was indicated in the Noble indices. Historically, for whatever

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For whatever reason, many people in my area

                independent to claim state benefits. Children have been doubly
                deprived because their parents have not claimed benefits, and
                that means that those children have not gained the educational
                advantages that result from TSN. I ask the Minister to notice
                that I have not been prescriptive as to what are more
                appropriate criteria for determining future TSN funding. I shall
                listen to other Members’ comments before I take a view on the
                amendment.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;to have his Department, in consultation
                with the Committee for Education, carry out an in-depth review
                of the way social deprivation is measured.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion deals with free school meals.
                Those meals have been used for some time as an indicator of
                social deprivation and, as such, the matter has gained
                international recognition.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion calls for the present system to be
                scrapped and for it to be replaced with an unspecified system
                that will direct funding to the most socially disadvantaged
                children in our community. Any inequalities that exist in the
                present system are unacceptable. However, the introduction of
                untried indicators will not improve the circumstances of those
                who experience social deprivation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Targeting social need is crucial in
                education. The link between underachievement and social
                deprivation is well known and well researched. Schools in
                socially deprived areas need extra funding to improve literacy
                and numeracy, and to help children overcome disadvantages that
                arise from poverty.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As we know, the Department of Education and
                the boards allocate their funding for social deprivation to
                schools on the basis of the numbers who receive free school
                meals. The criterion used to determine who is eligible for free
                school meals is whether a child’s parents are on jobseeker’s
                allowance or income support. Those entitlements have long been
                recognised as good indicators of social deprivation. Although
                questions have been asked, no one as yet has been able to devise
                a better system.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee for Education held an inquiry
                into the Department of Education’s proposals for a new common
                funding formula for all schools. Some submissions raised the TSN
                element of the Department’s proposed new formula. Teachers in
                some schools pointed out that not all the children who were
                eligible for free school meals availed themselves of that
                entitlement. Staff from those particular schools said that
                although they provided additional support for socially
                disadvantaged children, the schools did not benefit from any
                extra money. Consequently, they faced increased financial
                pressures.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At least one other submission questioned
                whether the free school meals entitlement took account of all
                the children from low-income backgrounds. Those comments suggest
                that the free school meals indicator could work better than it
                does.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Therefore, the logical step is to examine how
                the free school meals indicator can be improved. As I have said,
                targeting social need is a crucial element in the funding of our
                schools, and, indeed, many educationalists believe that the
                overall level of money for TSN purposes that the Department
                provides is less than what is required.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Where resources are scarce, the impact of any
                changes to the method of funding under TSN guidelines must be
                given careful consideration. We must work towards a situation in
                which all children from socially deprived backgrounds benefit
                under TSN arrangements, and in which schools with the highest
                levels of social deprivation derive the most benefit.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Much research, discussion and debate are
                required in order to deliver TSN money to the most deserving
                children. Under the terms of the motion, that will not happen.
                The SDLP believes that the issue is central and that the
                Department of Education and the Education Committee should
                revisit it for more detailed discussion.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issue of TSN criteria is important, and
                it affects school budgets in each Member’s constituency. Some
                schools will be grossly advantaged by the application of the
                free school meals formula, and others will be grossly
                disadvantaged to the tune of tens of thousands of pounds and, in
                some cases, to the extent of one or two teachers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The case against the use of free school meals
                as a means of targeting social and educational disadvantage is
                compelling. The use of free school meals as a criterion does not
                deal with the problem. The Department of Education came to that
                conclusion in a report where it is stated that</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;the evidence does not distinguish
                between pupils’ under-attainment resulting from social
                disadvantage and under-attainment with its origins in a lesser
                capacity to learn, irrespective of social and economic
                background. It is therefore somewhat unclear as to which of
                these sources of under-attainment is the most important one and
                where the balance of TSN funding, between social deprivation and
                educational needs, should lie.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Despite that, the Department states that it
                wants to use free school meals as the measure and recognises
                that, even if free school meals were the proper way to fund
                those who are socially disadvantaged and, therefore, have an
                educational disadvantage, or people who are educationally
                disadvantaged, 20% of families do not take up the provision.
                Those figures come from the Department. It does not deal with
                the issue, which is to allocate extra money to help youngsters
                who, because of social disadvantage or an inability to learn,
                have educational needs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the criteria are applied, a totally
                unfair situation emerges if a pupil happens to attend a Belfast
                school and comes from a background where free school meals are
                an entitlement. Depending on the school, no money might be paid
                or an additional £525 might be paid. If other boards are taken
                into consideration, the amount allocated varies from £322 in
                the North-Eastern Education and Library Board area to £298 in
                some grant-maintained schools. The money is not evenly
                distributed, with a variation of almost 100% between pupils.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee received evidence from school
                principals, who made it clear that this was a very unfair
                measure. The almost universal experience of principals from
                rural schools was that pupils from farming backgrounds tend not
                to take up free school meals because of the stigma attached to
                them. Another principal who gave evidence said that the spending
                levels did not appear to coincide with the educational needs of
                the youngsters in the school. Therefore, she found herself at a
                disadvantage when it came to providing additional facilities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Roy Beggs has already mentioned that the
                take-up of the provision of school meals is not a balanced
                indicator of social disadvantage. While only 9·2% of pupils in
                reception classes in controlled schools are entitled to free
                school meals, 18·9% of pupils in maintained schools are
                entitled to them. There is not even a balance in provision
                across education sectors. When the Committee considered this
                matter, there was criticism from all parties. A member of the
                Minister of Education’s party said:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;On the matter of free school meals, the
                Robson index, in my view, is a good enough indicator of social
                deprivation. In Fermanagh, for example, income levels are only
                70% of those in places such as England or other areas of the Six
                Counties. That is a statistic anyone can work on. There are
                people who will not claim free school meals, even though they
                are entitled to them.&quot;</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will not name the Member who said that,
                because he may be punished for going against his own Minister.
                However, that was the view of a Sinn Féin member of the
                Committee for Education.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Despite what Tommy Gallagher said, there are
                alternative measures. There are many diagnostic tests that can
                be done on a one-to-one basis, or collectively, that are not
                intrusive. There are tests that study people’s linguistic and
                mathematical development and their ability to understand rhyme.
                All of those are better indicators of educational need than the
                blunt instrument of the take-up of free school meals.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important to consider the alternatives
                because the system disadvantages rural schools, some education
                sectors and some boards. There is no evidence in the work of the
                Department to prove that the way in which funding is targeted
                gets to the nub of the problem and makes available to schools
                the resources that are required to deal with educational need.
                This indicator is a blunt instrument that the Department cannot
                stand over. The Department’s own report states that people do
                not take up this provision, so how can it be used as a measure?
                The system does not distribute equal amounts of money to all
                pupils or to the various types of schools. Therefore, it is
                important to consider a different way of dealing with this.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Even the blunt instrument of the Warnock
                indicator, which says that 10% of youngsters in every school
                will suffer some educational disadvantage, is a better measure
                of social disadvantage than free school meals. At least that
                indicator would ensure uniformity across schools and that
                schools received the required resources.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not think that the Minister will change
                his mind. Despite the compelling evidence and the fact that the
                Committee for Education asked him to look for alternatives, he
                has refused to reconsider because he has another agenda behind
                his method for distributing funding to schools.</p>

                I do not support the thrust of the motion. Mr Sammy Wilson would
                attack Sinn Féin’s position, as usual, but Mr Roy Beggs may
                have some genuine reasons for the points that he made. The
                thrust of the motion is purely sectarian, so I will not support
                it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">TSN is important to everyone, and we all want
                money to be allocated to deprived areas. Quite often, Members
                — including Sammy Wilson, a member of the Committee, who
                discussed Belfast schools — use questionable statistics.
                Jobseeker’s allowance entitlement and other measures of
                deprivation do not always combine to create the best formula.
                The Noble index takes various factors into account, and most
                areas do quite well under that formula. The indicator of free
                school meals entitlement identifies children from low-income
                families.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The percentage of children who are entitled
                to free school meals has been used to indicate the level of
                socio-economic disadvantage in schools. That figure also
                correlates strongly to low academic attainment and the
                percentage of young people who leave school with few, or no,
                formal qualifications. More recent statistics link free school
                meals entitlement with poor transfer test results. Pupils who
                are entitled to free school meals have, on average, lower GCSE
                grades. Average pass rates in leaving examinations are about 50%
                higher in post-primary schools at which less than 5% of children
                are entitled to free school meals, compared to those where 20%
                or more pupils qualify.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Pupils at schools in the lowest free school
                meals band are more than two and a half times more likely to
                achieve a grade A in the 11-plus test than those in the highest
                free school meals band. Moreover, as the population of pupils
                who are entitled to free school meals rises, so too does the
                proportion of pupils who do not sit the transfer test.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Beggs suggested that we replace free
                school meals entitlement with another indicator. The Ulster
                Unionist Party has argued that point for a long time, in
                Committees and elsewhere. Its argument is motivated not by a
                desire to find the best indicator of social need, but by
                sectarianism and a refusal to accept that the Catholic
                population experiences greater poverty and social need than
                Protestant people. One unhappy consequence of the Ulster
                Unionists’ campaign to have free school meals entitlement
                removed is that they are abandoning — <i>[Interruption].</p>

                Seventy-seven per cent of pupils at Malvern Primary School are
                eligible for free school meals; 70% of pupils at Blythefield,
                Beechfield, Currie, Edenbrooke and Avoniel primary schools
                qualify. There is a long list of schools with a high percentage
                of entitlement to free school meals, and most of them are state
                controlled. The percentage of free school meals entitlement in
                post-primary schools is high also. Over 60% of pupils at Mount
                Gilbert Community College and Templemore Controlled Secondary
                School qualify for free meals. Balmoral High School, Castle High

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will confine my remarks to the motion and
                the amendment. I will not go into detail as other Members have
                done; I am sure that people have taken the points on board.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am a member of two Committees — the
                Committee for Education and the Committee of the Centre. Both
                Committees have been investigating the targeting social need
                procedures from a number of aspects. All of the members of those
                Committees have agreed that while it is laudable in its
                intention, targeting social need is not as efficient or
                effective as it was designed to be. The Robson indices and the
                new, improved Noble indices, which determine the implementation
                of targeting social need, have been seen to be flawed. That
                means that areas of potential deprivation are ignored if they
                happen to be within larger, more prestigious areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In my local area there is a good example,
                which I have spoken about before. My constituency, North Down,
                the so-called &quot;gold coast&quot;, includes large estates
                where underdevelopment and deprivation are the norm. The high
                incidence of non-take-up of school meals in these areas, as in
                others, makes nonsense of the idea that free school meals should
                be the sole criterion for much wider assessment and judgement.
                Colleagues have made that point more specifically.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Research has proved that there are many
                parents who do not avail of free school meals for their
                children, even in the most deprived areas. Therefore, using free
                school meals as an indicator of deprivation is questionable. To
                put it in plain language, Members have a simple choice: we
                either face up to our responsibilities as legislators and do
                something to get the current system radically reviewed and, if
                necessary, changed, or we look the other way and ignore the
                plight of those more needy than ourselves.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An urgent review of the whole school meal
                procedure is long overdue. If we really want all children to
                enjoy the best facilities for their education, we must look more
                carefully at a wider and more reliable range of factors. As the
                amendment states, I suggest an in-depth review of how the
                criteria of social deprivation are measured in schools. The
                Minister would not refuse to consider such an evaluation. Such a
                review should be undertaken so that we have the best method of
                ensuring that all pupils, whatever their background, can avail
                of TSN programmes that will benefit their education.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Pending such a review, the whole process of
                targeting social need must be dealt with seriously and
                sensitively. However, it would be dangerous to fully support the
                motion until we are sure that any replacement — tests or
                otherwise — would be adequate and efficient enough to replace
                the current system. I support the amendment.</p>

                those indicators have outlined clearly that there is significant
                educational disadvantage, particularly in Protestant/Unionist
                communities.</p>

                process is not working. So why is the Department so keen to

                route he would ultimately have to put more money into the
                controlled sector and provide more for children in Unionist and
                Protestant areas. He often tells us how concerned he is about
                children on the Shankill Road, yet when it comes to providing
                funding for new schools, he will fund the schools in the
                controlled sector at about half the rate that he funds schools
                in the maintained sector. When it comes to TSN he will seek to
                have a mechanism in place that will target specifically schools

                totally strapped for cash, and significant choices must be made
                before the simplest work can be carried out. Many teachers are

                the North-Eastern Board area the same right as other children
                across the Province to excellent schooling with the proper
                number of teachers on board.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My constituency is divided in two with regard
                to provision. On the one hand there is Cookstown, which is in
                one education board area, and on the other hand there is
                Magherafelt, which is in the North-Eastern Education and Library
                Board area. There is, in the same constituency, a difference
                between the moneys that are available for schools. The main
                pressure is on Magherafelt, which is in the North-Eastern
                Education and Library Board area.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of course, it seems to be different in the
                maintained sector. The Minister is seldom in the constituency,
                although I am sure he receives news of it now and again.
                However, he knows full well that, as far as that constituency is
                concerned, although many of the schools in Magherafelt are
                falling apart, the new schools in the maintained sector are
                having millions of pounds spent on them. There is a great
                differential. In the Minister’s constituency, a different
                target for social need in the maintained sector from the one in
                the controlled sector seems to exist, even in relation to school
                provision.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I note with interest the remarks of Mr McHugh
                of the Minister’s party, Sinn Féin/IRA. He must have
                undergone a Saul of Tarsus-like conversion. I am sorry to link
                Saul with the said Member; when I get home to glory and speak to
                Saul I shall have to apologise to him. Does the Member think
                that we have not read the ‘Report on the Proposals for a
                Common Funding Formula for Grant-Aided Schools in Northern
                Ireland’? I noticed that there is a difference, and I shall
                tell the House what it is.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The minutes of evidence for Thursday 4
                October show that when the report was being prepared, questions
                asked and evidence given, Mr McHugh mentioned the Robson index.
                The interesting aspect is that he was probably not reading from
                a script then. Today, however, he was handed a script to ensure
                that he was brought into line and kept to party policy. I wonder
                whether he thought that the Robson index, which he commended in
                the report, was a sectarian proposal, because everything else in
                the mind of the Member seems to be a sectarian proposal. That is
                an interesting statement, coming from the most sectarian party
                in existence in the Western World, never mind in Northern
                Ireland. However, that party uses it whenever it suits.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There must be equality of funding. The
                present formula is not adequate and denies the rights of the
                children in my constituency to a proper education. I support the
                motion.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It seems to me that the motion does not
                suggest the abolition of free school meals as one of the
                criteria for the targeting of social need and for additional
                money for the education of those so targeted. It suggests that
                free school meals should be replaced as the sole criterion. That
                is important when one looks at that in conjunction with Mr
                Gallagher’s amendment. Mr Gallagher clearly accepted that free
                school meals was not, and should not be, the sole criterion for
                deciding whether the additional funding should be made
                available.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The amendment suggests that free school meals
                as the sole criterion is not the correct one. If it were the
                correct one, what need would there be for the substance of his
                amendment, which is to have the Department of Education, in
                consultation with the Committee for Education, carry out an
                in-depth review of the way in which social deprivation is
                measured?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It seems to me that the free school meals
                criterion is indeed a blunt instrument. I am sure that it was
                originally, and more accurately, intended to measure the
                nutritional situation of the pupils rather than their
                educational need. One can think of many instances in which a
                sharp child who was not getting as much nutrition as he required
                was nevertheless able to cope, and one can think of a child not
                so intellectually advantaged, but well fed and well looked
                after, who most definitely was in need of additional educational
                facilities and help. That is a situation in which this blunt
                instrument would not apply.</p>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is nonsense to suggest that someone, by
                virtue of his circumstances, who needs additional educational
                help is entirely congruent with someone who is not getting as
                much nutrition as he needs according to some standard. This
                clearly maintains the advantage of those who take maximum
                advantage of the benefits system. As long as that system is
                related to paying additional money for education, those who are
                on benefit and in areas where they have been on benefit and are
                determined to remain on benefit will get this extra money. Look
                at the figures which show that Catholic maintained schools
                account for 18·9% of uptake while controlled schools account
                for 9·2%. If anything shows the nonsense of free school meals
                as the sole criterion for TSN funding it is some of Mr McHugh’s
                figures. He mentioned a number of controlled primary schools,
                such as Blythe Street, Avoniel and others, that have an uptake
                of free school meals of over 70%.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One must ask if there is evidence to show
                that the increased funding those schools receive — and similar
                schools in the maintained sector too — is of benefit to them.
                Do they get better results? Do more children from those schools
                pass the 11-plus or transfer test? The answer is almost
                certainly no. There is no more damning criticism of the free
                school meal criterion than that. In areas of west Belfast, on an
                entirely different basis, 15% of the working population were on
                a disability benefit, a benefit that is not attributable to
                social conditions but to one’s physical condition, while in
                north Down only 3% of the working population were on it.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Shannon:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion. Many parents who live
                in the lower income bracket grew up receiving free school meals
                and probably had the school dinner stigma attached to them, and
                that is where the problem arose. Free school meals are a good
                way of ensuring that children from lower income families have at
                least one nutritious meal a day, and I heard someone making that
                point on the radio this morning. Unfortunately, receipt of free
                school meals alerts a child’s peers to his family’s
                financial situation; perhaps that has not happened so much in
                the recent past. When I was at school, children who received
                free school meals became the butt of many a child’s prank.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There must be a way of allocating TSN funding
                to education that does not embarrass children. Schooldays are
                tough enough for children without their being set out as
                different from the beginning so that the Department of Education
                can monitor the need for TSN funding.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many children who qualify for free school
                meals do not take them up because of the stigma attached to
                them. Targeting Social Need in education should not come down to
                how many free school meals are allocated in each area. Social
                need in education is an extensive issue and needs a more
                appropriate measuring tool. In the Strangford constituency there
                are pockets of affluence surrounded by areas of need. The two
                cancel each other out, and funding is missed out on, while the
                children of those two economic groups meet together at school on
                what should be a level playing field.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some children can afford to have tutors when
                they need extra help, but those who are unable to afford such
                tuition often fail, so social need funding allocations to
                education should be more academically based. In 65% of towns
                across Northern Ireland most people over 16 have no formal
                educational qualifications. In my constituency of Strangford,
                the Ballywalter, Comber, Kircubbin, Westwinds and Portaferry
                areas have a higher than average percentage of adults with no
                formal qualifications. Areas where most adults have formal
                qualifications are highly likely to be wealthy ones.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the most important indications of
                social need is overcrowding, and that applies to schools as much
                as to houses. We have all seen the indexes of overcrowding in
                towns and villages, but what about schools? Some children in the
                Strangford constituency have to pass one school to go to another
                because the catchment area of the first school is so
                oversubscribed that it cannot take children from the housing
                development that is only metres from it. The criteria for social
                need funding for education should take the overcrowding in
                classrooms into account.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If classrooms are overcrowded, it is only
                natural that the teaching will be less effective, as teachers
                dealing with over 30 students do not have time to devote to
                students who are struggling. Students who leave such schools may
                not achieve their full potential and may join the 65% of people
                here who have no formal qualifications — thus adding to social
                need, as those without qualifications find it harder to get a
                stable job that will support them and their families.
                Overcrowding in schools is a valid, highly graphic indicator of
                where funding should go in education. It directly influences the
                qualifications that young people have when leaving school.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we are to live together successfully,
                understanding and mutual respect are needed. That means
                eliminating the stigma and pain caused to children whose
                socio-economic backgrounds are revealed to their peers when they
                get free school meals. Funding must be allocated under criteria
                that show needs and areas of greatest need more efficiently and
                discreetly. Each community is different, so the criteria for
                funding must be adaptable so that those who get it will benefit
                from it. We need data that can be used to help children rather
                than categorise them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Every child must be given the same
                educational opportunities. By removing economic barriers,
                children will be able to gain qualifications that will remove
                any need for a TSN fund for them and society. However, that
                dream is a long way off, so we need to remove the stigmas and
                put money into the heart of the problem that we are trying to
                address.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Education (Mr M McGuinness):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank all Members who contributed to the
                debate. It is right that we should spend time addressing matters
                that most closely affect the daily lives of many people. Poverty
                has, for too long, blighted the lives of individuals and whole
                communities. The Programme for Government highlights New TSN as
                its major way of combating social exclusion and poverty. New TSN
                means targeting our efforts towards ensuring that programmes and
                services are delivered in ways that are most helpful to
                disadvantaged people, and I am totally committed to applying its
                principles to address social deprivation wherever it is found.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Department’s New TSN action plan
                concentrates on action that is designed to address the needs of
                children who are not achieving their full learning potential. As
                Mr Gallagher said, a substantial body of local and international
                research shows that there is a clear link between social
                disadvantage and low educational achievement. Children from
                socially disadvantaged circumstances tend to achieve less well
                at school, are less likely to stay on or enter further or higher
                education and in the future are more likely to be unemployed or
                work in lowly paid jobs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The purpose of the TSN element in the local
                management of schools (LMS) formula is to provide additional
                resources to help schools address low achievement,
                underachievement and pastoral care problems arising from the
                social and economic characteristics of their pupil intake.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some schools, particularly those with a high
                intake of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds, face
                considerable problems in the daily management and pastoral care
                of their pupils; however, it is clear that a substantial
                proportion of TSN costs in schools arise in addressing the needs
                of children who are performing below the level expected for
                their age. That can manifest itself in low motivation to learn,
                behavioural problems, poor attendance and low attainment.
                Research and experience have shown that those problems can be
                successfully overcome by school-based strategies such as special
                needs teaching, numeracy and literacy programmes, attendance and
                discipline initiatives, and home/school liaison arrangements.
                However, those measures require staff time and resources.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important to bear in mind that the
                consultation document on the local management of schools common
                formula proposed that TSN funding should continue to be based on
                two distinct elements: social deprivation, which is based on
                free school meals; and special educational need, which is based
                on measures of educational underachievement. Those who are in
                greatest need must be identified objectively and targeted
                fairly, regardless of gender, religion or race.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given that there is a clear correlation
                between social deprivation and low educational attainment, we
                need a robust and objective indicator that will enable us to
                direct our resources where they are most needed and where they
                will do most good in raising attainment levels. That will
                therefore give our most disadvantaged children the chance of a
                better life. Often, children do not attend a school in the area
                where they live. Pupils who live in areas that on a
                location-based indicator would be regarded as deprived often
                attend school in an area that is not so deprived, and vice
                versa. In addition, many pupils who live in one education and
                library board area cross board boundaries to attend schools that
                are situated in other board areas. For that reason,
                location-based indicators such as the Noble indicators, which
                are advocated by Roy Beggs Jnr and Edwin Poots, would not
                necessarily ensure that funding would be directed at those most
                in need.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Local and international research has
                confirmed that entitlement to free school meals is a robust
                indicator of social disadvantage among school pupils and is
                closely correlated with poor educational achievement. In the
                absence of any better, easily collected, readily updateable
                pupil indicator of social disadvantage, my Department will
                continue to use free school meals as a key means of targeting
                funding at schools with pupils with the greatest need. It is
                significant that the continued use of free school meals as an
                indicator of social deprivation was widely supported by schools
                in the recent consultation ‘A Common Funding Formula for
                Grant-Aided Schools’.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Roy Beggs Jnr, Tommy Gallagher, Sammy Wilson
                and others said that the uptake of entitlement to free school
                meals is not as high as it could be. My Department is keen to
                ensure that resources are directed towards the pupils in genuine
                need. The uptake of entitlement to free school meals will be
                researched in the family resources survey, which commenced in
                April of this year in conjunction with the Department for Social
                Development. The results will not be known until April 2003.
                Arrangements for determining entitlement to free school meals
                have traditionally mirrored those applicable in England, where
                consideration is being given to extending entitlement to include
                low-wage families in receipt of working families’ tax credit.
                If implemented, this will extend the coverage of the indicator.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Roy Beggs Jnr, Sammy Wilson and Eileen Bell
                spoke of the use of additional indicators for TSN. As I have
                said, research has found that entitlement to free school meals
                is a robust indicator of social disadvantage among school pupils
                and is closely correlated with poor educational achievement. The
                indicator or indicators used for social deprivation must be
                robust, objective and capable of being updated regularly as
                circumstances change. That narrows the field considerably;
                however, I am prepared to give careful consideration to the use
                of alternative indicators should they become available.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During today’s debate, as is typical in
                many of the debates that involve DUP Members, we hear the old

                communities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I refute absolutely any allegations of

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If those Members believe that there is
                discrimination, they are free to go to the Equality Commission
                or to the courts to seek redress. Why do they not do that? They
                do not do that because they know that they will not win.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These are important issues that affect all
                our children. Roy Beggs raised the issue of the proposals for
                the allocation of TSN funds within the local management of
                schools common funding formula. It is proposed to include
                educational indicators alongside entitlement to free school
                meals in allocating TSN funding, and to increase the proportion
                of TSN funding on educational need relative to social
                deprivation. That proposal is designed to take account of the
                extra support required by pupils who perform below the expected
                level for their age, regardless of their social background. The
                share of total funding allocated to TSN will also be increased
                from 5% to 5·5%. That will provide a further £4 million to
                help schools to provide additional educational support to
                underperforming pupils, while maintaining existing levels of
                support to schools with substantial numbers of disadvantaged
                pupils.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Roy Beggs and William McCrea raised the issue
                of the situation in the Northern-Eastern Education and Library
                Board area. As I have already stated, free school meals
                entitlement has been recognised for some time as the best
                available, and most robust, indicator of social deprivation in
                the education sector. Although I appreciate that the number of
                such pupils who attend North-Eastern Education and Library
                Board-funded schools is relatively low and has shown a
                relatively higher rate of decline recently compared with that of
                other board areas, the corollary is that North-Eastern Education
                and Library Board schools will, in general, face lower
                incidences of the problems, and the associated costs of
                addressing them, which stem from socially deprived pupils.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">William McCrea also raised the plight of
                controlled schools in the North-Eastern Education and Library
                Board area in relation to redundancies. Department of Education
                officials are working closely with the North- Eastern Education
                and Library Board to gather detailed information on its
                financial situation. Once that information is received, and the
                Department has completed its assessment, consideration will be
                given as to what steps to take next. The Department is
                progressing the issue of the financial pressures that face the
                North-Eastern Education and Library Board, and other education
                and library boards, with the utmost urgency.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sammy Wilson and Edwin Poots raised the issue
                of differentials in the levels of funding across boards. That
                will be addressed in due course in the common funding formula
                proposals. Sammy Wilson and Eileen Bell raised the issue of the
                stigma of claiming free school meals. I am as anxious as anybody
                else to ensure that resources are directed towards those pupils
                who have genuine need. The issue of the uptake of the
                entitlement to free school meals will, as I said, be researched
                in the family resources survey that started in April 2002 in
                conjunction with Department for Social Development. The results
                of that survey will not be known until April 2003.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">From my perspective, it is important to point
                out that the existing methodologies for distribution of funding
                across school sectors and among the five education and library
                boards includes the skewing of 5% of available resources based
                on the relative incidence of pupils who are entitled to free
                school meals. My Department initiated a review of the assessment
                of relative needs exercise methodologies that are used for the
                distribution of resources among boards. The review will include
                consideration of the most appropriate indicators of social need.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that what I have said will provide a
                measure of reassurance about my commitment to ensure that the
                problems of educational underachievement continue to be tackled
                seriously by ensuring that resources are targeted where they are
                most needed, irrespective of the community background of the
                children concerned.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I remain satisfied that entitlement to free
                schools meals remains the most robust indicator of social
                deprivation and, therefore, of the likelihood of educational
                underachievement. However, I am on record as having indicated my
                willingness to keep the issue under review and to consider using
                more effective indicators, should they become available. Very
                soon I shall write to the Committee for Education with the
                proposals that arise from the local management of schools
                consultation. I intend to work with the Committee in
                implementing the common formula.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Gallagher:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCartney referred to my admission that
                there were some shortcomings about the current use of the free
                school meals criterion. From that, he seemed to imply that I
                should support the motion and, therefore, that there was no need
                for an amendment. However, it is not as simple as that. The
                issue is social deprivation in education. Many Members said that
                social deprivation in education has implications for other
                aspects of life, not least employment opportunities. The purpose
                of the amendment is to reflect what the SDLP thinks about the
                issue, which is that we should be careful about how we proceed.
                We should be cautious and should certainly not be in a rush to
                introduce untried criteria, which is what the motion calls for.</p>
                <b>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will not give way during my winding-up
                speech.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion, according to some Members, is
                driven by concerns about the funding situation in the North-
                Eastern Education and Library Board area. I have great sympathy
                with a situation that affects so many parents, children and
                schools in that board area. However, it is not sensible to table
                a motion that states that resources should be taken from
                socially disadvantaged children in other board areas to address
                the situation in the North- Eastern Education and Library Board
                area. When North- Eastern Education and Library Board
                representatives came to the Committee for Education, they were
                clear that although the board faced difficulties, they did not
                want solutions that involved taking money from elsewhere in the
                education system to address their problems.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other Members referred to the Noble
                indicators, stating that they would be a better solution. They
                would not be a better solution because even though there are
                some shortcomings in using the free school meals criterion —
                and we must bear in mind that no system is perfect — the Noble
                indicators are residence-based. They are based on the
                circumstances in electoral wards and district council areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The world of education transcends the
                boundaries of electoral wards, and many children go to school in
                a different council area from the area in which they live.
                Bearing that in mind, there would be huge problems, inequalities
                and inconsistencies in any system that was based on the Noble
                indicators.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is encouraging that the Minister pointed
                out that research is ongoing on this issue and that the uptake
                of free school meals is being researched. Hence, the amendment
                is the right way to go. Both the Department and the Committee
                for Education will be involved in that debate until its
                conclusion in 2003.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Beggs:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I regret that I cannot support Mr Gallagher’s
                amendment, because it does not deal with the issues that I
                raised. It focuses only on social deprivation and does not
                recognise that educational need is inadequately addressed.
                Unless that need is dealt with, social deprivation will result.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sammy Wilson highlighted the need to balance
                social deprivation and educational needs. Although that might
                not have been the spirit of some Members’ contributions, it is
                the spirit of this motion. Furthermore, Sammy Wilson highlighted
                the variation in TSN pupil funding: it is up to £500 in the
                Belfast Education and Library Board area and up to £300 in
                other board areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I regret that Gerry McHugh and others
                attempted to play the sectarian card; that was not my motive.
                Although the North Eastern Education and Library Board has the
                second-lowest funding per pupil in both the primary school and
                secondary school sectors, grant-maintained schools in other
                board areas have the lowest funding. My motives are not
                sectarian, and I regret that some Members saw them as such. I
                simply seek equality in the distribution of funding. Nobody has
                given any justification for the 15% to 18% variation in funding
                for each pupil. I am sure that everyone agrees that social need
                should be targeted and that children in socially deprived areas
                should be helped, but that should not be done at the expense of
                others. Nobody responded to my question on the degree of
                funding. I am concerned at the Minister’s suggestion that we
                should increase TSN funding to 5·5%; however, I recognise that
                his intention was to direct the extra funding to address
                educational need. Nevertheless, I question the reduction of the
                budget for all schools.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I must admit that I appreciated the earlier
                comments of Mr McCartney, who did read my motion and appeared to
                understand its wording and the purpose of including the word
                &quot;sole&quot;. Others did not understand. Nowhere in the
                motion was it suggested that we should remove free school meals;
                in fact, I suggested that the facility should be extended to
                those who claim the working families’ tax credit, thus
                widening support for the working poor. Many of the working poor
                do not receive benefits, and we do not wish their children to be
                disadvantaged.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister expressed his wish to develop
                the full learning potential of all children and to develop
                programmes and services to help the most disadvantaged —
                surely that means the educationally deprived. That is why I
                stressed that in addition to addressing social deprivation, we
                must target those in educational need. There must be a balance,
                and it was in that spirit that I moved the motion.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister said that there are two factors:
                free schools meals entitlement and special education indicators.
                I wish to learn more of that, and I hope that he will do more
                than make statements about it. I hope that the real needs of
                those who do not receive funding will be dealt with and that
                educational needs will be addressed.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That this Assembly calls on the Assembly
                Commission to report to the Assembly by October 2002 on how
                symbols and emblems in Parliament Buildings will be used in a
                manner which promotes mutual respect rather than division within
                the new institutions as outlined in the Rights, Safeguards and
                Equality of Opportunity section of the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion is not about removing any of the
                symbols or emblems that adorn this Building and estate, nor is
                it about replacing one history with another. It is about
                fulfilling a provision of the Good Friday Agreement, which has
                been ignored to date.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion does not propose any immediate
                action, or prescribe how this Building or estate should be
                decorated. It simply proposes that the Assembly Commission,
                which has responsibility for these matters, examines the current
                range of symbols and emblems; takes account of the section in
                the Good Friday Agreement that deals with symbols and emblems in
                our new institutions and reports back to the Assembly in the
                autumn on how it proposes to fulfil those obligations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The provisions in the agreement regarding the
                new institutions were vital in securing the support of both
                communities for the establishment of the Assembly and other
                institutions. Nationalists, in particular, had deep concerns
                about the re-establishment of a Northern Assembly, given our
                historical experience under the old Stormont. Therefore,
                rigorous checks, balances, and guarantees had to be secured to
                ensure our participation in the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The concepts of power sharing, ministerial
                positions, Chairs and Deputy Chairs, as of right under d’Hondt,
                and the requirement for cross-community support for key
                decisions all point to the fact that this is a new and inclusive
                political dispensation in which the rights of both communities,
                and others, are protected. All who signed up to the agreement
                have a duty to protect and promote that inclusiveness.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Building in which the Assembly is
                currently located is of significant historical importance, and
                obviously has significant historical attachment for Unionists.
                The Stormont estate and Parliament Buildings quite clearly
                reflect to the world the expressed desire of the creators for a
                Protestant Parliament for a Protestant people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Visitors, staff, and Members approach the
                Building up the Prince of Wales Avenue, past the statue of
                Edward Carson, who, contrary to the amendment from the DUP, has
                a rather dubious connection to the parliamentary history of this
                Building. They enter the Building under the statue of Britannia,
                and not one but two union flags on designated days, and then
                face the statue of Craigavon at the top of the Stairs. The tomb
                of Craigavon is located at the side of the Building, and there
                are many other British and Unionist symbols built into the
                fabric of the Building.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All of this accurately reflects the
                historical background of this location. As an Irish Republican I
                have no allegiance to that, but I am not proposing that they be
                eradicated. I am asking the Assembly Commission to reflect on
                how the Building and estate can reflect their current position
                in Irish history, and, in doing so, make this a place in which
                all people feel a sense of ownership.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I acknowledge the steps already taken by the
                Speaker and others. The adoption of the flax flower as the
                symbol of the Assembly was an important first step. The Speaker
                has been pursuing other steps. The statue unveiled by the First
                Minister and the Deputy First Minister in the estate, arguably
                open to cynical misinterpretation, and the planting of 108 trees
                also highlight the new inclusive nature of our political
                institutions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those developments are very much ad hoc. Four
                years after we adopted this location, Parliament Buildings and
                the estate still very much reflect a British and Unionist ethos.
                The Commission must address this in a structured and proactive
                way.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The DUP amendment, even more so than my
                motion, depicts what needs to be done so that our institutions
                visually reflect the principles that underpin them. Those who
                are against the agreement, power sharing and the checks and
                balances that ensure that everyone in the community has a stake
                in these institutions unsurprisingly want the symbols and
                emblems of this place to reflect their tradition, and their
                tradition alone, for all time. They are consistent in their
                opposition to Nationalists or Republicans having any meaningful
                share in these institutions, although they are happy to adopt d’Hondt
                and accept our support on various councils throughout the North
                when it comes to securing positions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Anyone who supports the agreement should
                accept that the dominance of one community over the other has
                been consigned to the past. Our new political institutions
                should reflect that reality. I have heard Members from all
                pro-agreement parties applaud the inclusive nature of our
                institutions and stress the importance of that in their success
                to date. We have a duty to reflect that to all who work in and
                visit this Building and estate by ensuring that there is an
                equal welcome for all. This does not threaten anyone who
                supports the agreement, and it does not even threaten anyone who
                does not support the agreement. I look forward to the support of
                all Members for the motion. Go raibh maith agat.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Campbell:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I beg to move the following amendment: In
                line 1 delete all after &quot;to report to the Assembly&quot;
                and insert:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;on how any additional symbols and
                emblems can reflect the parliamentary history of Parliament
                Buildings and the Stormont Estate.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is one relatively unimportant matter
                that we should deal with at the outset: the timing referred to
                in the motion is obviously totally unrealistic given the few
                weeks that remain in this session and the several weeks that
                precede the commencement of the autumn session of the House. For
                that reason, our amendment would delete the reference to the
                date. In the wider scheme of things, that is relatively
                unimportant.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The amendment tries to deal with the issue by
                looking past the discriminatory and offensive nature of the
                Belfast Agreement. We seek to go beyond the agreement, which is
                endorsed by 98% of the Nationalist community and opposed by over
                50% of the Unionist community, and what it seeks to achieve.
                Anything that was built on or arose out of the Belfast Agreement
                would be tainted and scarred in the eyes of the Unionist
                community because of how it was structured to benefit one
                section of the community — and it certainly was not the
                Unionist section. We want to look beyond that, and for that
                reason our amendment would also delete that reference from the
                motion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I now turn to what we would like to see in
                any amended proposition. There are several features in
                Parliament Buildings and the estate. Many of those symbols,
                statues and emblems pertain to the founding of Northern Ireland,
                as do many emblems and statues in Parliaments of other
                countries, for example, in the Irish Republic, Westminster and
                other parliamentary grounds throughout the European Union and in
                the wider world. A building of any historic merit will have
                statutes and emblems that pertain to the origins of the
                particular state that the Parliament has been established to
                govern.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.45 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Northern Ireland is no different. We had
                those statutes and emblems, and they are still in place today.
                They do not reflect the Unionist view of life. That is where we
                see the deliberate mistake in the proposal for change by Sinn
                Féin/IRA. It wants to misconstrue the origins of Northern
                Ireland as essentially and exclusively Unionist in outlook.
                Unfortunately, it became Unionist because those who said that
                they would have nothing to do with it boycotted it and attempted
                to undermine it. As I said, the origins of the state were not
                explicitly and exclusively Unionist.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are statues in the Dublin Parliament
                that reflect the origins of that state, and I wait with interest
                moves in the Irish Republic to put in place new symbols and
                emblems to reflect the British tradition that existed there
                before it was forced out and before the 10% became 2%. I have
                not heard of any. Perhaps they are being made now; perhaps the
                Dáil is deliberating at great length, as we speak, over what
                British emblems will be put in place at its entrance. If it is,
                I wait with interest to hear what they will be. The truth is
                that I have not heard of any such moves. That gives some sort of
                context to the suggestions from Sinn Féin/IRA today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, we must look to the future. We have
                looked at what may be examined in the future in terms of the
                parliamentary history of this Building and this estate, which
                were not the exclusive preserve of the Unionist tradition. Many
                Nationalists frequented this Building: Eddie McAteer was the MP
                for Mid Londonderry from 1953 to 1969; Paddy Maxwell was the MP
                for Foyle from 1937 to 1953; Joe Stewart was the MP for East
                Tyrone from 1929 to 1964, and that was some longevity. There are
                some accusations about people having long terms of office at the
                moment, but Mr Stewart managed 35 years, and that was no mean
                achievement. Then there was Senator James Lennon from 1944 to
                1972 and Senator Paddy McGill from 1953 to 1972. Many
                Nationalists were either MPs in the previous Stormont Parliament
                or in the Senate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While I am not suggesting that any or all of
                them should be included, that shows that we did not have an
                exclusively Unionist Parliament in Stormont for 50 years. If our
                amendment is successful, I hope that the Commission will examine
                what possibilities could emerge to reflect our parliamentary
                history as it affected the entire community. There could be
                photographs, a statute or whatever. We are not being
                prescriptive about what ought to be put in place.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The failure to put in place emblems and
                symbols like that comes up from time to time, and it is
                presented as showing some form of antagonism, opposition or
                bigotry towards the Nationalist community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would much prefer an earnest seeking of a
                replica of the parliamentary history of this Building to be put
                in its proper place so that due cognisance could be given to its
                history and culture. I would rather have that than the approach
                of those who put up symbols only to undermine them. We have seen
                examples of that in some councils in Northern Ireland. I would
                much prefer a realistic approach that can give genuine
                recognition to the parliamentary history of Unionism and of
                Nationalism in this Building and on the Stormont estate.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion speaks of the aspiration towards
                mutual respect, and that seems fine; however, we question the
                motion’s intent. I hope that we all favour truly fair
                employment, equality of opportunity and, indeed, the mutual
                respect mentioned in the motion. Nevertheless, we must think
                about what the motion would mean in practice. Is it about
                building or destroying?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The mover of the amendment, Mr Campbell,
                rightly drew parallels with the Dáil and its symbolic, if
                limited, representations. We need not fear for Parliament
                Buildings if that is the comparison. Perhaps, ultimately, the
                intention of the motion, although it is not stated, is to draw a
                misguided parallel with what happened in Eastern Europe and the
                former Soviet Union since 1989 and 1991, where statues of Lenin
                and Stalin and other representatives of the now discredited
                Communist regime have been toppled. Perhaps it refers to the
                removal of statues, pictures and other symbolic representations
                of British colonial rule in countries such as India since 1947.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion’s attempt to base that intention
                on the section on rights and safeguards and equality of
                opportunity in the Belfast Agreement cannot properly speak on
                the issue of flags, although the proposer referred to flags
                flying from the top of this Building. That part of the Belfast
                Agreement spoke only of symbols and emblems. Legally, it
                excluded the national flag, which remains an excepted matter for
                the Westminster Parliament under the Flags (Northern Ireland)
                Order 2000.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a case for adding rather than
                removing or vandalising historical symbols. Indeed, the proposer
                of the amendment has implied some ways forward. Therefore we
                shall oppose the motion and support the amendment.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Roche:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The objective of the motion is to make
                Stormont into a location for commemorating the activists and
                activities of IRA/Sinn Féin. That must not be permitted. That
                is not to deny a proper mutual respect between citizens of the
                United Kingdom. However, IRA/Sinn Féin wishes to promote by the
                use of emblems and symbols what no normal human being would ever
                consider worthy of respect.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To allow IRA/Sinn Féin to celebrate and
                commemorate the activities of its activists would amount to
                permitting the celebration and commemoration of mass murder and
                terrorism that took place for over thirty years. That is a point
                that I want to illustrate in detail. Whether this motion would
                ever be acceptable is going to be determined by a clear
                understanding of what those symbols and emblems would be
                commemorating.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">IRA/Sinn Féin activists were engaged in many
                incidents that the IRA/Sinn Féin’s use of symbols and emblems
                in this Building would intend to obliterate from the collective
                memory of the citizens of Northern Ireland. In Belfast on 21
                July 1972 the IRA detonated 20 bombs in an hour and killed nine
                people. Peter Taylor in his book ‘Provos’ provides an
                eyewitness account of what happened. It says:</p>

                commemorated in a Parliament would be unthinkable in any normal
                political system, but the Belfast Agreement did not establish a
                normal political system. It established a political system that
                elevated the perpetrators of the murderous activity of IRA/Sinn
                Féin into the Government of Northern Ireland. That is the
                judgement of leading experts on IRA/Sinn Féin terrorists.</p>

                you, Mr Roche. I am listening carefully because I feel that at
                times you are straying from the motion.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No, Mr Deputy Speaker. I take from what you
                are saying that you are having difficulty following a very
                simple argument. If Members are ever going to permit the sort of
                symbols and emblems wanted by the Member who moved the motion,
                they must be aware of what they would be celebrating and trying
                to commemorate. That is why I am giving the examples.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Belfast Agreement has elevated the
                perpetrators of this murderous activity into the Government of
                Northern Ireland. That is the judgement of leading experts on
                IRA/Sinn Féin terrorism. Liam Clarke, for example, in his
                recent book on the current Minister of Education states that</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Martin McGuinness who was in overall
                command of both the Army Council and the Northern Command gave
                permission to the Fermanagh units to attack a number of
                Remembrance Day ceremonies including Enniskillen.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is the sort of activist and activity
                that would be commemorated if the motion were carried in this
                Building.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In their book on Gerry Adams, David Sharrock
                and Mark Devenport — two of the most respected political
                journalists operating in Northern Ireland — state
                categorically that Gerry Adams was among the planners of Bloody
                Friday.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have already given an eyewitness account of
                what happened on that horrendous day. These are the IRA/ Sinn
                Féin activists who have been elevated and legitimised by the
                Belfast Agreement. The Belfast Agreement, therefore, carries the
                logic of what the motion proposes. The only way to effectively
                oppose the legitimisation of IRA/Sinn Féin terrorism — which
                is what the motion is really about — is to effectively
                repudiate the Belfast Agreement that requires that
                legitimisation. The effective repudiation of the Belfast
                Agreement is the major task that still confronts authentic
                Unionism, and our contribution today will be to oppose the
                motion and refrain from supporting the amendment.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCartney:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I oppose the motion. I have listened
                carefully to what the previous Member to speak has said, and I
                endorse most of his sentiments. What are the alleged
                institutions of this place? It is alleged to be some pale copy
                of a parliamentary democracy operating upon the usual democratic
                principles: that it is the right of a majority of people to
                elect a Government, and if that Government fails to deliver, to
                discharge them and elect another.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The circumstances in which the institutions
                of this place came about are the total negation of that
                fundamental principle. Nevertheless, one must assume that this
                place would wish to take on some of the attributes of what we
                term &quot;representative democracy&quot;.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An examination of the history of this place,
                and such symbols as are claimed to exist, would, I suppose,
                include the statues of Carson and Craigavon as the two most
                evident symbols of its history. Both men were distinguished
                parliamentarians, and both supported the democratic process.
                When Carson gave up his position as leader of the Ulster
                Unionist Party he exhorted the party to take from the Roman
                Catholic fellow citizens all that was best in them, to do
                justice and fairness to them and to ensure that they
                participated. I see a sneering Mr Dallat, but, of course, Carson
                was not a sectarian bigot. Craigavon was also a distinguished
                parliamentarian.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What is proposed by the motion? It is to put
                down as a marker the parliamentary activity of Sinn Féin/IRA? I
                could envisage some distinguished Nationalists such as the late
                Paddy Devlin being represented in this Building. Paddy was a
                child of the Falls Road, a former IRA man who was arrested and
                interned. However, I knew Paddy personally, and as he matured he
                became a democrat in the purest sense. I would willingly support
                some memento or mark of respect to the late Paddy Devlin.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, what would be proposed on behalf of
                Sinn Féin/IRA? Should we have murals depicting their heroic
                achievements at Kingsmills, when they separated 10 Protestant
                non-political workers like goats from the single Roman Catholic
                sheep and gunned them down?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Should we have a depiction of a bread server
                being shot in the back as he carries bread into his shop? Should
                we have an artistic representation of a bomb being planted
                outside Harrods or the Old Bailey, blowing an innocent
                consultant anaesthetist to destruction and destroying the lives
                and mutilating the bodies of many others? Should we have a
                memento of a schoolteacher being dragged out in front of his
                pupils and gunned down by a hero of the Sinn Féin/IRA
                revolution? Would those be, in any way, a proper record or
                acknowledgement of the parliamentary and democratic process of
                those who claim to be democrats? Democrats they are not.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They have achieved their position as
                Ministers and representatives in this place out of the gun
                barrel and the explosion. When a minority political party that
                is supported by terrorists fails to achieve through the
                democratic process, because it cannot impose its will or its
                policies upon a majority in a democratic process, it resorts to
                violence. A weak and pathetic British Government, in order to
                protect what they saw as their first-class citizens on the
                mainland, was suborned into granting it places in Government.
                Should those who have been instrumental in the murder of over
                2,500 of our citizens be memorialised in this place as
                supporters of the democratic process or even of a pale replica
                of that process? I think not.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some Members say that to make a terrorist
                feel at home, to make him feel equal, to make his dastardly and
                horrendous deeds a proper subject of memory and to make him feel
                good about himself, he should be given a place in something that
                claims to be a democratic institution. I think not. There is no
                way that the success of armed and horrendous terrorism should be
                elevated as a power by those who have pledged themselves to the
                democratic process.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We forget so easily. We forget that Mark
                Durkan, now the Deputy First Minister, recognised the basis of
                Sinn Féin/IRA success when two senior officials at Weston Park
                said to him &quot;The reason that you do not get your plans
                implemented and Sinn Féin does is that you have no guns&quot;.
                That is not from a Unionist; it is from the SDLP Deputy First
                Minister. Nonetheless, that philosophy of terror, threat,
                murder, mutilation and destruction is now offered to us as an
                objective or success that should be engraved in these
                institutions. If it is the mind of this House, not only of
                Unionists but of the SDLP, that such memorials be erected in
                this Building, the SDLP and the Unionists, and anyone else who
                supports it, will be giving a spurious validity to the success
                of murderous terrorism. No matter how they may attempt to
                finesse it or excuse it by nuance or weasel words, they will be
                partners in crime.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If Members have any democratic resolution, as
                I believe many of them do, then it is the duty of the SDLP and
                every other party to oppose the motion.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McNamee:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion, which is hardly
                surprising. I will speak to that motion, although I am not sure
                which motion some other Members have been speaking to.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Perhaps the word &quot;neutral&quot; is not
                the best word to describe the purpose and spirit of the motion.
                I do not believe that anyone is proposing that the historical
                and cultural artefacts and symbols be removed from the fabric of
                the Building. I do not believe that Parliament Buildings should
                become bereft of things that reflect the history of this part of
                Ireland. Surely, Members do not want to work in a bland,
                anonymous place that has no character or cultural quality.
                Indeed, some of the corridors in the Building are absent of
                anything except the bare walls, doors, ceiling and floor.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Parliament Buildings is part of the public
                face of Ireland, and, in particular, it is part of the public
                face of this part of Ireland. The Building is the public face of
                the Assembly and should reflect the cultural diversity of the
                people who work here. Of course, when I refer to people who work
                here, I include Assembly Members — some of whom work long
                hours on a daily basis, although sometimes the media would have
                us believe otherwise.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The greater number of visitors to Ireland
                take the opportunity to visit the Building as part of their
                itinerary. Their visit will form part of their impression of
                this island and of this part of Ireland. It will also form an
                impression of the people who live here. They should not get the
                impression from a bland, anonymous building that we are a bland,
                anonymous people who have no sense of the importance of our
                political and cultural history. Mr Esmond Birnie said that the
                motion is about subtraction and destruction. That is not what it
                is about. It is about creating a balance and promoting mutual
                respect.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The symbols, emblems and statues in the
                Building reflect the cultural and political identity of one
                section of the community — the Unionist community. I work in
                the Building, and I am, therefore, entitled to a balanced
                working environment. A balance does not exist that reflects the
                cultural diversity of the people who live in this region and the
                people who work in Parliament Buildings. The motion is intended
                to address that imbalance of symbols and emblems as envisaged in
                the Good Friday Agreement, which was intended to engender parity
                of esteem and mutual respect for the identity and ethos of both
                communities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The amendment seeks to reduce the motion to
                the extent that it would call on the Assembly Commission to
                report on how additional symbols and emblems can reflect the
                paramilitary history — Freudian slip — parliamentary history
                of Parliament Buildings and the Stormont Estate, and to have a
                very narrow focus on its history. The history of this Building,
                as some Members admitted, has not been inclusive and does not
                reflect the entire community.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of course, I have the right to change my
                mind. We are told that we wish to misconstrue the origins of the
                state as being Unionist. The British Government imposed
                partition against the will of the vast majority of people on
                this island. Is it any wonder that Nationalists chose to abstain
                and reject the institutions that flowed from that? Parity of
                esteem and mutual respect for the identity and ethos of both
                communities are not reflected in the symbols and emblems of this
                Building.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proposers of the amendment are opposed to
                the Good Friday Agreement and do not want things to change.
                However, Unionists who supposedly support the Good Friday
                Agreement — or the Belfast Agreement, if they wish to call it
                that — should grow up. The Good Friday Agreement was reached
                four years ago in 1998. It is time that pro-agreement Unionists
                were out of their nappies and showed their support for the
                implementation of the Good Friday Agreement by supporting the
                motion. Go raibh maith agat.</p>

                &quot;in a manner which promotes mutual respect&quot;. It would
                be a responsible gesture by Sinn Féin if it showed respect for
                the emblem of this state by acknowledging it and not
                continuously trying to get rid of it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">References are often made to a neutral

                Union flag, is taken away, as in Fermanagh District Council.
                Indeed, it is extremely hostile to everybody when the emblem of
                their jurisdiction is not respected and flown with dignity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is a preposterous situation when the flag
                or symbol of a jurisdiction can be removed by a majority vote in
                a council chamber within that jurisdiction. I am questioning the
                motive behind the motion. It very much seems that anything
                British is no longer seen as part of our history but is said to
                be offensive. That is the kind of scene and agenda that Sinn
                Féin seeks to promote. If it can happen in Fermanagh, it could

                hypocritical can one become? All of this is so sad. It is really
                an attempt to take over and undermine by pretentious means. In
                fact, it is war by another method because the armed struggle
                failed in its intent, but it scarred many, sadly. The action of
                Fermanagh District Council is offensive to many people.</p>

                someone who respects the flag of the jurisdiction one may be
                visiting or residing in. The motion refers to the rights,
                safeguards and equality of opportunity section of the Belfast
                Agreement. Sinn Féin is in Stormont and is very enthusiastic
                about the workings of the Assembly. It has two Ministers with
                Executive portfolios, who, acting on behalf of Her Majesty,
                introduce Bills for approval, with the realisation that a Bill
                accepted by the Assembly must have Her Majesty’s Royal Assent
                before it becomes an Act.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is also agreed that, under the terms of
                the agreement, David Trimble is basically a Unionist prime
                minister in the Province of Northern Ireland and that Mark
                Durkan is deputy prime minister. All the signatories to the
                agreement have accepted that. If any party continues to rail at
                such an arrangement, then it is failing to fulfil the
                requirements of the agreement, the full implementation of which
                it regularly calls for. None can cherry-pick.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is time to realise what section 1 of the
                Northern Ireland Act 1998 states. The words are</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;It is hereby declared that Northern
                Ireland in its entirety remains part of the United Kingdom and
                shall not cease to be so without the consent of a majority of
                the people of Northern Ireland voting in a poll held for the
                purposes of this section in accordance with Schedule 1.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not aware of any poll having been held
                to change that or show that the majority of people think
                otherwise. The continued railing in the Chamber about our status
                contributes to the regrettable street violence turned to by our
                divided society.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Republican movement continually contends
                that the agreement should be fully implemented, so why can
                Republicans not fully conform to its terms? It comes back to
                respect. The agreement that was recognised and accepted
                contained the wording to which I referred. Moreover, it must be
                realised that we are part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain
                and Northern Ireland, not by any privilege, but by right. The
                geography of the British Isles, with British-Irish,
                British-English, British-Welsh and British-Scots, makes us all
                on these islands members of one family. &quot;Parity of
                esteem&quot; means parity of esteem in, but not of, the system.
                One sovereignty is evident — that of Her Majesty Queen
                Elizabeth II. There is no joint sovereignty, as some people
                seek. Stop trying to change in midstream that which was accepted
                on Good Friday 1998.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In referring to the situation, I wish not to
                taunt or to jibe but to spell out the facts of the situation now
                obtaining. There is a need for honesty in these days of
                continued strife in parts of our community. Should such violence
                continue, it will be upon the shoulders of those who fail to
                uphold the agreement to which they adamantly adhere when
                expounding their theories.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Ulster Unionist Party has fully
                implemented its part of the agreement. We seek peace and
                prosperity for all in the Province. I come from a working-class
                background and am aware of the difficulties of trying to live.
                Sinn Féin constantly perpetuates strife and division and
                creates physical, mental and emotional deprivation. It is also
                contrary to the aims of the agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Actions speak louder than words. If equality
                as a citizen is the demand, Sinn Féin and others must, as
                citizens, demonstrate their responsibilities to this state. Now
                is not the time to destroy or disrupt but to work together for
                the benefit of the state, and mutual respect will evolve.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Attwood:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I refer first to Gregory Campbell’s
                amendment. Although we will not support it, I acknowledge that
                his intention does not seem to be to do to this Building what
                others do to the streets of Belfast and beyond. Areas are staked
                out by one paramilitary group or another in a territorial war
                against the interests of the citizens and communities of those
                areas. At least this Building is not going to be reduced to what
                we have around the North, with flags and bunting and with
                kerbstones decked out in the colours of one or other side.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">His speech was, nonetheless, curious. He said
                that he wanted real and genuine recognition of Unionism and
                Nationalism in this Building and invoked the memory of various
                people who did or did not abstain from the Stormont Parliament.
                The words in the amendment are</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;the parliamentary history of Parliament
                Buildings and the Stormont Estate.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If that is the desired principle, should the
                experience of Nationalism in this Building and in Parliament
                since partition not be reflected? According to Mr Campbell’s
                argument, should this Building not record the Nationalist
                experience under the Special Powers Act of 1922, and such other
                Nationalist experiences as being excluded from Government, of
                gerrymandering in council areas throughout the North and of
                internment as endorsed by the Parliament that once sat here?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If Members wish to seriously reflect the
                parliamentary history of Parliament Buildings and the Stormont
                Estate, they must move beyond the personalities who once
                occupied seats in a former Chamber. They must allow us, in line
                with their argument, to record the real experience of
                Nationalism and Unionism in the past 80 years, which was,
                including for Unionists, inconsistent with good government and
                good policy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A second curious element of Gregory Campbell’s
                speech was that he encouraged the other Parliament on this
                island, Dáil Éireann, to accept the principle whereby that
                which was British in the history of Ireland should be greater
                reflected in the symbols and emblems displayed there. If he is
                prepared to ask the Dáil to reflect Britishness in its Chamber
                and Buildings, he must accept that the same principle should
                apply in this Chamber and in this Building. If he thinks that
                one Parliament should acknowledge the diversity of the people on
                the island, as he sees it, he should accept that this Parliament
                and this Building should also reflect the diversity of the
                people on this part of the island. I doubt that certain Members
                will accept that that principle should apply here, even though
                they encourage its application elsewhere.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As always, Robert McCartney gave Members
                insight into his personal thinking and political culture. He
                reads his worst fears into any principle that appears to
                recognise the parity of esteem of political traditions,
                especially Nationalism. Those worst fears are that abuses of
                human rights, visited upon the citizens and communities of
                Northern Ireland by Republican paramilitaries, will be
                memorialised in this place. That approach is central to Robert
                McCartney’s political philosophy. He reads into proposals that
                might be sensible and reasonable that which is worst and most to
                fear. On behalf of my party, I advise Robert McCartney, and any
                Members who read into the motion their worst fears, that that is
                not the SDLP’s intention. Nor is it the desired outcome that
                it would want to see from the Commission should the motion be
                passed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Roche took a similar view to Mr McCartney.
                He said that with the Belfast Agreement comes the logic of the
                promotion and elevation of terrorism in the North. I do not
                agree. The Belfast Agreement ensures that no part of our
                community, whether Loyalist or Republican, will feel so
                alienated, frustrated or damaged that it feels justified in
                reverting to the use of arms to convey a political message or
                effect political change. The Good Friday Agreement creates the
                context, basis and framework in which the logic of terrorism is
                not fulfilled but in which the logic of democracy prevails.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.30 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion is about the logic of democracy in
                a divided society. That logic says that those divided and in
                conflict must respect one another. That is what the motion is
                about, not what Mr Roche seems to think.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, in one way I sympathise with
                Unionists’ points, particularly Mr Foster’s. Sinn Féin says
                in the motion that it wants to promote mutual respect rather
                than division; it says that that should be done in Parliament
                Buildings through the use of symbols and emblems. If Sinn Féin
                accepts that there should be mutual respect rather than division
                on those issues, let it apply those principles to all symbols
                and emblems wherever they are in the North. As we know — <i>[Interruption].</p>
                </i><b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Campbell:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does that include the South?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Attwood:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That means anywhere on this island. We know
                that in Republican symbols and emblems to those whom they call
                their dead there is little that promotes mutual respect rather
                than division. How have Republicans promoted mutual respect in
                the expression of their war memorials, as they put it? Where in
                flouting the law by erecting illegal memorials have they shown
                mutual respect rather than division? Where have they, through
                constructing memorials that elevate those who visited grief and
                grievance on so many across the political divide over the past
                30 years shown mutual respect rather than division? Sinn Féin
                may feel that its people have lost greatly, but where does it
                acknowledge in its memorials that it has also inflicted greatly?
                In failing to acknowledge that, how does that party promote
                mutual respect rather than division?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For our purposes, the SDLP supports the

                clarify his party’s stance? That may be helpful to those
                Members on either side of the motion who will wind up the

                and I am sure that he will say in his response that he knows the
                answer.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In supporting the motion, I shall outline its
                real intentions. Some Members have read their worst fears into
                it; some have promoted it but have done so selectively, as Sinn
                Féin has demonstrated. In supporting the motion, we are trying
                to ensure that Government buildings express equality,
                independence and impartiality. We are trying to design
                Government buildings that create, and are seen to create,
                confidence in the administration of Government. They should
                proclaim parity of esteem and inspire public confidence in
                equality of treatment. Those are the best intentions behind the
                motion, and I commend it to the House.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Weir:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In winding up on the amendment, I should like
                to deal with a few points that the previous Member raised. I am
                glad that towards the end of his speech he clarified whether the
                SDLP would yet again fall in behind Sinn Féin.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The &quot;Most Oppressed People Ever (MOPEs)&quot;,
                as Ruth Dudley Edwards called them, have treated us to another
                diatribe, but the Member has clearly not dealt with the salient
                points of the motion. We are told that inclusiveness is the real
                spirit behind the motion; we are told that Unionists who are
                concerned that this will be an open door to terrorist memorials
                in this Building are merely expressing their worst fears.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The concern of Mr McNamee, one of the
                supporters of the motion, is that the amendment has a narrow
                focus, yet it would cater for a degree of representation for
                parliamentarians who were constitutional Unionists,
                constitutional Nationalists and those who describe themselves as
                of the third tradition in Northern Ireland, be that Alliance or
                Labour. So if the amendment includes those people, why has it
                too narrow a focus? Who is not included? Clearly, the
                representatives of Republican and Loyalist terrorism are not —
                and our worst fears have been realised.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Attwood was not 100% clear on our view of
                Dáil Éireann: we do not care what happens there. It is a
                different jurisdiction and, frankly, if they want to put a
                100-foot-high tricolour on Dáil Éireann, that is a matter for
                them. We were making the point that the Republic of Ireland does
                not represent the British tradition.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Phrases appear in the motion which make alarm
                bells ring. Many groups use the word &quot;justice&quot; in
                their title, and that raises suspicions about their motives. In
                the old Eastern bloc, any country that used the word
                &quot;democratic&quot; in its title was the antithesis of that
                quality. When Sinn Féin/IRA uses the phrases &quot;equality of
                opportunity&quot; and &quot;neutral working environment&quot;,
                that is the last we will see of them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is this a question of a &quot;neutral working
                environment&quot;? I contend not. The Assembly was set up four
                years ago, yet the representatives of Sinn Féin/IRA, their
                staff and supporters have had no problem going round and working
                in this Building. Every Christmas, a large party is thrown here.
                So oppressive is the regime to Sinn Féin/IRA that it has taken
                it four years to remember that Parliament Buildings is
                supposedly not a neutral environment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But this is not the real purpose of the
                motion. This is about cultural imperialism and cultural
                intolerance. When Republicans are in control, they remove
                symbols of Britishness, to destroy that tradition. We do not
                need to look as far as the Republic of Ireland to see that
                cultural imperialism; Sam Foster spoke about what Sinn Féin has
                delivered in Fermanagh. Someone once described it as a dog
                marking out its territory. Where it can, it removes symbols of
                Britishness, and where it is not in the majority, it falls back
                on the next option, which is to declare that there must be
                equality between Irish Republicanism and the state that we are
                in.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have no desire to live in a society that
                destroys symbols, including the symbols around this Building. We
                do not want to create, as Sinn Féin clearly does despite its
                protestations today, a Northern Ireland Taliban let loose to
                destroy the historic symbols of this Building. That is what
                would happen if the motion were passed. This is a clear attempt
                to score political points. Sinn Féin has tolerated the
                situation for four years, and suddenly these issues have to be
                resolved in four months — is it trying to score some early
                election points?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The amendment, by contrast, is open-ended by
                time, and due reflection can be given to the best way in which
                to reflect the parliamentary tradition of the Building properly.
                Unlike the motion, the amendment does not aim to attack the
                Britishness of this part of the United Kingdom, though I have
                grave concerns that some Unionists have signed up to an
                agreement which is, bit by bit, diminishing that Britishness.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Irrespective of varying interpretations of
                the Belfast Agreement, the DUP will not sign up to any system
                that creates a dimmer-switch form of Britishness, whereby bit by
                bit it becomes darker and colder for the Unionist community in
                Northern Ireland. We will not support any motion that diminishes
                and destroys the symbols of Britishness in the Chamber or
                anywhere else.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are told constantly by those who moved the
                motion that they do not wish to destroy any of the existing
                symbols or emblems in Parliament Buildings, so why did they
                object to the amendment’s focus on additional symbols? The
                amendment aims to protect the existing symbols and to show
                respect to the distinguished parliamentarians who are honoured
                in this Building. The amendment would not destroy or subtract;
                it would produce additional symbols.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The amendment would allow symbols that
                recognise only the parliamentary history of this Building. It
                therefore makes an appropriate distinction between
                constitutional politicians, and terrorists and gangsters —
                Paddy Roche, Bob McCartney, Gregory Campbell and others made
                that point. Given that it is impossible to be a proper
                parliamentarian and to be linked to terrorism, and that both
                sides clearly reject terrorism, I fail to understand why the
                Northern Ireland Unionist Party cannot support the amendment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The full tradition of constitutional
                politicians should be recognised in this Building. The purpose
                of the amendment is to ensure that we can recognise the many
                Nationalists who contributed to the parliamentary life of
                Stormont. Paddy Devlin was mentioned; Gerry Fitt could be
                mentioned, and Gregory Campbell mentioned others. Some people
                who consider themselves to be neither Unionist nor Nationalist
                made a big contribution to the life of the Parliament. We
                should, for example, consider how to recognise the former
                representatives of the Northern Ireland Labour Party. Perhaps we
                could have a symbol to recognise the Alliance Party, which has
                existed for 30 years. Given recent events, perhaps we could have
                a portrait of its last leader. It seems, however, that the
                Alliance Party has moved ahead of the game, having left the
                Chamber when we began to debate the motion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should reflect the history of this
                Building in a way that recognises the state that we are in,
                because despite the best efforts of some Members opposite, we
                are still part of the United Kingdom. We should do that in a way
                that seeks to add, rather than subtract, and in a way that
                respects constitutional politicians rather than terrorist
                gangsters. I urge Members to support the amendment.</p>

                I am not surprised but a little disappointed by the Ulster
                Unionist response. The motion was an attempt to address the
                Assembly Commission, the body responsible for the matter. The
                contributions by some Members on the other Benches reflect
                poorly on their parties’ representatives on the Assembly
                Commission. First, their representatives could not be trusted to
                debate the matter and provide the Unionist perspective, and
                secondly, they thought that it was a task too far for the
                Assembly Commission to complete this review within two months. I
                have confidence in my party Colleague in the Assembly Commission
                and believe that it could deal adequately with the matter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion did not prescribe anything. It
                simply recognised that the Building and the estate are adorned
                with many symbols of Unionist and British political life, while
                there is limited, if not non-existent, recognition of the rest
                of the community in the North. The motion was an attempt to have
                the Assembly Commission, which is responsible for the Building
                and the estate, consider the matter, to study what the agreement
                suggested should be done about it, and to implement a structured
                approach to deal with it. Peter Weir and Gregory Campbell said
                that the matter had been raised consistently with the Speaker
                since the agreement was signed four years ago.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I acknowledged in my initial presentation,
                the Speaker has moved to deal with some of these issues. He has
                made some efforts, but they have mainly done on an ad-hoc basis.
                We are suggesting that the Assembly Commission, as the corporate
                body responsible for the Building and the estate, look seriously
                at this issue. The attitude of people such as Dr Birnie
                surprises me, as this would be done in a manner consistent with
                the Good Friday Agreement, which his party supports.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will now deal with some of the issues
                raised. Some were very wide of what the debate was about, but
                you expect that. Mr Roche went into details of people who were
                killed, but for every time the anti-agreement Unionists raise
                details of some unfortunate, innocent individual who was killed,
                people on this side of the House could raise similar graphic
                details about people murdered by the UDR, the RUC and the
                British Army. There are victims and pain on both sides.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Campbell said in his contribution that the
                symbols reflected the founding of the State, and compared that
                unfavourably with the founding of the State in the South, and
                Leinster House. If he took the time to go to Leinster House he
                would see two portraits inside the main entrance — one on
                either side of the hall. One is of Cathal Brugha and the other
                is of Michael Collins. Cathal Brugha violently opposed the
                setting up of the State in the South, and was killed violently
                opposing it. Michael Collins was also killed in the setting up
                of the State in the South. Therefore, that is an example and a
                precedent of where different political traditions <i>—[Interruption].</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Member for giving way. That
                approach to history is very revisionist. The Member has named
                two individuals who took different interpretations of what the
                correct Republican response to the 1921 Treaty was. Neither was
                defending the inclusion of the Twenty-six Counties within the
                British Empire after 1921.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr C Murphy:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I said that Mr Campbell referred to the fact
                that the symbols here reflect the setting up of the State, and
                compared that unfavourably with Leinster House. I am saying that
                in Leinster House there is a portrait of a person who opposed
                the setting up of that State opposite a portrait of someone who
                was instrumental in the setting up of that State.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am aware that a statue of Queen Victoria
                was dug up in University College, Cork and replaced there — so
                efforts have been made. Both Mr Campbell and Mr Weir talked
                about reflecting the fact that some Nationalists attended
                Stormont during the 50 years of its existence and misrule. Yet,
                if you look around the Building, there is not a single testimony
                to their attendance, position, political ideology, and their
                desire to see unity in this island reflected here.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Birnie spoke about the intent of the
                motion, and I repeat that the intent is to have this matter
                dealt with by the responsible Committee of the House in a way
                that is consistent with the Good Friday Agreement, which Dr
                Birnie supports. It is not about toppling statues, as happened
                in Eastern Europe — though having seen some of those statues,
                I imagine that perhaps the office of good taste had a
                responsibility for toppling them. I will correct one point that
                he made about the flags issue being dealt with by the Flags
                (Northern Ireland) Order 2000. That Order does not apply to
                Parliament Buildings; the control of the flying of flags on
                Parliament Buildings is a matter for the Assembly Commission.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Roche anticipated some proposals that he
                thought I might make. He realised that I had not made them but
                was not in a position to change his speech, and went on with the
                normal rant against the Good Friday Agreement. I repeat that I
                did not proscribe or prescribe the display here of any symbols;
                I simply asked that a Committee take responsibility for the
                issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCartney made a similar contribution, and
                it was interesting that he referred to democrats such as Carson
                and Craig. It is unfortunate that the Unionists who took over
                the Ulster Unionist Party after him did not adhere to the words
                he quoted from Carson — perhaps we would not be in the mess
                that we have been in for recent years. It was interesting to
                hear him talk about them, because both Carson and Craig were
                quite willing to resort to violence when democracy did not suit
                them. When he was talking about Craig it struck me that John
                Kelly, whom they accuse of gunrunning, should be quite at home
                with the statue of Craigavon on the Stairs, because he was also
                a gunrunner. So these are the parliamentarians — <i>[Interruption]</i>.</p>

                in challenging their own Government of the day. They resorted to

                few murders at the time of the inception of this state.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sam Foster said that people should be honest.
                I shall be honest with him: we oppose the existence of this
                state. Therefore we oppose the imposition of the Union flag. I,
                as an Irish Republican, am being honest. We have always
                demonstrated clearly our intention and our desire to see the end
                of this state and the creation of a new Ireland. There is no
                surprise in that. Mr Foster was perhaps trying to provoke us by
                talking about our Ministers as &quot;Ministers of the
                state&quot; and &quot;seeking Royal Assent&quot;, but he merely
                proved how much Sinn Féin has moved to accommodate Unionists in
                implementing the Good Friday Agreement and by taking those
                steps.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He made an interesting comment that we all
                should note: he said that David Trimble was a Unionist Prime
                Minister and that Mark Durkan was a deputy Minister. David
                Trimble must have held that job description privately because
                that is how he has acted since he was elected, rather than
                follow his official job description, which is to act jointly
                with Mark Durkan as First Minister and Deputy First Minister for
                all the people of this region.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with some of the points made by Alex
                Attwood on the amendment. Unionists are happy to commemorate one
                or two individuals who may have participated in Stormont over
                the years, but there is absolutely no reflection of their
                political ideology, their identity or the experience of the
                Nationalist people as a whole.</p>

                Éireann and said that his party does not care what happens
                there. The Democratic Unionist Party constantly cites the
                experience of Southern Protestants as being of huge interest,
                yet it has no interest in how the institutions of the Southern
                state reflect the totality of life there.</p>

                saying that when Eastern bloc countries use the title
                &quot;democratic&quot;, one knows that they are the very
                antithesis of democracy. Nevertheless, he moved from a party
                that does not have that word in its title to one that has. The
                point is well made that those who must state to the world that

                territory. All the money was poured into all the symbols that
                reflect the British and Unionist ethos.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He raised the issue of the four-year
                timescale. That has been raised consistently with the Speaker.
                It is on record as being raised in the Chamber, and it is
                certainly on record as being raised at meetings of the Assembly
                Commission. The timescale for the Commission to report back is
                achievable. It may be a reflection on Jim Wells or Bob Coulter
                or on the Members who think that that is not enough time for the
                Commission to get their heads around a piece of business.
                Members on this side of the Chamber who sit on the Assembly
                Commission feel that it is well within their capabilities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issue is one of embracing a genuinely new
                beginning to politics on this island. The Building and the
                estate, for better or worse, embody the hopes of the vast
                majority of the people of this community in the North for a
                shared future, free from the conflict of the past. Everyone has
                a stake in that future and their identity — Unionist,
                Nationalist, Republican or other — should be welcomed and
                reflected in our institutions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proposal identifies a way that we can
                discuss and agree that shared future together, through the
                responsible body in the Assembly. It should be supported, and we
                should look forward to the Assembly Commission bringing a report
                to the Chamber in the autumn that we can all debate.</p>
