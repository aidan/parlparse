		    <p class="H4StageHeading">Public Authorities (Reform) Bill</p>
		    <p class="H4StageHeading">Extension of Committee Stage</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister  (Mr Kennedy):</strong> I beg to move</p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion">That, in accordance with Standing Order 33(4), the period  referred to in Standing Order 33(2) be extended to 12 December 2008, in relation  to the Committee Stage of the Public Authorities (Reform) Bill (NIA Bill  19/07).</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Public Authorities (Reform) Bill passed its Second  Stage on 30 June and was referred to the Committee for the Office of the First  Minister and deputy First Minister on the same day. The Bill seeks to transfer  the functions of the Fisheries Conservancy Board to the Department of Culture,  Arts and Leisure and to abolish the Disability Living Allowance Advisory Board  for Northern Ireland.  The Bill also contains a number of repeals of primary legislation relating to  organisations that have been abolished, including Enterprise  Ulster,  the Pig Production Development Committee and Laganside Corporation.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill forms part of the legislative programme to  implement the review of public administration. The Committee for the Office of  the First Minister and deputy First Minister has considered the Bill on a  number of occasions and has agreed to write to the Department requesting an  amendment to the Bill. The Committee seeks an extension until 12 December 2008  to allow the Department time to consider the Committee&rsquo;s proposed amendment. I  ask Members for their support.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion">That, in accordance with Standing Order 33(4), the period  referred to in Standing Order 33(2) be extended to 12 December 2008, in  relation to the Committee Stage of the Public Authorities (Reform) Bill (NIA  Bill 19/07).</p>

		    <p class="H4StageHeading">Report from the Committee for Social Development on the  <br>
	        Administration of Disability Living Allowance</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Due to the unavoidable absence of both the Chairperson and Deputy  Chairperson of the Social Development Committee, the Committee has agreed that  Miss Michelle McIlveen will move the motion on its behalf. The Speaker is  content that the Committee has reached an agreement about the revised  arrangement, and the motion may proceed.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to two hours  for the debate. The proposer of the motion will have 10 minutes in which to  propose and 10 minutes to make a winding-up speech, and all other Members who  are called to speak will have five minutes.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Miss McIlveen</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly approves the Report of the Committee for  Social Development on the Administration of Disability Living Allowance and  calls on the Department for Social Development to implement the  recommendations.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Speaker for permitting me to propose the motion  on behalf of the Chairperson of the Committee for Social Development.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Disability affects the lives of a large number of people in  Northern Ireland.  The Northern Ireland  survey of people with activity limitations and disabilities from July 2007  found that people in around 18% of households face limitations in their daily  living as a consequence of a disability or a long-term condition. Disability  living allowance (DLA) is a tax-free, non-means-tested social-security benefit  for people under the age of 65 who have an illness or disability and who need  help getting around or help with personal care.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">DLA was introduced in 1992, in recognition of the fact that  existing benefits did not meet the needs of some groups of disabled people.  Today, around 170,000 people in Northern    Ireland &mdash; roughly 10% of the population &mdash;  receive either the mobility or care component, or both components, of the  disability living allowance. The two separate components of DLA &mdash; mobility and  care &mdash; can be assessed on several different levels and can be combined to give  12 possible outcomes. Members will agree that that makes for a complicated  system for both claimants and the Department, and the complexity increases  further when the self-assessment element of DLA is added.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Faced with limited information on the administration of  DLA, the Committee for Social Development produced the report to initiate  discussion, highlight concerns and make recommendations for improvement.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The report on the administration of DLA is centred on  different areas. I shall deal with information collection first. While  reviewing the administration of DLA, the Committee found that the Department  could not provide information on the numbers and types of disallowed or  unsuccessful applications. The UK Department for Work and Pensions (DWP)  maintains the Department&rsquo;s information system. Apparently, that system cannot  be reconfigured for Northern    Ireland, and a local database is not  maintained. The Appeals Service (Northern Ireland) (TAS(NI))  introduced a computer system that captures such information on 1 July 2007, and  the Committee could obtain only information on DLA appeals from that date.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee believes that accurate data on all  applications &mdash; successful, unsuccessful, appealed or otherwise &mdash; are essential  for the appropriate management of DLA. Therefore, the Committee recommends that  the Department develop a cost-effective information system to collect data on  disallowances and unsuccessful applicants who enter the appeals process.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Members should consider the application process. DLA  claimants are faced with a lengthy 48-page application form. Although work has  been undertaken to improve the form, the Committee believes that that aspect of  the application process can be an unnecessary barrier for vulnerable claimants  or those with limited literacy and numeracy skills. The Committee recommends  that the application form undergo a further revision, given the importance of  the forms and the requirement for some claims to be renewed regularly.  Widespread consultation should take place with key stakeholders on a revised  and simplified DLA application form.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I shall now talk about the decision-making process for DLA  applicants. Decision-makers have a difficult task: they must consider the  information provided and apply complex rules to arrive at their assessment; and  they must work to achieve clearance-time targets. The Committee recommends that  the clearance-time target be redefined for those cases in which more detailed  and time-consuming evidence is required.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As before, the Committee found it difficult to comment at  length on that aspect of the administration of DLA because of the absence of  detailed information. The Committee recommends that the Department invests in a  cost-effective data-collection system for all evidence sought by decision-makers  so as to allow for proper monitoring and analysis.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In respect of the decision-making process, the Committee  has reviewed the role of medical practitioners and recommends that the  Department reviews the complexity and level of completion of the GP reports  used in DLA assessments. The Committee had further concerns about the reports  produced by examining medical practitioners and whether those reports fairly  assessed the impact of a person&rsquo;s disability on his or her mobility or care  needs. The Committee, therefore, recommends that a survey be undertaken of all  DLA claimants who have undergone a medical examination. Such a survey would  establish the level of satisfaction and would inform improvement of that aspect  of the service.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore &mdash; and, again, with a view to informing  improvement &mdash; the Committee recommends that the Department considers the  appointment of senior officials with adjudication experience to monitor the  accuracy of all DLA decision-making. The Committee was also concerned with apparent  anomalies in respect of different periods of awards made to claimants  suffering, ostensibly, from the same disabilities. The Committee recommends  that the Department reviews those inconsistencies.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee also considered the DLA dispute procedure. A  surprisingly large number of applications result in referral to the DLA dispute  procedure. The Committee believes that, in some cases, the process can be  unnecessarily lengthy. It is recommended that the Department amends procedures  to allow reconsidered appeals to be processed in the same time frame as the  first appeal. In order to reduce the number of appeals, it is recommended that  the Department increases the emphasis on evidence-gathering at the initial  stages of claims. Evidence should come from a wider variety of sources, and  better use should be made of medical records. It is hoped that that will reduce  the number of appeals resolved as a result of the later acceptance of  additional evidence.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">To further reduce the number of appeals, it is recommended  that the Department revises its procedures and requires presenting officers to  attend all appeal tribunal hearings. That will ensure that lessons are learnt  and fed back. It is hoped that constructive feedback from presenting officers  will lead to fewer appeals, less cost for the Department and, ultimately, less  anxiety for claimants. To improve confidence and transparency in the appeals  process, it is also recommended that the president of The Appeals Service (Northern Ireland)  should have sufficient information to allow him oversight of the entire DLA  appeals process, including timely information on appeals made.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As I said earlier, DLA is an important benefit for many  people in Northern Ireland,  and the Committee recognises the difficulties that the Department faces in  administering the benefit. It is the Committee&rsquo;s hope that the report&rsquo;s  recommendations will be helpful to the Department and will assist in the  improvement of the administration of DLA in Northern Ireland. On behalf of the  Committee for Social Development, I commend the report to the Assembly. I look  forward to hearing the views of Members and the Minister on the Committee&rsquo;s  recommendations.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. As Members are aware, most of the  legislation that comes before the Committee for Social Development is parity  legislation. If the Committee cannot change the legislation, it can certainly  consider the effectiveness of its administration, and that forms the thrust of  the report.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As has been stated, DLA is a benefit that was introduced in  1992, and it gives people with disabilities the opportunity to fill out a  self-assessment questionnaire when completing the claim forms. In the  beginning, that approach worked reasonably well, but as the benefit evolved,  the Department&rsquo;s administration of the benefit became more inconsistent and  more difficult for claimants to understand.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am aware of a case that clearly highlights the  inconsistency of the Department&rsquo;s adjudication procedures. DLA was applied for  in respect of two children with Down&rsquo;s syndrome &mdash; one child was awarded the  benefit for two years, and the other was awarded it indefinitely. However,  those children have the same condition &mdash; one that they have to live with for  their entire lives.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The claim form, which has 48 pages and repeats questions,  is challenging. The Committee suggests that the maintenance of parity would not  be compromised if a different claim form were used. The form could be  simplified and yet obtain the same information. It should have a specific  mental-health section to enable claimants to explain their problems in detail.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The interpretation of medical evidence must be greatly  improved. Favourable GP reports about a patient&rsquo;s suitability for DLA are often  ignored, but the Department quotes less informative reports ad nauseam. People  here deserve a better service. The Department must take account of the  decisions of the Office of the Social Security and Child Support Commissioners  in DLA cases. Commissioners decided that the effect that a condition has on a  claimant needs to be considered, rather than the cause.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee has made 13 recommendations, one of which is  a redefinition of clearance-time targets for cases that require particular  types of evidence or further evidence. That would ensure that decisions are  both timely and correct. Another recommendation is for the Department to  examine whether claimants with similar circumstances are awarded DLA for the  same length of time. The Committee recommends that the Department appoint a  senior official with adjudication expertise to oversee all departmental  decision-making.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee recommends that presenting officers should be  present at every appeal tribunal hearing. Indeed, Mr Maclynn, president of the  Appeals Service, subpoenaed the Department in an effort to ensure the  attendance of presenting officers. He felt that that would give better  definition to the appeals process, but his plan was never implemented. In the  area that I represent, the appeals tribunal centre in Newry probably deals with  more appeals than any area outside Belfast.  However, the Department is represented at about only 36% of those appeals  tribunals.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee also recommends that the Department supply  the president of the Appeals Service with all relevant information to grant him  independent oversight of the entire appeals process. In particular, the  president should be supplied with timely information on appeals. Approximately  170,000 people here are in receipt of DLA. Contrary to the bad publicity and  innuendo, the Department&rsquo;s figures show that it has the lowest level of fraud.  Indeed, fewer than 0&middot;01% of DLA claims are fraudulent.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The report is detailed and comprehensive, and the Committee  should be praised for its compilation. The Committee&rsquo;s recommendations can only  help to alleviate the problems faced by people applying for DLA, and those  already in receipt of the benefit. I ask the Assembly to approve the report. Go  raibh m&iacute;le maith agat.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I welcome the Committee for Social Development&rsquo;s report. It is a fine piece of  work, which I hope the Department and the Minister will welcome as a useful  contribution to the administration of disability living allowance in Northern Ireland.  The report is well written and thorough, and it contains a number of helpful  recommendations.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that some, if not all, of those recommendations can  be put to good use by the Department. Disability living allowance is an  important aspect of the social-security system in Northern Ireland. It affects  170,000 people &mdash; a sizeable part of the population of Northern Ireland  &mdash; in some way or another.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee&rsquo;s report includes the basic observation that  the form is very long, repetitive and unnecessarily complex. The Department  should consider that observation carefully. The Committee is wedded to the  concept of parity with regard to benefits, not with regard to the  administration of the system. I hope that the Department takes on board the  idea of reconfiguring the application form and some of its questions so that it  meets the local circumstances of people in Northern Ireland. We must be  cognisant of, and sensitive to, the reality that some applicants for benefit do  not have high literacy skills. It is important to show compassion and an  understanding of the difficulties that those people face.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As Michelle McIlveen &mdash; who spoke on behalf of the Committee  Chairperson &mdash; and other Members said, it is important to consider the quality  of evidence that is provided to the Department for its decision-making when  processing DLA. Poor-quality evidence will result in poor decision-making. It  is as simple as that. The quality of the evidence must be improved, and it must  be ensured that the medical evidence that is given is sufficient to meet the  needs of the applicant as well as the Department&rsquo;s needs in assessing the  applicant&rsquo;s circumstances. It is important that the Department takes that on  board also.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to raise the issue of what I call the data gap.  There is a serious data failure in relation to DLA, and that must be improved.  Data must be collected in order to understand more fully how the system works.  That will allow a better system to be put into operation.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that all those points are taken on board.  There are anomalies in awards, and that must be addressed. The Department must  revisit many aspects of the system. The report is helpful, and I hope that the  Department takes it on board.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: I  thank the Committee, departmental staff and those who submitted oral and  written evidence during the compilation of the report. The report provides a  good insight into the challenges of the administration of disability living  allowance. Many people &mdash; almost one in 10 in Northern Ireland &mdash; receive DLA. In  2007-08, on average, 2,000 fresh DLA claims were made each month. On top of  that, almost 1,400 renewal applications, 1,000 supersession requests, 800  reconsideration requests and 600 appeal requests were made each month.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">By all accounts, that is a large volume of work, which also  involves a complicated assessment process that relies on judgment and  interpretation of detailed medical evidence, and includes, at times, medical  reports or examinations. All in all, (SSA) staff do their job effectively, but  efforts must be made to achieve excellence and continuous improvement.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee&rsquo;s report provides some learning points for  the Department. I support all the recommendations; in particular, those  relating to data collection, the self-assessment claim form, gathering evidence  at the initial claim stage, and the need for presenting officers to be at all  appeal tribunals.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The report criticises the lack of data available to the  Committee about unsuccessful applicants and about further evidence collected  during the decision-making process. Clearly, the Department must have that  information to evaluate and benchmark standards in SSA practices.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The self-assessment form is the size of a book and is not  straightforward &mdash; it is particularly difficult for people with literacy or  mental-health problems. Also, one can imagine how difficult it can be for  people whose first language is not English to plough through all those pages.  The Department recently promoted a great strategy aimed at encouraging  hard-to-reach groups to claim their rightful benefit entitlements. Therefore,  obstacles, such as complicated forms, must not be put in the way of those who  are already vulnerable.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Many new claimants also seek help from advice centres in  their own communities. Sadly, the voluntary sector faces a serious funding  crisis caused by the loss of peace funding, diminishing support from lottery  funding, shrinking neighbourhood-renewal support and by the impact of the  comprehensive spending review. Many advice-worker posts have gone in those  communities, creating problems for people who want help in completing the  forms.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Figures in the Committee&rsquo;s report reveal that over the past  few years, half of the appeals tribunal decisions went in favour of the  appellants. It is right that the report recommends better evidence gathering at  the decision-making stage. It will ensure that more comprehensive assessments  are made, wrong decisions are avoided, and delays, appeals and unnecessary  costs are minimised.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Northern Ireland Audit Office report, &lsquo;Decision-Making  and Disability Living Allowance&rsquo;, acknowledged that the SSA intended that  presenting officers attend 100% of appeals hearings. However, the Committee&rsquo;s  report showed that in Belfast  in 2006 and 2007, for example, the attendance rate of presenting officers was  less than 30%. That is not good enough.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member must bring her remarks to a close.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: The  benefit of presenting officers attending appeals is clearly stated in the  Committee&rsquo;s report, which I urge the Department to consider carefully.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Armstrong</strong>:  The report&rsquo;s key point can be found in one sentence in the executive summary:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;It is vital that those who are entitled to Disability  Living Allowance get the correct award, for the correct period, without any  undue delay.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">If that is adhered to, the rest is straightforward.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">12.30 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As has been stated, the report&rsquo;s terms of reference mean  that it is solely concerned with the administration of DLA and not with policy  issues surrounding uptake and fraud, among other things. There are many genuine  concerns about those matters, but they must wait for another day.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Disability living allowance affects some of the most  vulnerable people in our society, and it is vital that we strike a balance  between creating a system whereby claimants who are entitled to DLA actually  receive their entitlements and ensuring that those who are not entitled to  receive benefits are prevented from doing so.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Like other MLAs, I have been contacted by many constituents  who have been bewildered by the complexities involved in completing the  relevant forms. Therefore, I fully support the Committee&rsquo;s recommendations, as  they are designed to improve the administrative process and to ensure that it  is made less confusing for claimants. That should help to alleviate the current  situation whereby &pound;190 million in DLA is underpaid in the United Kingdom.  That is money to which people are entitled, and it should make a real  difference to the lives of vulnerable people and their families.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am mindful of the fact that Northern   Ireland has a higher ratio of people claiming DLA than  the rest of the United    Kingdom. There may be sound reasons for  that, but the Department has a duty to investigate the matter and to find out  why that is the case and what can be done about it.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In October 2007, it was announced that the number of people  claiming DLA in Northern    Ireland was increasing by 1,000 per month,  and it had reached a record high of 174,343 claimants, which amounts to more  than 10% of the population. The most common reasons for claiming were  arthritis, which accounted for more than 30,000 claims, and heart disease,  which accounted for more than 11,000 claims.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There are very real public-health implications and  challenges arising from such figures, and those must be recognised by the  Health Minister&rsquo;s commitment to the public-health agenda. If we work together  and, in many cases, that means people taking personal responsibility for their  health and well-being by stopping smoking and by eating and drinking sensibly,  we should be able to improve the nation&rsquo;s health, have a better quality of life  and reduce the number of people who require DLA. That will benefit people&rsquo;s  health, and it will also benefit taxpayers.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>: I  commend the report from the Committee for Social Development on the  administration of disability living allowance.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The allowance was introduced in 1992 to incorporate both  attendance and mobility allowances, in recognition that the needs of some  groups were not being met. Famously &mdash; or, indeed, infamously &mdash; it also  introduced the self-assessment form to allow more detailed individual  description of claimants&rsquo; disabilities. The intention was to ensure that  individuals with disabilities receive the help that they deserve. However, 16  years later, disability living allowance is causing consternation not only to  our constituents but to Members who, in many instances, support individuals who  have been let down by the system.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">When one considers the administration of the allowance,  some startling &mdash; if not obvious &mdash; issues come to light. First, no data was  being collected on the numbers of unsuccessful claimants who entered the  appeals process, so we are all left wondering about the accuracy of the system.  If one was a sceptic, one could almost jump to the conclusion that that had  been done deliberately. Secondly, the claim form is 48-pages long, and it  repeatedly requests the same information. It is a form that would tax a  university professor, never mind the most vulnerable in our society who are  meant to fill it out. Again, if one was being sceptical, one would wonder why  the form is so complex.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">During the decision-making process, civil servants must  apply complex rules and laws to the whole application form. That forces them  into further consultation with the applicants, their GPs and other agencies &mdash;  even the agency&rsquo;s medical practitioners. The process goes on and on. When one  considers the application form and the consultation that has to take place, it  is surprising that anyone actually arrives at a decision.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, taking into account the complexity of the  decision-making process, it is not hard to see how civil servants come under  huge pressure to meet target times, and how, perhaps, they do not find the  right time balance when it comes to the necessary consultation with the  experts.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">All of those factors lead to a high level of  dissatisfaction, which, unfortunately, is not being monitored but needs to be  monitored in order to reflect how good or bad the administration of the system  really is. There are also major issues around the time taken to reassess  disability cases. It is significant that we are approaching the end of the  three-year disability and carers&rsquo; strategy. The Department must examine the  issue closely, because no one in the Committee wants to go back to the random  selection process that was in place previously.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Another issue that stands out is the plight of applicants  who are turned down and who, sometimes, have to go through a lengthy review of  their cases. If they enter into an appeals process, they suddenly find  themselves at the back of an ever-lengthening queue. Everyone agrees that that  is unacceptable, and that it must be examined. A system that keeps applicants  in the existing queue must be developed, because people who apply for DLA are at  their most vulnerable when they enter the process. They are under extreme  stress, not only with regard to their health, but with regard to their ability  to pay. That must be readdressed.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Given the failings that I have outlined, I support the Committee&rsquo;s  report and I hope that its recommendations will be implemented.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I am glad of the opportunity to  speak at the launch of the report today. It is crucial that the Assembly is  seen to be acting in support of the report&rsquo;s recommendations. It is even more  important that the Minister for Social Development takes on board, and acts on,  the need for change in the administration of disability living allowance.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am sure that the Minister will appreciate that the 13  recommendations contained in the report will make it easier for people to  access a benefit, which, for many, can offer the necessary lifeline to deal  with the problems that they face in everyday life.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Disability living allowance was introduced in 1992 to  replace attendance allowance and mobility allowance, which, it was felt, did  not meet the needs of disabled people with learning disability or visual  impairment.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The self-assessment claim form for DLA was supposed to make  it easier for people to apply for the benefit and simplify its administration.  It is now accepted by many in the advice and medical fields that the form is  complicated, and that it poses great difficulties for people with literacy  difficulties or mental-health problems. People have told me that they believe  that the form is a minefield, and that it is deliberately designed to put them  off applying for DLA.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The administration process has also been a nightmare for  people because of its lengthy delays and contradictory decisions. I was presented  with an example of that nightmare recently. Two families from the same area,  and in almost exactly similar circumstances, applied for DLA but received  different awards. That left them feeling confused and angry, as no explanation  was given for the disparity.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">DLA is meant to assist people who are not in a position to  help themselves, and provide financial respite for carers that can make their  lives, and those of their loved ones, a little bit easier. We must ensure that  that happens, and not the opposite. In many ways, the origins of the report lie  in the evidence-based sessions that were held by the Committee for Social  Development in the Long Gallery. During one session, Committee members met  several sets of parents who told harrowing stories of their interaction with  the system of administration of DLA.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I commend all those carers who daily provide the loving  attention that their loved ones require. No amount of resources can replace the  love and commitment that is needed to provide the help that is demanded in such  circumstances. I also commend the officers and members of the Committee for  Social Development for their determination to publish the report. I know that  it has been difficult for them to piece together the different parts of the  jigsaw that constitute the report. I particularly commend my colleague Mickey  Brady, whose lifetime knowledge and experience in the advice sector allowed him  to ask the crucial questions at a key point in the inquiry.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">A LeasCheann Comhairle, a broad wealth of experience is  available to the Minister and the Department, of which they should avail  themselves when considering the recommendations. The ethos of disability living  allowance is to allow people to cope with the problems that they face from a  debilitating illness or to receive the care and attention that is required to  live some kind of normal life. It is incumbent on all Members to ensure that  the report does not sit gathering dust. We must ensure that the recommendations  are not only taken on board but implemented. The Assembly must ensure that  people have confidence in the benefits system; that can be done only when there  is transparency and clarity.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>:  I have followed the debate with interest, and, like most Members, I agree with  the thrust of the report and the principle behind it &mdash; to ensure that the right  benefit goes to the right person at the right time. It is important that that  principle is maintained when it comes to the expenditure of public resources.  However, it is also important to identify &mdash; as the Committee for Social  Development has quite rightly done &mdash; the problems that Members, and, indeed,  the public, have encountered in the administration of disability living  allowance. Those problems stem from differing interpretations of the same  policy. To get those interpretations right seems to be a minefield. I hope that  the Department can give straightforward advice to departmental officials to  ensure that the same interpretation is always given so that the confusion that  has been identified by many Members is completely eradicated.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I agree with what Members have said about the form-filling  process. If people arrive at my constituency office with an application form  for disability living allowance, they have to make a separate appointment and  at least an hour and a half is set aside in order to assist them with filling  out that application. That demonstrates the incredible complexity of the  questions asked on the application form and the entire procedure.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I will focus on three of the report&rsquo;s recommendations.  Recommendation 8 identifies the issue of misinterpretation of policy. Most  Members will have personal experiences of cases when a GP has given them  specific evidence and an independent medical adviser has given completely  different evidence, yet the finding is the same, in that the applicant usually  does not obtain the benefit in question. In most cases, the balance appears to  be that the Department agrees with the findings of the independent medical  practitioner rather than those of the local GP. However, I believe that a local  GP understands a claimant considerably better than an independent practitioner  who examines that claimant for a few moments and then makes an assessment of  his or her ability to work. That matter must be considered urgently.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In my experience, the fact that a person goes through the  arduous process of making an application, with all the trauma that that  involves, and then takes the further step of going through a tribunal process  if his or her initial claim is turned down, indicates that that person is  genuine and wants to follow the correct process to claim an entitlement. Such  people are made to feel that they are being called liars because of statements  that they have made on their application form, which is harrowing and must be  addressed.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Recommendation 6 states that the Department should carry  out:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;a survey of all Disability Living Allowance claimants  who have undergone a medical assessment, to seek their views and establish a  level of satisfaction.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">A medical practitioner simply conducting a further  assessment or survey of what the applicant feels has happened is not the way  forward.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">12.45 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that an independent medical practitioner  surveys that work, because applicants are usually not aware how important it is  to provide the practitioner with all the facts and evidence regarding their  claims. On many occasions, a medical practitioner will call with an applicant  for a quick meeting, without the applicant realising how critical that first  assessment is to their overall hearing. Applicants must be made aware of the  critical importance of that first meeting. If that meeting goes wrong,  claimants face an uphill struggle in trying to obtain a benefit to which, in  many instances, they are fully entitled. Further work must be done to address  that, and some serious training must be provided.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In recommendation 12, the Committee recommends that  presenting officers be present at every appeal tribunal hearing. The stats  appear to show that presenting officers are present for about only one third of  all cases. Presenting officers should attend tribunals to make the case as to  why a person is not receiving benefit. However, there will be huge costs and,  ultimately a delay to appellants&rsquo; claims, if we are to wait for a presenting  officer to attend every time. That issue must be examined quickly.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cobain</strong>:  Like other Members, I thank the Committee for its report. I also join with  other Members to call on the Minister to implement the report&rsquo;s recommendations  as quickly as possible.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">People who qualify for disability living allowance have  severe physical and mental disabilities. It is of paramount importance that we  have an excellent administration and adjudication process in place to ensure  that those people receive their claims in the most efficient and effective way  possible.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Unfortunately, many claimants do not get their correct  benefit entitlements immediately. It should also be recognised that 50% of  people who receive disability living allowance are, in fact, in employment. In Northern Ireland,  false disability living allowance claims are a reality. We must put in place a  system that ensures that those people who need help receive it efficiently and  those people who are not entitled to benefits are removed from the system.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The administration of application and adjudication  processes is vital in attempting to deliver a fair system for all. As Mr  Paisley Jnr said, the process of applying for disability living allowance is  long, complex and comes in several parts. It can take a considerable time to  complete the forms and to provide the correct information. People practically  need a degree to complete the applications for disability living allowance. It  is vitally important that people provide the most relevant and useful  information in support of their claim, and that that is handled in the most  efficient and appropriate way.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Members are aware that disability living allowance can be a  claimant&rsquo;s passport to receiving other benefits and, on occasion, to increasing  the amounts of pension credits, housing benefits and rate relief already  received. Therefore, it is important that claims be handled and utilised  properly.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In today&rsquo;s financial climate of rising energy prices and increasing  consumer costs, it is crucial that we help those people who are most vulnerable  in society to obtain the benefits to which they are entitled. Additionally, it  is crucial that that money not be misappropriated. The Committee discovered  that in any modern Government Department, or even any business, adequate  monitoring and analysis of inputs and data collected must be improved in order  to inform any future strategic decision-making process. That is a crucial first  step in improving the service. Unfortunately, the Committee was impeded in its  consideration of the accuracy of the decision-making on claims, because there  was a considerable lack of relevant and reliable data on the administration  process.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Receiving disability living allowance can have an extremely  beneficial impact on people&rsquo;s lives. On many occasions, the Minister for Social  Development has said that it is important that people claim all the benefits to  which they are entitled as a passport out of poverty.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Additionally, benefits should not go to those who do not  qualify for them, because that costs everyone in society &mdash; people must  understand that. Therefore, the Committee has recommended that the Department  implements a robust, efficient and effective system to collect data on  unsuccessful applicants and disallowances in the disputes process. It is also  critically important that the information that the Department receives allows  it to assess not only claimants&rsquo; medical diagnoses, but the effect that they  have on the level of care that they require, their mobility and their ability  to engage with the world around them.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The self-assessment claim form was intended to allow  claimants to describe, in their own words, how their disability affects their  daily lives. However, the Committee was concerned that, because the form is so  complex and repetitive, it is almost impossible for some claimants &mdash; and some  MLAs &mdash; to complete, which could deter them from claiming altogether. We must  address that issue as quickly as possible.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee acknowledges the concerns that GPs expressed  about their ability to give information on the functional needs of patients and  describe the effect of patients&rsquo; symptoms on their care and mobility, which is  a key issue for disability living allowance. The Committee recommends that the  Department consider the issue of GP reports, including standards of completion,  relevance of questions, the amount of reliance placed on those reports by  decision-makers, and the fee paid for completion.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee was not wholly convinced that there was  consistency in the way in which claimants with similar needs are treated with  respect to periods of awards. It was also concerned that the Northern Ireland Standards  Committee has limited adjudication expertise.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I join other Members in paying  tribute to the work of the Committee staff, particularly the Committee Clerk,  in their preparation of the report. As Fra McCann said, the Committee also  benefited from the experience that Mickey Brady brought from his previous  employment.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Anna Lo mentioned the statistic that two in five households  across the North contain one person with limited mobility or a disability. We must  examine the causes of ill health and lack of mobility, which include poverty  and the impact of the conflict. Although it is widely accepted that poverty and  ill health are interlinked, not all people who receive DLA are poor or  deprived.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As Members have said, the first purpose of the report is to  open discussions, which must be welcomed. As all Members will know from their  constituencies, the application process for DLA has been a harrowing experience  for many people. As Jonathan Craig outlined, if a claimant has an application  turned down and goes through an appeals process, he or she must go to the end  of another queue. By and large, those claimants are in pain and are under  pressure physically and financially. That is one of the most unfair ways to deal  with the most vulnerable people in our communities.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The decision-making process requires attention. The  computer system that Members mentioned does not hold data on those who were not  successful in their applications. Therefore, the Department does not have a  true picture or analysis of those who were refused DLA. That problem is cited  in the recommendations and must be considered.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There are 13 recommendations, which are clear &mdash; there are  no recommendations in the report to which anyone would take exception. The  report is an opportunity for the Committee and the Department to devise  measures that benefit people in need. I look forward to hearing the Minister&rsquo;s  comments on that. The problems in the administration of DLA can be addressed  quickly, and the benefits could be instant if all the recommendations in the  report, and more, were adopted.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In my previous role as health spokesperson for Sinn F&eacute;in, a  common complaint that I heard from GPs was the role of their reports in the  decision-making process on DLA applications. As Mickey Brady pointed out, the  more detail that is provided on a patient&rsquo;s condition, the less likely it is  that their claim will be successful.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">One imagines that the reverse would be the case. GPs feel  frustrated, because they can explain in clinical and sometimes detailed terms  what a person is going through; however, there is little room to describe how  someone&rsquo;s mobility is affected, which is a key factor in making a decision on  mobility and care.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In my constituency, one aspect that disturbed me was the  role of some of the medical examiners and practitioners who visit people in  their homes. Ian Paisley Jnr is 100% right in what he said. People,  particularly older people, open the door, offer tea and make a fuss of their  visitors. That is like old people years ago who cleaned the house because the  home help was coming. It is their cultural background, and they do not realise  that being able to go and put on the kettle may limit them from receiving a  benefit to which they are entitled.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">More than that &mdash; and, possibly, worse &mdash; people with chronic  depression, whose mobility is severely disrupted, and who, genuinely, should be  in receipt of the benefit, were told to give themselves a shake. If a medical  examiner does not have the wherewithal, compassion or empathy to understand a  condition that may qualify for award, that is disturbing. Given the high level  of mental-health illnesses, for all sorts of reasons, I urge that the report  and recommendations be accepted, and ask Members for their support. Go raibh  m&iacute;le maith agat.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText"><span class="B1SpeakersNameChar"><span style="font-size:11.0pt; ">The  Minister for Social Development (Ms Ritchie): </span></span>I welcome the work  undertaken by the Chairperson and members of the Committee for Social  Development, and the submission made by Miss McIlveen on the Committee&rsquo;s  behalf. The report manages to be concise and comprehensive in those areas on  which it is focused, and contains a number of detailed recommendations. I  commend the Committee and recognise its hard work in bringing forward the  report.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">At a time when all politicians are being criticised in the  context of the DUP-Sinn F&eacute;in stalemate and logjam in the Executive, it is worth  letting the public know &mdash; and particularly worth reminding the media &mdash; that a  lot of good work goes on in this place. I know, too, how much work the DSD  Committee put into the Charities Bill, and other legislation that I brought  forward to the Committee. The popular jibe about all those politicians up there  on the hill doing nothing, is, therefore, inaccurate and unfair. I gently  suggest to the media that they could do more to challenge such a perception,  rather than feed it.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am sure that all Members, and the Committee, will  appreciate that I have had insufficient time in which to do justice to the  report&rsquo;s recommendations by giving them the careful consideration that they  merit. I do not intend, therefore, to respond in detail to all the specifics in  the report, but I will give it the consideration that it deserves and respond  to the Committee in due course.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Nevertheless, I want to say a few words on the issues that  are raised in the report. Members understand my view on welfare entitlement: I  am determined that every person who is entitled to support under the welfare  system should receive all the support to which they are entitled. That is,  perhaps, particularly so in the case of disability living allowance, where  decisions on entitlement impact on vulnerable people. That is why I welcome the  opportunity to debate the way forward on the administration of disability  living allowance.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I agree that it is vital that those who are responsible for  the administration of the process get things right. Mindful of that, I have set  challenging public service agreement targets for disability living allowance in  respect of financial accuracy and claims clearance times. It is also important  to give credit where credit is due.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Let me quote from the recent Public Accounts Committee&rsquo;s  report &lsquo;Social Security Benefit Fraud and Error&rsquo;:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The benefit system is inherently complex and the  Committee recognises the good work being done by Agency staff in delivering  services to customers, often under difficult and pressurised circumstances.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">It is also worth noting that the level of fraud and  error is down substantially from previous years and compares favourably with  that of other institutions that release money into the public domain.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">1.00 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Public Accounts Committee is absolutely correct in  recognising the complexity of the disability-living-allowance process; a factor  that has been recognised by all Members who spoke in the debate. That  complexity has been recognised by other independent commentators and the  Committee&rsquo;s report acknowledges that very issue. That complexity is, perhaps,  best illustrated when Members consider that there are 13 possible outcome  decisions on every single claim, which is unique in the benefit system.  Decisions can range from awards of both components at the higher rate, which is  around &pound;113&middot;75 each week, to a refusal of benefit. Each outcome carries the  same appeal rights.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The system&rsquo;s complexity is not cause for complacency. It  calls for action. Against that backdrop, my Department has taken significant  steps forward in the administration of disability living allowance with  particular emphasis on delivering improvements in the quality of work.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  The Minister talks about the system&rsquo;s complexity and its resultant anomalies. I  want to bring to her attention the fact that the Royal National Institute of  Blind People calls for partially sighted people to be awarded DLA at the higher  level of mobility. Is the Minister aware of that? What action will her  Department take on the matter?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank Mr Maginness for his intervention. I am well  aware of the lobby campaign by the Royal National Institute of Blind People. In  fact, I will meet the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions in November  2008. I will raise that very issue among other benefits matters and discuss how  they impact &mdash; in some cases, detrimentally &mdash; on the people of Northern Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I will return to the issue about which I was speaking, with  particular reference to the system&rsquo;s complexities and the need to deliver  improvements in the quality of work. The indicator that is used to measure  financial accuracy is now 98&middot;8%. That is an improvement of 5&middot;3% since March  2005. At the same time, it is equally important that people&rsquo;s claims are  processed promptly. There has also been an enormous advance in that area with  claims now being processed within eight weeks, compared with 15 weeks in 2003,  which is a 50% improvement. It is also worth noting that at the outset, the DLA  system experienced difficulty. That was recognised in a report that was produced  by the Public Accounts Committee at Westminster  in 1998. I understand that significant improvements have been made since then.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The disability living allowance team underpins all that  work. It delivers over 60,000 transactions and responds to almost a quarter of  a million phone calls each year. In such a scenario, some things will go wrong.  However, by and large, the team delivers well and gets things right.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>:  I am the first person to acknowledge that the complexity of the DLA system is a  matter that officials must wrestle with. They do so well in most circumstances.  Anyone who has been through the system and has seen how it works understands  those complexities.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, a number of those complexities could be set aside,  almost automatically, if DLA were regulated by way of medical conditions. For  example, blindness, epilepsy or ME could automatically attract one or both of  the components of DLA. That would save officials from having to trawl through a  complex application, and, indeed, save the applicant from having to go through  that process, or an appeal process.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I will reflect upon the Member&rsquo;s submission and come  back to him directly.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Criticism is often made of the length and complexity of the  disability living allowance claim form, and I cannot extract myself from that.  As an MLA in South Down, I am very conscious of the complexity of the DLA  application form and the difficulties that many people encounter when trying to  complete it. That is why there are a range of services out there through the  advice service network and, of course, constituency offices. As the Member for  North Antrim Mr Paisley Jnr said, considerable time has to be set aside to  assist people in understanding the type of information that they should be  providing in relation to their medical condition, and how that impacts on their  ability to carry out certain functions.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I fully understand and share the concerns raised by all  Members. The current layout of the form is designed to capture the information  necessary to determine the appropriate entitlement in accordance with the  existing legislative rules. Nevertheless, my Department, in conjunction with  our colleagues in the Department for Work and Pensions, keeps that claim form  under continual review. In recent years, significant improvements have been  made that make it easier to complete. The form now follows a logical flow and  tries to free people from having to read and complete unnecessary questions.  Some questions have been removed or combined to reduce repetition for the  applicant, and there are more tick-box answers to simplify completion and to  get more relevant information as early as possible in the claims process. The  current claim form has received a crystal mark from the Plain English Campaign.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Nonetheless, I will be very happy to receive suggestions  from members of the Social Development Committee, and other Members, on how  that paperwork might be further improved without losing its utility. One of the  reasons for that is that the vast majority of applicants find themselves in  very difficult circumstances. I agree with Members: not only do applicants have  to contend with and endure their disability, but they may have family members  in the same household with a disability, similar or otherwise. I like to think  that my officials, and all those involved in the process, are compassionate and  show support to people.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>:  Does the Minister agree that for those people who are disallowed and decide to  make an appeal, the tribunal itself is often a very harrowing experience? Will  she re-examine, in so far as she can, the dreadful experience that people have  to go through at a tribunal, which very often ends in tears and the inability  to continue?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I am fully aware of the appeals process, having  participated in appeals tribunals myself before becoming Minister. I know how  harrowing they are, not only for the applicant, but, maybe, for the  representative. Notwithstanding that, appeals are not a matter for my  Department or me; that clearly lies with the First Minister and deputy First  Minister, because they hold the ministerial responsibility for the appeals  service. I have taken the matter up with them before, and will do so again.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I have little time, but I will do so for my colleague.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Thank you very much, Minister. Despite some improvement, people still find the  disability living allowance application form very complex. The Minister and  other Members will have shared that experience, having filled in many forms on  behalf of people.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The tribunal and appeals services can be complicated, but  that is often due to the personalities involved as opposed to any deficiency in  their training. On a positive note, I recognise some of the officials who are  here today, and I thank them, in particular for their customer service. Despite  the delays and difficulties that some applicants experience, on contacting  individuals in customer services, some of whom are here today, any problems are  dealt with speedily and efficiently.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank Mr McGlone for his intervention, and I will  ensure that his good wishes and thanks are passed on to the officials  concerned.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I recognise that the claim form can be daunting and  off-putting for some people and, therefore, assistance with the completion of  claim forms is available at local social security jobs and benefits offices, or  by phone from the disability and carers services. Alongside that, the voluntary  advice sector in Northern    Ireland provides a similar claim form completion  service. I am aware that the forms are long and complex, but I am heartened  that Professor Eileen Evason, a well-known commentator on social security  matters, recently remarked that people in Northern   Ireland get more help with completing forms than those in  Britain.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I assure Members that my officials proactively consult  citizens advice bureaux, Advice NI, the Law Centre and Disability Action, and  they, based on their knowledge of users&rsquo; experience, help to simplify the  application process. That approach provides a gateway for key client groups,  such as the disabled, to influence the design and content not only of the  disability living allowance claim form but of current processes and new  initiatives.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Recently, I visited the disability and carers service,  which administers DLA. I was highly impressed by the technology of document  imaging and electronic workflow management that is used to process claims. That  IT system is unique in the delivery of social security benefits in Northern Ireland and in Great Britain,  and it has streamlined the claims process for disability living allowance. I  was also impressed by the attitude of staff and management who take pride in  making a difference and helping those who are genuinely entitled to the  benefit. It is a great tribute to them that the results are as good as they  are, and I encourage the Committee to accept the standing invitation to visit  the disability and carers service to see, at first hand, the administration of  disability living allowance.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I note the Committee&rsquo;s concerns about the decision-making  and evidence-gathering process. Decisions on entitlement involve a high degree  of judgement and the interpretation of detailed medical evidence. To facilitate  that, decision-makers are specifically trained on a comprehensive 12-week  programme. That training is enhanced by the provision of medical education  awareness seminars, given by experienced medical professionals, on complex  disabilities, such as autism, fibromyalgia and cancer. Full-time medical  officers are also on site to provide assistance to decision-makers on any  medical issues that arise during the processing of claims.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">To further support decision-makers, the detailed medical  guidance on a wide spectrum of disabilities that is available online helps to  identify the most appropriate source of evidence. Further evidence is obtained  from a wide range of sources, such as general practitioners, examining medical  practitioners and other healthcare professionals and, in cases involving  children, reports from schools.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I take seriously my responsibility to ensure that those who  are entitled to the benefit receive it. In simple terms, disability living  allowance is a benefit paid to meet the additional costs associated with severe  disabilities. Many people must endure their disabilities alone, without the  support of family, and that can be an extremely difficult, onerous and lonely  life. Entitlement is based on individual need rather than on the disability.  People with the same disability may have different needs and are, consequently,  entitled to different rates of benefit.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Several Members mentioned anomalies in disability living  allowance. Mickey Brady outlined the case of two children with Down&rsquo;s syndrome.  He should refer any specific details about that case to me, so that a further  investigation might take place.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">1.15 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Members referred to &ldquo;almost&rdquo; the same circumstances. It is  rare that a disability will impact on people in exactly the same way. Benefit  entitlement is based on individual need and not paid by disability. Furthermore,  Members should be aware that periods of award are subject to accuracy  monitoring.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Over the past five years, service delivery has improved,  and a step change has occurred. However, I assure Members that my officials and  I will not become complacent. I welcome the debate, and the Committee for  Social Development&rsquo;s constructive contribution to it. I will write to  individual Members who have raised issues, and I will issue a formal response  to the Committee in due course. I look forward to considering, in detail, the  feasibility, financial costs and operational implications of the  recommendations, in order to facilitate further improvements to the  administration of disability living allowance.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Miss McIlveen</strong>:  I am grateful for Members&rsquo; comments and for their participation in what has  been a frank debate. Many Members have first-hand experience of helping  constituents to complete DLA application forms and of supporting constituents  during the appeals process. We have all experienced similar problems, and it is  evident that issues must be addressed. I thank the Minister for attending the  debate and for her positive comments.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Disability affects a large number of people in Northern Ireland.  Therefore, whether they are eligible for DLA &mdash; an important benefit &mdash; can have  a huge impact on their lives. As the Minister stated, the Committee for Social  Development is very busy, but it is committed to improving the administration  of DLA. In order to facilitate that improvement, the report has made a number  of recommendations, which have been debated.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As Mr Brady correctly stated, the Committee cannot readily  change parity legislation, and it does not propose to do so. The report aims to  improve administration of DLA and to achieve excellence in that process. As the  Minister said, Mr Brady expressed concerns about inconsistencies in the  adjudication system and cited the example of two children with Down&rsquo;s syndrome.  Furthermore, he highlighted the necessity of using presiding officers.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Maginness stated the importance of presenting quality  evidence to the decision-maker to ensure that it reflects applicants&rsquo;  circumstances. He highlighted, as did Ms Lo, Mr Craig, Mr Paisley Jnr and  others, the need for a new and simpler application form that can meet community  needs. Mr Maginness indicated that such a change would not signify a break with  parity.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Ms Lo, rightly, commended the SSA. The report was not  intended to criticise its staff; rather, its intention was to highlight the  challenges that they face. She outlined the importance of reaching  hard-to-reach groups against the backdrop of reducing funding for neighbourhood  renewal, peace projects, and so on.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Armstrong referred to the high number of DLA claimants  in Northern Ireland  and offered suggestions on how personal actions can reduce the burden placed on  the state by benefits such as DLA.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Craig outlined the difficulties that the complex,  bureaucratic process causes for claimants and staff. He remarked on the absence  of satisfaction-monitoring and warned of the adverse impact of random  reassessment of DLA cases when the disability and carers strategy ends.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Fra McCann highlighted the injustice of inconsistent  judgements and commented on the absence of information. Moreover, he outlined  the importance of the role of carers and indicated that DLA administration must  be improved in order to reduce pressure on those individuals. All Members will  have experienced that issue in their constituencies.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Paisley Jnr highlighted the difficulties of interpreting  medical evidence &mdash; a concern that we heard throughout today&rsquo;s debate. He also  recommended that an independent medical advisor should be appointed to help and  to provide advice to claimants. Mr Cobain &mdash; who is no longer in the Chamber &mdash;  suggested that DLA can play a positive role by lifting claimants out of  poverty. He also highlighted the importance of considering the impact that DLA  has on the mobility and care needs of claimants.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n raised concerns about the use of GP reports  in DLA assessments and about examining practitioners.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I now turn to the comments that were made by the Minister,  and I thank her for those, particularly as she commended the Committee for its  work on the report and on the volume of work that it undertook over the past  year. I welcome the fact that she said that she will respond to our report, and  I look forward to a very positive outcome.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee welcomes the Minister&rsquo;s remarks in relation  to tough public service agreement targets on accuracy for DLA and other  benefits. It is telling that the Minister has personal experience of the  system&rsquo;s difficulties, and she said that she will strive to make it better, so  that some of the current complexities are avoided. The Minister also asserted  that the Department is not complacent; we hope that that is the case.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We appreciate that the Department has been reviewing the  application form, but further improvement is required. The Committee might  accept the Minister&rsquo;s invitation be involved in a further review of the claim  form. We welcome the Minister&rsquo;s acceptance that individuals find tribunals  harrowing, and we are interested to learn of the additional efforts that are  being made in Northern    Ireland to help claimants to complete the  forms and, thereby, avoid going before those tribunals. The Committee will be  pleased to consider the Minister&rsquo;s invitation to review the improved IT systems  that will streamline DLA claims.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">On behalf of the Committee for Social Development, I thank  all Members who contributed to this important debate. In producing the report,  I assure the House that it was the Committee&rsquo;s intention to provide helpful direction  to the Department concerning the improvement of the administration of  disability living allowance. I trust that the Minister will, therefore, take  proper account of the Committee&rsquo;s recommendations, and I look forward to  receiving a detailed response from her in relation to the ways in which the  Committee&rsquo;s recommendations will be addressed. I commend the motion to the  House.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>

		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour and 30  minutes for the debate. The proposer of the motion will have 10 minutes in  which to propose and 10 minutes in which to make a winding-up speech. All other  Members who wish to speak will have five minutes. One amendment has been  selected and published on the Marshalled List. The proposer of the amendment  will have 10 minutes in which to propose and five minutes in which to make a  winding-up speech.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Adams</strong>: I  beg to move</p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly calls for an inter-departmental,  multi-disciplinary strategy, informed by the Patten report and the Criminal  Justice Review report 2000, to include proposals on alcohol-related crime and  prolific offenders, aimed at reducing harm and promoting safety in local  communities, to be led by the First Minister and deputy First Minister.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Maith th&uacute;, a LeasCheann Comhairle. T&aacute; m&eacute; ag labhairt i  bhfabhar an r&uacute;in, n&oacute; creidim gur &aacute;bhar an-t&aacute;bhachtach &eacute; seo. Caithfidh m&eacute; a r&aacute;  go bhfuil cruinni&uacute; agam leis an Aire Gregory Campbell i rith na d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireachta,  agus mar sin go mbeidh orm imeacht roimh dheireadh na d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireachta. Ba mhaith  liom a r&aacute; anois go bhfuil br&oacute;n orm faoi sin.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I have a meeting this afternoon with the Minister of  Culture, Arts and Leisure, Gregory Campbell, and it might coincide with this  debate, so excuse me if that is the case, a LeasCheann Comhairle.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to deal with the amendment from the Member for East  Belfast Ms Purvis. The motion is about an inter-departmental,  multi-disciplinary strategy. The amendment provides some detail of that  strategy, but it is not at variance with the motion. In order to achieve  consensus on the issue, and because I agree with the thrust of the amendment, I  tried to propose a composite motion that included some of the amendment&rsquo;s  content.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, by the time that I saw that amendment, we had  missed the deadline. Therefore, I ask the Assembly to support the motion,  rather than the amendment, if only because the motion deals with the Criminal  Justice Review 2000, and I have explained that to the Member who proposed the  amendment.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We all recognise the fact that community safety is one of  the most important and pressing matters that our society faces. There are  problems with antisocial and criminal behaviour, assaults on young women, car  hijackings by thugs, elderly people being terrorised in their homes, citizens  being badly beaten &mdash; some to death &mdash; and citizens being stabbed or murdered.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Every citizen has a right to a safe environment, and the  Assembly has an obligation to create such an environment. Ach, a LeasCheann  Comhairle, n&iacute;l muid a dh&eacute;anamh sin. However, we are failing to create such an  environment.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We have the potential and the ability to legislate better  and more effectively on such matters than any British direct rule Minister.  Moreover, we have the right to do so, and I believe that the confidence exists  among the public for us to do so.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Next Monday, the NIO will publish a community safety  strategy for consultation, yet, today, we are discussing the need for a  community safety strategy. An agency that is outside the Assembly&rsquo;s scrutiny  and influence will produce a strategy that no Member will have seen. It is not  as though the political parties here do not have opinions about community  safety. Quite rightly, all parties have an opinion and, quite rightly, they  made those opinions and ideas known to the Independent Commission on Policing,  which emerged as a consequence of the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The &lsquo;Criminal Justice Review Implementation Plan&rsquo; of  November 2001 discussed community safety, stating:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;On devolution, we recommend that the Community Safety  Unit be located within the Office of the First Minister and Deputy First  Minister &hellip; steps should be taken through central machinery to ensure that  community safety is addressed on a co-ordinated, inter-departmental basis.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">During negotiations to amend policing legislation, Sinn  F&eacute;in successfully persuaded the British Govern&shy;ment to ensure that policing in  the community is a statutory requirement for all police officers. In addition,  the Patten Report envisaged that district policing partner&shy;ships (DPPs) would  exercise responsibility for community safety. Currently, DPPs do not have the  opportunity to direct such resources. Instead, interim arrangements have been  made for community safety partnerships, and a budget has been allocated for  that by the NIO.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Interestingly, Criminal Justice Inspection (CJINI) examined  those arrangements and found them to be ineffective. Therefore, this is not  just a matter of institutional reform. The Assembly must concern itself with  putting arrangements in place to promote community safety. Is it doing what the  public expects or requires of it?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">For example, there is widespread concern about the link  between alcohol use and crime against the person. In addition, drinking in  public places is a major issue, and that is compounded by the fact that the  regulation of drinking in public places is primarily a local government matter.  The PSNI says that it cannot arrest people for breaking the relevant by-laws.  Instead, it refers any breaches to local councils for further action, and it is  up to the councils to bring such matters before the courts. Is rud millteanach  amaideach &eacute;; n&iacute;l ciall ar bith ann.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">If Members have any sense of what goes on at district  policing partnership meetings, it is apparent that people from local  communities want the problem to be effectively tackled. In public parks, public  places and play spaces, every citizen should be able to relax and enjoy  themselves in safety. In addition, there is a problem with the sale of alcohol  to underage people and with prolific offenders who repeatedly harm others. Yet,  at this time, no Member can bring forward legislation to deal with such matters,  and many local communities are distraught at the inability of the criminal  justice system and statutory bodies to contend with prolific offenders.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Many communities also feel that there are inconsistencies  in the application of police and court bail.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">1.30 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The introduction of legislation is crucial to tackling  those matters. However, some important steps can be taken now. One such example  is the intervention project in the upper Springfield  area of west Belfast.  That project has led to the creation of an upper Springfield  safer neighbourhood forum &mdash; an idea that has been extended to all parts of west  Belfast,  including the Shankill area. Such schemes represent a new type of partnership  between local communities and the statutory sector, and can be developed  further.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">For decades, some of those local communities have developed  and promoted policies to eradicate poverty and to deal with poor health, low  educational achievement, and the lack of community resources. That work is  ongoing, because crime &mdash; particularly antisocial behaviour &mdash; does not occur in  a vacuum. Some such young people feel alienated and have low self-esteem; some  have parenting and other family difficulties; most are unemployed, and I  believe that 50% of young people who are currently detained are from an  institutional-care background.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We have a duty to examine and correct those dimensions of  the problem. Social justice and the rights of citizens demand that. It also  makes good sense in the battle against crime. I appreciate the efforts of those  involved in that pioneering work, and I foresee many possibilities emerging  from those engagements.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I commend community programmes such as community  restorative justice and Greater Shankill Alternatives, which have already  broken new ground in their field. There are other schemes, such as community  courts, which are currently in use in Liverpool, that could have a role to play  here, as could some of the innovative ideas emerging from the joint-policing  committees in Dublin  and elsewhere throughout the island.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, I commend the motion to the Assembly. This is an  opportune time for the development of an interdepartmental multidisciplinary  strategy aimed at reducing harm and promoting safety in local communities. Even  if we had a justice Department, the cross-departmental and multi-agency focus  required by such a strategy could best be taken forward through the Office of  the First and deputy First Minister.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">T&aacute; seanfhocal ann &oacute; thaobh an &aacute;bhair seo: ceart dom, ceart  duit. Caithfimid a bheith &aacute;balta pobal s&aacute;bh&aacute;ilte a chruth&uacute;, agus creidim go  dtiocfaidh linn f&eacute;in sin a dh&eacute;anamh. Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat, a LeasCheann  Comhairle.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Purvis</strong>: I  beg to move the following amendment: Leave out all after &ldquo;Assembly&rdquo; and insert</p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;recognises that offending and anti-social behaviour is often  the result of unmet, complex social, educational and health needs; and calls for  an inter-departmental, cross-sectional strategy, led by the First Minister and  deputy First Minister, that ensures safer communities by addressing issues of  poverty, poor health, low educational achievement and lack of community and  public resources.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The issues of community safety and antisocial behaviour  have been recurring themes in the business of the Assembly. Despite extensive  debate and police reports of Northern Ireland crime levels as among the lowest  in the UK and of declining incidents of alcohol-related crime, such issues  remain dominant topics on the radio, and in our newspapers and constituency  offices. Therefore, we are clearly not doing enough to fully understand and  address those issues.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">When I first read the motion, I had mixed reactions. On one  hand, I agree with the proposers that reducing harm and promoting safety in  local communities is a critical issue. I see and hear that every day from  constituents who are worried about perceived rising rates of crime and what  they see as a deterioration of behaviour among some of our young people.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I also agree that further action on alcohol-related crime  is necessary. We know that alcohol use among young people is disturbingly on  the rise and that it is often a factor in incidents of abuse and disruptive  behaviour.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The issue of prolific offenders also deserves specific  consideration. Often, one or two individuals are regularly involved in  problematic behaviour and serve as ringleaders &mdash; encouraging others to join in.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Those are, undoubtedly, complex problems that will be  effectively addressed only by an interdepartmental, multidisciplinary strategy.  The Assembly has recognised consistently that many of the challenges that we  face must be approached with a comprehensive perspective that takes full account  of the entire picture and involves all relevant stakeholders and Departments.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Societal problems do not present themselves so conveniently  that they fit neatly into one ministerial portfolio and one budget. I,  therefore, agree with the element of the motion that states that an  interdepartmental, cross-sectoral strategy, led by the First Minister and  deputy First Minister, is necessary to deal with the complex issues affecting  community security. However, I do not agree with the manner in which the motion  recommends that such problems will be approached. To invoke the Patten Report  and the report of the Criminal Justice Review assumes that it is best to  approach problematic behaviour punitively, when, in fact, we know that that has  severe limitations.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">To suggest that the application of policing and criminal  justice holds the key to dealing with destructive behaviours that are affecting  our communities is akin to applying a plaster to a gaping wound: it may stop  the bleeding in one small area for a few minutes, but it will not solve the  problems. Such an approach criminalises problems that are not based in  criminality. I accept that the proposer of the motion, Gerry Adams, tried to  address those issues in his contribution, but it is not explicit in the wording  of the motion.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Antisocial, abusive and disruptive behaviour are, in most  cases, the result of complex, unmet needs. That is particularly true when the  behaviour is repeated, creating prolific offenders, who enter the criminal  justice system as juveniles and remain there for life. Punitive measures may  make us feel good in the moment, and they might teach the offender a lesson,  but, because they do not deal with the causes of antisocial &mdash; or even criminal  &mdash; behaviour at their source, they solve little. Furthermore, they are  expensive. If an encounter with the police or a spell in custody is what we are  offering as solutions to complex societal problems, we are failing our children  and young people.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The challenges of what we are calling &ldquo;antisocial  behaviour&rdquo; are not limited to one area, neighbourhood or community in Northern Ireland;  they are an issue for our society.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The amendment in my name attempts to address the source of  the problems that lead to destructive behaviours, stating that the Assembly  should call for:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;an inter-departmental, cross-sectional strategy, led  by the First Minister and deputy First Minister, that ensures safer communities  by addressing issues of poverty, poor health, low educational achievement and  lack of community and public resources.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Those are the issues that are, typically, at the  heart of the problems that we are trying to address. Only by applying a  strategy of prevention and diversion will we remove and address the failures  that lead to offending and antisocial behaviour.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The profile of the majority of young offenders who are in  custody is similar. Most of them have familial problems, come from poverty or  from disadvantaged backgrounds, have low educational attainment, and a lack of  confidence and self-esteem. What are we doing to our society when those young  people feel safer and more comfortable when they are in an institution? There  is something seriously wrong.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We must look at alternatives and examine any options that  will help provide young offenders with the chance to understand the impact of  their behaviour. Furthermore, we must support communities and individual  victims of crime. It is imperative that the behaviour is addressed, and it is  important that the issue is dealt with holistically.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Alcohol use among young people is rising. The reason for  that increase is not merely because alcohol is available in all colours of the  rainbow or is cheaper to buy than a bottle of milk &mdash; though it is easy to point  at those factors &mdash; rather, it is because children and young people choose to  drink alcohol, which they will obtain by whatever means necessary. That is why  I said that the issue must be dealt with holistically. To take alcohol from  young people and pour it down the drain will not work; they will go out and buy  more when they get the money.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The amendment is not a licence for criminal, abusive or  antisocial behaviour; nor is it an attempt to excuse, forgive or ignore such  behaviour. However, the Assembly must recognise that we will not make our  communities or our young people feel safer simply by punishing them.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The amendment will drive policy that is based on a holistic  understanding of the reasons and causes behind destructive behaviours so that  we can address them effectively and earlier, when it is easier and more  affordable to do so.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Any approach that we take will be less expensive than  sending a sizeable proportion of our youth through the criminal justice system,  most likely for life.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCausland</strong>:  Many polls have been carried out on issues that are a priority for people in  our communities, and one issue appears at the top of the list, time and time  again &mdash; particularly in surveys carried out by district policing partnerships  and the Police Service of Northern Ireland &mdash; is antisocial behaviour and  attacks on people and property. Not only is it the top priority for members of  the public but a recent Assembly question for written answer highlighted the  fact that there are many violent attacks on hospital staff, which is another  example of unacceptable and antisocial behaviour. Across the board, antisocial  behaviour is recognised as the top priority for most people.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Why do we have problems associated with antisocial, violent  and unacceptable behaviour? The motion is correct in recognising that a range  of factors, rather than a single one, contributes to such behaviour. Community  cohesion has broken down, and there is a lack of respect and regard for others;  there are also societal issues. The media glamorises alcohol-fuelled behaviour  as though it were perfectly acceptable and normal, and is something that all  young people do. Therefore, it is not surprising that other young people pick  up on that behaviour.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Family breakdown is also an issue. We must consider how we  can support and strengthen the family unit, because strong families will create  a much more stable, strong and coherent society.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We must also recognise human rights issues. Measures have  been introduced to tackle some aspects of the problem of antisocial behaviour,  but they have run into conflict with the human rights lobby. There was a  bizarre situation in which legislation was being introduced to regularise the  process of using test purchases in off-licences to try to detect off-licences  that were selling alcohol to underage people. The Human Rights Commission told us  that it was a breach of the human rights of young people; however, the  commission give no thought to the human rights of the people who are affected  by alcohol-fuelled antisocial behaviour. A whole range of factors is involved &mdash;  societal, family, community and the bizarre human rights arguments.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There is also the legacy of violence. For years, young  people in some communities were taught that it was right to riot: rioting was  turned on and off for political ends. As a result, those young people got the  message that it is perfectly all right to riot as they had been taught to do  so, year after year. However, having turned on the rioting, it has become  difficult for some communities to turn it off. That rioting is not always  directed towards the police or the Army; it is quite often directed towards  people in their own communities.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Any response to the situation must be multidisciplinary and  interdepartmental. The Department for Social Development must play a role in  introducing legislation. I have already pointed out that much unacceptable  behaviour is alcohol-fuelled. People have been battered to death by young  people roaming around at night in a state of intoxication. Legislation on  alcohol is a matter for the Department for Social Development.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department of Education has responsibility for the  Youth Service and citizenship in schools; the Department of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety has a role to ensure public safety; and one could  list various responsibilities for other Departments. The motion is correct in  calling for an interdepartmental and multidisciplinary approach.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Several good community safety initiatives exist, and there  are also good examples of diversionary projects that encourage young people  towards better behaviour and other activities.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">My final point relates to the reference to the 2000 &lsquo;Review  of the Criminal Justice System in Northern Ireland&rsquo; in the motion,  which I do not want to allow to pass unnoticed.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion proposes that an interdepartmental, multi-disciplinary  strategy be informed by the Criminal Justice Review report. However, some areas  of that review give me cause for concern, particularly the proposal to replace  the district policing partnerships with community safety and policing  partnerships. My issue is not with the principle of DPPs having more  responsibility; rather, it is with the manner in which the matter would be  dealt with. There are already major concerns about DPPs; if their  responsibilities were increased, so, too, would the number of concerns about  them.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">1.45 pm</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  The wording of the motion lacks the clear definition that is needed to give it  practical meaning. Although it refers to an interdepartmental,  multi-disciplinary strategy, it does nothing to define what Departments and  disciplines would be involved. I fear that, without that sharpness of  definition, the motion is in danger of becoming a mere platitude. Of course, we  are used to hearing platitudes from Sinn F&eacute;in Members; they are full of words,  but strangely bereft of hard-headed, practical common sense. The sponsors of  this motion refer specifically &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Does the Member ever consult his  colleagues on the Policing Board, who might give him a perspective entirely different  from the very shallow one that he has just outlined?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I will address all those issues shortly.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The proposers of the motion refer to the Patten Report. I  must remind them that the Patten Report specifically says that:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;policing with the community should be the core  function of the police service and the core function of every police station &hellip;  every neighbourhood (or rural area) should have a dedicated policing team with  lead responsibility for policing its area &hellip; members of the policing team should  serve at least three and preferably five years in the same neighbourhood&rdquo;.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Another recommendation is that:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;neighbourhood policing teams be empowered to  determine their own local priorities and set their own objectives, within the  overall Annual Policing Plan and in consultation with community  representatives.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Notice the importance of the PSNI in those recommendations.  The Patten Report clearly emphasises the primacy and centrality of the PSNI in  any neighbourhood policing strategy. It would, therefore, have been appropriate  for the motion to refer to the PSNI, considering its overwhelming leadership  role in the delivery of any strategy. Moreover, until policing and justice  powers are devolved to the Assembly, if ever, it is premature for the Assembly  to debate justice-focused measures. Until those powers reside with the Assembly  &mdash; and while policing matters affect the constituents of every Member &mdash; the  implementation of any policing strategy will still involve bodies that are  outside the Assembly&rsquo;s control.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is not as if we do not have plenty of other matters to  discuss. People expect us to deal with measures that will help them to survive  the credit crunch and the world economic downturn. In fact, they expect us not  only to talk, but to do. Sinn F&eacute;in proposes a motion that mentions  co-ordination and interdepartmental and multi-disciplinary strategies, while  preventing the one main co-ordinating body of the Assembly &mdash; the Executive  Committee &mdash; from meeting. That seems to me, and to the public whom I represent,  to be mere political humbug.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In this motion, Sinn F&eacute;in calls for the strategy to be led  by the First Minister and deputy First Minister. That is laughable, given that  the two Ministers cannot even meet to organise an Executive meeting, despite  the massive backlog of Assembly papers. The Assembly has become a byword for  non-activity. As a consequence, the Assembly is in a complete shambles. It has  an Executive who do not meet and an Education Minister who has brought the  education system to the point of meltdown. No decisions have been made on the  national stadium or PPS 14.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We have a Minister of the Environment who does not appear  to understand the basics of the road-tax and MOT system that he administers. In  the midst of the shambles, we are confronted with the sheer cheek of a Sinn  F&eacute;in&rsquo;s motion that calls for action from the Executive and its First Minister  and deputy First Minister. That is the same Executive that Sinn F&eacute;in is  preventing from meeting &mdash; one just could not make it up.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I will not deal with the points that Mr Kennedy raised. However, what he said  has much currency, and many people will agree with him. Despite our political  difficulties, I will try to position the issue to respond best to the needs of  the community.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Nobody can seriously dispute the need for an  interdisciplinary, multi-departmental approach to community and social issues.  However, a common feature of all recent cases of public concern in this part of  the world is the administration of criminal justice. A concern about all those  cases &mdash; whether they relate to kidnapping and bank-robbing, knife deaths or  attacks on old women &mdash; is the conduct and management of the Public Prosecution  Service in Northern Ireland.  That is the elephant in the Assembly.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Members of the Policing Board can call the police to  account. However, even if policing and justice powers are devolved, we will not  be able to call the Director of the Public Prosecution Service and his office  to account on why cases are pursued despite a lack of evidence; why cases  collapse without reasons being given; and why plea bargains are entered into  when the entire community thinks that the loudest message should be sent out  about issues such as knife crime. I want to address that elephant in the Chamber.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister  (OFMDFM) may or may not get its act together, and there may or may not be an  interdepartmental strategy to deal with such matters. However, unless changes  are made, public confidence in the Public Prosecution Service will not reach  the level of confidence that is beginning to be achieved in policing and in the  Police Ombudsman. I acknowledge Gerry Adams&rsquo;s reference to the report from  2000, &lsquo;Review of the Criminal Justice System in Northern Ireland&rsquo;, on the future  administration of criminal justice. However, the SDLP feels that that report  does not go far enough. If public confidence is to be built, a fundamental  reassessment of the Public Prosecution Service is required in order to make it  fit for purpose and accountable to the community that it serves.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP believes that an OFMDFM-led initiative must  include a sentencing guidelines council. There is such a council in England, in  which a wide range of people advises the judiciary on sentencing practice in  cases of public concern. The Public Prosecution Service needs a management  board &agrave; la Patten and the Policing Board &mdash; one that does not interfere with its  operational responsibility but that calls it to account on how it is funded, is  managed and makes decisions, especially in cases of public concern. Just like  our policing arrangements, the Public Prosecution Service needs an independent  complaints mechanism so that any families that have problems with how their  cases were managed by the Public Prosecution Service, and how those cases ended  in disrepute, have a basis &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. I have listened to the debate, and Members must try to stick to the  motion and the business that is on the Floor of the House. I am listening  carefully to Members, some of whom have gone outside the remit of the motion.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  Thank you, Mr Speaker. The motion calls for the inclusion of proposals that  are: &ldquo;aimed at reducing harm and promoting safety in local communities&rdquo;.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">If we do not deal with the way in which one of the  primary criminal justice agencies in Northern Ireland, which is  responsible for reducing harm and promoting safety in local communities,  conducts its affairs and does or does not prosecute individuals in this state,  we are missing a serious point. Therefore, although I take note of what you  have said, Mr Speaker, I certainly am speaking to the motion.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. The Member must be careful. He has almost reached the point where he is  challenging the authority of the Speaker. He must be very, very careful.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I am not challenging your authority or your ruling. My comments are consistent  with what you outlined to the Chamber. I assume that I have an additional  minute in which to speak.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In addition to dealing with that matter on a  multi-disciplinary &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. The Member&rsquo;s time is up. I ask the Member to take his seat.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  The Alliance Party welcomes the motion and supports it as it stands. Although  we recognise the merit of the amendment, we oppose it, because we do not view  it as being in line with the spirit of the motion.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Alliance Party will always argue against any attempt to  distinguish between the content of a motion such as this one and the reality of  ongoing paramilitary activity, including murals and the territorial marking of  property. The Assembly should support the motion in order to prove its disgust  at, for instance, last week&rsquo;s arms find and to completely condemn ongoing  so-called loyalist paramilitary activity and so-called dissident republican  activity. Therefore, the unionist parties should support the motion as it  stands. We can agree on a motion that focuses on causes on another occasion.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">What should the Assembly say about the symptoms of  paramilitary behaviour? Much greater clarity is needed on the recent arms find,  and it must be understood that, whether UVF-related or otherwise, it proves  that so-called loyalists cannot put weapons beyond use on their own terms. That  process must be completed in the presence of independent observers.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, devolution of policing and justice would  better enable a joined-up approach to those issues, as all the relevant  agencies would come under the ultimate authority of the Northern Ireland  Executive. Of course, that would only apply if the Northern Ireland Executive  ever get down to meeting.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. The motion is wide-ranging, but all sides of the House and the Member  must try to address it.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  Mr Speaker, I will do my best to yield to your command.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Issues such as access to alcohol in supermarkets &mdash; you see,  I am getting to the point &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">&mdash; where it can be bought in bulk more cheaply than  water, and illegal drugs on the streets must be tackled. The latter of those  issues must not progress to the problem of harder drugs, which blights cities  such as Dublin and Glasgow. Many experts point out that hard  drugs are responsible for the higher crime rates in those cities compared with  those in Belfast and the rest of Northern Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Although it is reasonable to talk about rationalising  community safety partnerships and district policing partnerships, the motion  shows that their work must be properly funded. I pay tribute to all of the work  that is carried by the local community safety partnerships and district  policing partnerships in all the localities in Northern Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We cannot run away from the issue of paramilitarism and so-called  dissident activity; unfortunately, it hasn&rsquo;t gone away you know.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">2.00 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Policing and justice powers must also be devolved to a  functioning Executive sooner rather than later. That would ensure that issues  such as access to alcohol and drugs, which render too many communities unsafe,  are better tackled. It would also help to ensure that policing is properly  funded and resourced. Everything that can be done should be done in order to  ensure that people, in particular senior citizens, are safe in their homes.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, although the Alliance Party recognises the  amendment&rsquo;s merit, the Assembly must unite behind the motion and properly  reflect on what it means. A good start would be for the lead parties in the  Executive to demonstrate more responsibility.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I will try to keep to the point as indicated by the wording of the motion.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I, like probably all elected representatives, face issues  of community safety and problems on a daily basis. I see homes every day that  are torn apart by alcohol and, to a lesser extent, by drug abuse. I see  families divided and children emotionally damaged by the misuse of alcohol and  drugs; and I know that it does not have to be that way.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion refers to:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;proposals on alcohol-related crime and prolific  offenders, aimed at reducing harm and promoting safety in local communities&rdquo;.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Those are issues that I want addressed.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Northern    Ireland is suffering from an epidemic of  domestic violence. It is estimated that some one in four women in the Province  have been physically abused by their partners. In the majority of those cases,  alcohol misuse is the major factor. Every year, 1&middot;5 million people in the UK fall victim  to alcohol-fuelled violence. It is clear that community safety is threatened by  the misuse of alcohol.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Police superintendents say that alcohol plays a part in  half of all crime. A study for the Home Office in 1990 found that growth in  beer consumption, for example, was the single most important factor in  explaining a growth in violent crime against the person. Research also shows  that high proportions of victims of violent crime are drinking, or are under  the influence of alcohol, at the time of assault. An analysis of data from the  41 probation areas between 1 April 2004 and 31 March 2005 by the offender assessment  system data evaluation and analysis team &mdash; that is a big sentence and a big  name for any group &mdash; found that 37% of offenders had a current problem with  alcohol. A similar proportion &mdash; 37% &mdash; had a problem with binge drinking. Nearly  half &mdash; 47% &mdash; had misused alcohol in the past, and 32% had records of violent  behaviour that was related to their alcohol use. Those statistics are  horrifying and worrying and make it clear that a change is needed.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There may not be the same spread of drug abuse in the Province  as on the mainland, but it is definitely on the rise, and misuse at any level  is too high. There exists a culture among young people who believe that a joint  of cannabis every so often will do no harm. It is time to dispel that myth.  Medical evidence shows that the use of cannabis leads to mental-health problems  that have been previously discussed in the Chamber, and on which the Minister  of Health has commented.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Unless problems are dealt with now they will grow to  immense proportions. That is what the motion attempts to address. What is  possibly less clear is the solution. I work with many community and residents&rsquo;  associations in my constituency. They are determined to stamp out abuse in  their areas, and do so in many ways &mdash; through education programmes for  children, through ensuring that there is a safer option available for children  than standing at street corners, where they may be pressurised into trying  alcopops, smoking or taking drugs.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Community groups in my area are working hard to break the  vicious circle of alcoholism and drug use. They cannot do that on their own,  which is where the crux of the motion comes into play. A system must be put in  place that lends support, offers advice, and co-ordinates events and  information in order to ensure that people are informed. With the limited  resources at its disposal for community policing, the PSNI does a wonderful job  in my constituency. Ards is privileged to have community police officers who  are well known and who do an excellent job in relation to antisocial behaviour  in the community, and in dealing with the young people involved. However, they  cannot do enough; they cannot shoulder the burden. It is for that reason that  we must consider the wording of the motion.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The strategy must span all Departments, as they will be the  winners. Young people could be taught how to drink in moderation through  programmes co-ordinated by community groups and funded by the Department for  Social Development (DSD). The Health Service would also be a winner, as it would  no longer have its weekend influx of people with injuries caused by  overindulgence in alcohol. The Department of Health funds and co-ordinates  community projects which outline the medical problems associated with drug and  alcohol abuse.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">DSD would also be a winner, with fewer breakages and less  damage done to properties, if people realised that they were affecting their  long-term health through binge drinking.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Time does not permit me to continue illustrating the  benefits to other Departments, but it is clear that the problem can be tackled.  If it is tackled on all fronts and co-ordinated by OFMDFM, we can make a  difference and the whole of Northern    Ireland will benefit. Individual Departments  can make a difference, but if all the Departments work together, they will make  a greater change.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Anderson</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I welcome the opportunity to speak  in the debate, and I support all that my colleague Gerry Adams said.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Community safety is an issue that is being raised with us  daily on the doorsteps, and Sinn F&eacute;in believes that everyone has the right to  live safely in their home and in their community. Everyone has the right to  have a fully accountable policing service, imbued with a human rights ethos, and  to have a justice system in which they can have confidence. However, the  reality is that communities across the North are blighted by crime, antisocial  behaviour, underage drinking, drug abuse and all the associated problems.  Therefore, is it any wonder that many people have lost confidence in the  policing and justice system? Is it any wonder that pensioners are terrified in  their homes when their 999 calls go unanswered? Is it any wonder that people  from all areas, regardless of their creed or politics, are demanding action to  rid our streets of crime and antisocial behaviour?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Unmet and complex social, education and health needs must  be addressed in a holistic way. Sinn F&eacute;in believes that those needs should not  go unanswered, and there is an onus on all of us to play our part in achieving  the kind of safe society in which it is fit to raise the next generation.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As the motion states, the strategy should include  fundamental proposals on alcohol-related crime and persistent offenders. Our  communities are crying out for justice. They are sick, sore and tired of seeing  repeat offenders walk free from court with nothing more than a slap on the  wrist. They are sick, sore and tired of being scared in their own homes. They  are sick, sore and tired of watching communities being torn apart by hoods and  thugs. The vast majority of decent young people are being held to ransom by  anti-community elements.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Many Members will remember the horrific murder last year of  Jim McFadden in my constituency of Derry. He  was savagely beaten to death in front of his children after attending a family  wedding. Jim was a devoted father and husband, and his only crime was to defend  his daughter&rsquo;s honour, but he paid for it with his life.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">A number of people have appeared in court charged with Jim&rsquo;s  murder, and they have been released on bail pending their trial. Everyone has  the right to the presumption of innocence and to be granted bail where  appropriate. I fully support and defend that right, but some of the people who  stand accused of Jim&rsquo;s murder have been repeatedly brought before the courts  for breaching the conditions of their release. Time and time again, they have  been found to be in breach of their bail conditions, yet their bail has not  been revoked.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I must caution the Member to be careful about speaking on individual cases.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Anderson</strong>:  What is the point of imposing bail conditions if they are not going to be  enforced? I have met members of the McFadden family, and I am sure that other  Members have done likewise. This situation is only adding to their great  distress and anguish. Many families are suffering as a result of similar  situations. The justice system has failed many families even before trials have  begun. Similar stories are being repeated right across the North, and they are  happening in all the constituencies that we represent.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">People are rightly demanding action to end the  revolving-door justice system. For how long will those demands fall on deaf  ears, particularly those of some parties in the Assembly? The most effective  way to resolve the issues is through the transfer of policing and justice  powers as envisaged in the Patten Report, the Good Friday Agreement and the St Andrews review, in conjunction with a truly  interdepartmental multi-disciplinary strategy spearheaded by OFMDFM.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">No one will convince me that a British Minister sitting in  a comfortable leafy suburb in the garden   of England cares about  the realities of life in the Bogside, the Shankill, the Fountain or the Falls.  Even Iris Robinson recognised that point, when only this weekend she called on  British Ministers to stay out of our affairs in relation to extending Westminster legislation  to the North. I agree with Mrs Robinson; British interference in Ireland has  been going on for too long &mdash; in fact, over 800 years. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Anderson</strong>:  We need a local Minister who understands the reality of life in our community  and who is prepared to do something about it.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Moutray</strong>:  Other Members have mentioned the upsurge in alcohol-related crime and  antisocial behaviour over several years, which must be addressed urgently.  Ultimately, such behaviour is a problem plaguing many of our cities, towns and  villages, and we hear about it all too often in our constituency offices.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Alcohol-related crime and antisocial behaviour in the  community continue to cause much apprehension and concern, particularly to  elderly people and those living alone, who often fall victim to such activity.  Those types of behaviour cause undoubted misery to many individuals, families  and communities, and must be addressed.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Antisocial behaviour covers a range of selfish and  unacceptable activities that can blight the quality of community life. It does  not just make life unpleasant; it ultimately holds back the regeneration of  disadvantaged areas and creates an environment in which more serious crime can,  and often does, take hold.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Much antisocial behaviour is the result of a failed family  environment: a lack of respect within the family and in society at large; poor  schooling and educational attainment; poor community life; poor accommodation  and employment, and personal and individual factors, such as alienation and  lack of social commitment; and a large percentage of unsupervised time spent  with peers who are involved in problem behaviour.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a role for OFMDFM in reducing those problems.  However, it is important to adopt an interdepartmental approach that  encompasses all Departments. There is a role for all in trying to reduce and  eradicate antisocial behaviour. There must be a more joined-up approach to  tackling the problem head-on and dealing with it. For example, the Department  for Social Development has some responsibility for licensing and social  inclusion, while the Department of Education is responsible for educating young  people and encouraging them not to get involved in antisocial behaviour.  Furthermore, the Department of Education also has a role in helping to provide  statutory and voluntary youth activities.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Those Departments have a key role to play in reducing  antisocial behaviour, and more funding is needed to assist the provision of  youth activities. The Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety  plays an important role as regards public safety and mental-health provision.  However, there is a role for other bodies, such as HM Revenue and Customs,  which is responsible for eradicating the supply of counterfeit goods and  smuggled properties from society. The existence of such goods means that there  is a readily-available supply of alcohol and other substances that contribute  to the problem greatly.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a role for local government in facilitating  community safety partnerships and district policing partnerships in order to  tackle problems where communities are worst affected. We are faced with serious  problems, and if they are not addressed, they will spiral further out of  control.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is ironic that Sinn F&eacute;in has tabled the motion, when it  is the party that is dragging its heels on the progress of legislation through  the Assembly.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I call on that party, today, to get down to business, and  to attend the Executive meetings, which will ultimately assist in addressing  the important issues that currently affect so many in our society.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  What fiction is the Assembly being asked to support by this Sinn F&eacute;in motion?  If the First Minister and the deputy First Minister cannot organise Executive  meetings during a global economic crisis, are we really to expect that the  public will believe it when we call on them to lead a community safety  strategy? However, considering that some other parties in this House seem  intent on proceeding with that fiction, I will outline my party&rsquo;s stance on  community safety.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">At the very heart of community safety is genuine support  for the Police Service of Northern Ireland and the rule of law. Without such  support, we can have all the community safety strategies that we want, but they  will make no difference. Without support for the PSNI and the rule of law,  communities are not &mdash; and will not be &mdash; safe.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is therefore slightly disturbing that a motion on the  issue of community safety fails to explicitly refer to support for the PSNI and  the rule of law. Such an explicit statement is surely necessary, in light of  our troubled past. It is unfortunately the case that many neighbourhoods and  communities in Northern    Ireland are plagued by the continual threat  of criminal activity and antisocial behaviour. The first step in giving hope to  those communities is for all political representatives to fully, and without  equivocation, support the police and the rule of law.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">None of that is to deny that the reasons for antisocial and  criminal behaviour are complex, and that social exclusion can contribute to  both. That is why the Ulster Unionist Party is broadly supportive of the idea  of a community safety strategy, while recognising that policing and justice  powers are not devolved to the Assembly, and, quite clearly, cannot be in the  foresee&shy;able future. The district policing partnerships and community safety  partnerships provide an opportunity at a local level to co-operate on a much  better basis than is sometimes the case at the moment.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I note the work that has been carried out by the Department  of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, with the NIO, on the young people  and alcohol action plan. The Department for Social Development has also been  active in promoting community involvement in reducing crime through the  neighbourhood renewal scheme, and that is to be welcomed. That is precisely the  type of practical project that the Executive &mdash; when, or if, they eventually  meet &mdash; should concentrate on.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Alcohol-related crime is on the increase in Northern Ireland.  Crime committed under the influence of alcohol rose from 2,330 incidents  reported in 2002, to 2,932 in 2006. Drunken and disorderly behaviour is,  unfortunately, becoming more of a menace in society, and it is correct that the  motion seeks to address that. The Health Minister&rsquo;s leadership in respect of  the young people and alcohol action plan, and his recent initiatives to  highlight the impact of binge drinking, demonstrate what the Executive can do,  and should be doing, to promote community safety.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There has been some progress on support for the PSNI and  the rule of law from those in this community who formerly undermined them. I am  pleased that there has been even more recognition of that today. There is, of  course, more to be done, but a start has to be made, and it must be made  abundantly clear that, without explicit and genuine support for the PSNI and  the rule of law, all talk of a community safety strategy is nothing more than  hypocrisy. People deserve the right to feel safe in their homes and  communities. Police officers, who carry out an extremely difficult task,  deserve the support and respect of every community in Northern Ireland,  and all democratic political representatives must help to deliver that outcome.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It seems that some parties, particularly Sinn F&eacute;in, believe  that they can treat debates in this House as a bad joke. For 122 days, Sinn  F&eacute;in has blocked meetings of the Executive Committee. That blockage has its  origins in OFMDFM, and yet Sinn F&eacute;in members, including its party leader, have  proposed a motion calling for an interdepartmental, multidisciplinary strategy,  to be led by the First Minister and the deputy First Minister.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">How exactly are the First Minister and the deputy First  Minister going to lead such a strategy when they cannot even hold an Executive  meeting?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  It is regrettable that there was not a composite motion to take account of the  amendment, proposed by Ms Purvis, because much of it is quite accurate given  the number of people in young offenders&rsquo; institutions. However, it would be  wrong for the House to present the view to the public that it is only  disadvantaged families who live in marginalised communities. In my constituency  office, I often hear about parents in flash cars dropping their children off  and providing them with alcohol. Therefore, it is difficult to provide the  image that it is only people from disadvantaged communities who are involved in  antisocial behaviour.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, I accept that it is the people who live in those  areas who must deal with the reality and the consequences of crime and who  suffer most from antisocial behaviour and vandalism. Perhaps some of that is  down to Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s very belated support for policing. In the past, many  communities, in both loyalist and republican areas, were under the jackboot of  paramilitaries, and unacceptable behaviour was never dealt with by the law in  the way which it ought to have been.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Many Members have said today that the Department of Health,  Social Services and Public Safety, the Department of Education, and other  agencies have a role to play. That is quite right and proper. It is also the  case that Departments have the power &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  I am glad that the Member mentioned the roles of the Health Department, the  Education Department and other agencies. Does the Member recall a motion that I  moved some weeks ago calling on the Minister for Social Development to use her  power and influence to make it harder for young people to access drink from  off-sales and similar outlets?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member will have an extra minute in which to speak.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  Thank you, Mr Speaker. If the Minister for Social Development were allowed to  bring her papers to the Executive, perhaps the Member would see proposals that  would address some of those problems.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am the mother of four children. Parental responsibility  plays a key role in determining what happens in communities. I know that young  people who behave in an antisocial manner are often brought to their parents&rsquo;  home by the police. Indeed, I am also aware of neighbours who are concerned  about the behaviour of some young people. At a recent community group meeting  in Craigavon, the names of some young people who were messing about in the  local community were mentioned. Subsequently, the parents of the young people  named at the meeting marched to the house of the person who had named them.  Some parents do not take the concerns of the community seriously. People also  marched to the house of an eyewitness who said that, following a series of  burglaries in the area, they had seen a young person acting suspiciously.  Safeguards must be put in place for people who want to improve their  communities.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Members were right when they said the issue was about  partnership. Mr Adams talked about the district policing partnerships and the  community safety partnerships, and he is quite right: the NIO has produced a  paper; members of the Policing Board have seen it, and it was discussed at last  week&rsquo;s policing board committees. However, I do not believe that any party will  support the paper, because it seeks to diminish the role of the policing boards  and fails to deal with some of the key issues in community safety. If the key  issue is about young and disadvantaged people, surely the Executive and OFMDFM  should have published &lsquo;Lifetime Opportunities&rsquo;.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Why did Sinn F&eacute;in allow the Executive to cut funding for  children and young people if, as it says, alcohol is one of the primary causes  of young people&rsquo;s antisocial behaviour. Young people say that they commit crime  because they are bored. Members are right to say that there are societal issues  involved in dealing with alcohol-related crime.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  I notice that the Member mentioned Sinn F&eacute;in once again during her speech. Does  she remember that the Department for Social Development forgot to provide a  submission to OFMDFM during its inquiry on children and young people?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I am not sure if that claim is accurate, but it will be examined. The Member  ought to know that DSD has examined the effect of poverty children and young  people, and is doing a significant amount of work on the issue. That was  demonstrated last week when the Minister for Social Development announced  millions of pounds in additional support for neighbourhood renewal areas.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in Members seem to be sore about the some of my  points. Perhaps that is because the cap fits. As many people are beginning to  recognise, Sinn F&eacute;in has rolled over to the DUP on many issues, and, sometimes,  the truth hurts. Planning crime also affects other ministerial portfolios, such  as the Department of the Environment. There must be much more support for  families, we must examine parental responsibility and, using existing  resources, Ministers have an opportunity to examine how they can advance  strategies and actions to address antisocial behaviour and designing crime.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  As Question Time commences at 2.30 pm, I propose that Members take their ease  until that time. This debate will resume after Question Time, when the first  Member called to speak will be Mr McKay.</p>

		    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">1. <strong>Mr  McGlone </strong>asked the Minister of Education why she has turned down a  development proposal to allow the establishment of an Irish-medium post-primary  college, Col&aacute;iste Speir&iacute;n, in Cookstown.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO705/09> (AQO  705/09)</a></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Ceist uimhir a haon.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education (Ms Ruane)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">For translation purposes, the Member said: &ldquo;question No 1.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">N&iacute; f&eacute;idir le duine ar bith a bheith in amhras faoi mo  dh&iacute;lseacht f&eacute;in i leith na Gaeilge, agus is l&eacute;ir go bhfuil m&eacute; tiomanta dona  chinnti&uacute; go nd&iacute;r&iacute;tear ar an easpa shol&aacute;thar iarbhunscoile in earn&aacute;il na  Gaelscola&iacute;ochta.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">No one can doubt my commitment to Irish as a language, and  my evident determination to ensure that the lack of post-primary provision in  the Irish-medium sector is addressed. There is a demand for such provision from  parents whose children attend Irish-medium primary schools, and that was  recognised in the review of Irish-medium education. I have a copy of the review  report, in Irish and English, which my Department launched last week, and  Members will shortly receive a copy.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">My Department has a duty to encourage and facilitate the  development of Irish-language education. However, I also need to be satisfied  that any proposal for a new school will lead to a viable establishment that  provides good-quality education for all pupils. On 11 October 2008, I launched  the review of Irish-medium education. I want extensive consultation across Ireland, North and South, and there will be  consultation in the four provinces: Connaught, Munster, Leinster and Ulster.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I will listen carefully to all the views expressed as part  of the consultation exercise and the decision-making process. I encourage all  those who are involved with Col&aacute;iste Speir&iacute;n, and others who want to provide  Irish-medium post primary, to consider the proposals in the report and to  decide where to go from here.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I considered the proposal for Col&aacute;iste Speir&iacute;n carefully. I  met, and listened to the views of, those involved. However, I was not convinced  that that particular proposal could achieve sustainable intakes. Col&aacute;iste  Speir&iacute;n enrolled six pupils in the 2007-08 school year, and attracted three new  pupils in the 2008-09 intake. Those figures fall far short of those required in  order to qualify for recurrent funding. I was also not satisfied that the  proposed funding arrangements with Col&aacute;iste Feirste would represent a good way  forward to deliver Irish-medium post-primary provision in the area, given that  Col&aacute;iste Feirste is 45 miles away.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I recognise the demand from parents in the mid-Ulster area  to have post-primary Irish-medium education. The Irish-medium education report  includes recommendations for the development of sustainable post-primary  provision, and I am in close contact with Comhairle na Gaelscola&iacute;ochta &mdash; one of  the bodies tasked with developing that, and Iontaobhas na Gaelscola&iacute;ochta.  Other interested stakeholders are examining jointly how a strategic approach  should best be progressed, and I will keep the House updated on that matter.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Cuirim an-sp&eacute;is sa m&eacute;id at&aacute; le r&aacute; ag an Aire. Cuirim f&aacute;ilte fosta roimh na  cuairteoir&iacute; &oacute;n Oireachtas.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome Members of the Oireachtas. It is important that  they are with us today, because the Minister referred to all-island elements of  forbairt na Gaeilge. Does the Minister realise that the unit in St Catherine&rsquo;s  College in Ard Mhacha was granted unit status with 10 pupils in 2002 &mdash; only one  more pupil than Col&aacute;iste Speir&iacute;n at An Chorr Chr&iacute;ochach.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Col&aacute;iste Chaitr&iacute;ona was a unit of St Catherine&rsquo;s, and it was in  the same building. Yes; it started with 10 pupils, and it has grown to be a  very successful and oversubscribed post-primary school.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Col&aacute;iste Chaitr&iacute;ona, the Irish-medium unit attached to St  Catherine&rsquo;s in Armagh, is the closest  alternative for families in the Cookstown area, as the Member will know.  Looking to the longer term, the report on Irish-medium post-primary provision  will lead to a sustainable solution for post-primary Irish-medium education to  serve pupils in each of the Six Counties &mdash; and that is what the Department of  Education is currently examining.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department is examining how to provide post-primary  education to children who leave rang a seacht &mdash; P7 &mdash; in order to adhere to the  entitlement framework and bring about collaboration, good practice and support  among Irish-medium schools. A network of post-primary schools is needed  throughout the North. At present, provision is limited to Col&aacute;iste Feirste in Belfast and Col&aacute;iste Chaitr&iacute;ona in Armagh.  Therefore, gaps in provision exist. That is what the Department works towards  at present to correct. Mr McGlone and, indeed, all Members, will see increasing  support for Irish language in the near future.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  I am pinching myself, because I almost welcome the Minister&rsquo;s decision. Any  decision from her is certainly a welcome development. A &lsquo;Belfast Telegraph&rsquo;  reporter claimed that the Minister is a greater threat to Irish than the entire  English language. Given that the Irish language has been the single biggest  battleground in Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s policy of decolonialisation, and is the reason why  it has become politicised and a divisive issue in society, has the Minister not  got the slightest flicker of recognition, or dawning realisation, that she and  her party colleagues carry the greatest guilt for that and that they have  greatest responsibility to end the language&rsquo;s politicisation?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Minister can choose whether she wants to answer that question.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I thank the Member for his support, and I look forward to it  when I inform the House about my future decisions on post-primary provision in  the North of Ireland. I will introduce proposals on the development of  post-primary education. In the light of the Assembly&rsquo;s statutory duty on  Irish-medium education, I look forward to the support of the party opposite.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not agree with the second part of the Member&rsquo;s  comments. As a parent, I have never politicised the Irish language. Thousands  of parents throughout the North of Ireland do not choose the school to which to  send their children because it might annoy my unionist colleagues. That is not  the way in which parents make choices for their children. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. The Minister has the Floor.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Parents make choices by asking what type of education is best  for their children. Whether people like or accept it, thousands of parents  throughout the North of Ireland choose to send their children to Irish-medium  schools. I support their choice and their right to make it. Parents make the  same choices when they decide whether to send their children to integrated  schools, Catholic schools, controlled schools, and so on. The least that the  Assembly can do is to respect parents&rsquo; right to choose the type of education  that they want for their children. I am glad to see that Basil McCrea agrees  with me. Obviously, the matter must be based on equality.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. In the light of the fact that  increasing numbers of children are being educated in the primary sector through  the medium of Irish, what can the Minister tell parents of pupils in my  constituency of Mid Ulster who want their children to avail themselves of Irish-medium  post-primary provision?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Go raibh maith agat as an cheist sin. I thank the Member for her  question. Many young people reach rang a seacht &mdash; P7 &mdash; only to learn that there  is no Irish-medium post-primary provision for them, not only in Mid Ulster, but  throughout the North of Ireland. That situation must be remedied. I intend to  do so through sustainable, strategic planning for the number of children that  is required for post-primary provision. Some Members played around with figures  and said that certain schools were started with a particular number of  children. There is a big difference between starting a primary school and  starting a post-primary school.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Members are aware that there is an entitlement framework in  the North. A broad curriculum is also in place. Sustainable, strategic  development of Irish-medium education is needed throughout the Six Counties.</p>
		    <p class="H5StageHeading">North/South Educational Exchanges</p>
		    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">2. <strong>Mr  Attwood </strong>asked the Minister of Education to outline the main findings of the  review of North/South educational exchanges; and how she intends to proceed  with this.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO700/09>(AQO 700/09)</a></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: North/South co-operation in education is top of my agenda. I am  particularly committed to ensuring that young people, youth workers and  teachers throughout the island get the opportunity to participate in exchanges  that will strengthen and develop organisational relationships and partnerships  and that will increase cross-border understanding.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I work very closely with the former Minister for Education  and Science in the South of Ireland, Mary Hanafin, and with the new Minister  for Education and Science, Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe. I have attended a number of  cross-border events, among them the development of North/South co-operation in  relation to underachieve&shy;ment and the OECD; an annual national conference in  Limerick concerning Irish-medium education; the launch of a North/South  together tool kit for ethnic minority children, which went to every primary  school across the island; the launch of a lift-off programme, which is a human  rights programme between various teacher unions North and South; and many other  conferences and events. I believe that together, North and South, we can work  to provide the best quality education for children.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In April 2002, the North/South Ministerial Council endorsed  a structure comprising a programme manage&shy;ment committee, a standing advisory  committee and a joint delivery agency. The two Education Departments were asked  to give effect to the proposed structure and to determine the appropriate legal  framework. The two Departments worked toward the establishment of structures to  facilitate policy development and to support and co-ordinate this diverse field  of activity.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">With the restoration of the North/South Ministerial Council  in May 2007, the Departments felt that, given the time that had passed, it was  essential to review the approach to facilitating and managing North/South  exchanges. The Departments remained committed to North/South exchanges as a  means of contributing to the fostering of mutual understanding, and to working  for opportunities of mutual benefit. It was their view that the arrangements  deemed appropriate before the suspension of the institutions in 2002 should be  considered again in the markedly changing context. In December 2007, the  Departments commissioned a review of North/South co-operation, which was  carried out jointly, with a view to identifying a range of options for future  progress.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am extremely grateful to the many people on the ground  who have made, and will continue to make, those exchanges happen. I pay tribute  to those who have worked so hard to encourage and facilitate exchanges, and I  know that many of those people have had the opportunity to feed into the  review. The key finding of the review is that the circumstances and timing are  appropriate for the two Departments to have a coherent and conjoined policy  approach, and I look forward to that.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I have received the report from the review team, along with  the recommendations from my officials, which I am considering. I will be  meeting with my colleague from the South, Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, and we will jointly  discuss and agree the next steps, after we have had the opportunity to consider  the report.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I thank the Minister, and acknowledge that she said that cross-border education  is top of her agenda. Does she share the concern that six years ago, policies  were agreed between Governments in respect of a programme management committee,  a standing advisory committee and a joint delivery agency, and six years later,  following the review that she commissioned, the height of what has been  proposed is, as she said one minute ago: &ldquo;a coherent and conjoined policy  approach&rdquo;?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Is that not just more meaningless words? What has  happened to the good hard proposals that were on the table and agreed six years  ago?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I make no apology for wanting to make North/South proposals, and  working together, a part of the policy between the two Departments. It worries  me that the Member appears to think that we should not put North/South  exchanges at the core of everything that the Department does.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCausland</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her answer. She has told us that North/South exchanges  are at the top of her agenda, but where do east-west exchanges stand on that  agenda? Will she detail what she has done to facilitate east-west exchanges,  especially as Northern Ireland  is closer to Galloway in Scotland  than it is to Galway in the Irish   Republic?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: I have always viewed British/Irish relations as very important.  Anyone who looks at the work that I have done to build links, on a range of  issues, with England, Scotland and Wales, will understand how  important building those relationships is.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am thankful that we are building a different type of  relationship with our neighbouring island to the one we had for centuries and,  fortunately, it is based on equality and partnership arrangements.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As the Members sitting opposite know, I value highly  working with our Celtic cousins in Scotland, and they lead the way on  many educational issues. Members will be glad to hear that we learn from them  on a range of issues, such as Scots Gaelic, the post-primary system,  underachievement, and so forth. People will be aware that I travelled to Scotland to  meet my colleague there.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I also attended a British-Irish meeting at Stormont and an  excellent meeting in Dublin.  It was good to meet our cousins from different areas, such as the Isle of Man.  Members can, therefore, see the importance that I place on British-Irish  relations. We have much to learn from England,  Scotland and Wales, and from  the islands that surround both our islands.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burnside</strong>:  I will not ask my question in Gaelic today because I do not want to offend our  friends from the D&aacute;il. They are used to listening to the proceedings there &mdash;  where English is normally spoken.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. Will the Member please ask his question?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burnside</strong>:  It concerns me that the Minister puts North/South dialogue at the top of her  agenda. Is it not more important to put the priorities and needs of education  in Northern Ireland  at the top of her agenda? Why does she not examine the fact that Northern Ireland  has state, voluntary, integrated and Irish-medium systems of education? If she  compares North with South, and East with West, she will discover more forms of  education here than in any other part of the British Isles.  A few additional priorities exist, such as the selection procedure between  primary and secondary education. It concerns me greatly that the Minister has  the wrong subject at the top of her agenda.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: The Member knows that, since I took up office, I have done a  huge amount of work to increase equality in the education system. He will also  know that every year 12,000 young people leave the system without attaining  GCSEs in English and maths. No one in the House wants his or her child to leave  school without those qualifications. Therefore, I placed dealing with  underachievement and increasing equality at the top of my agenda. One good way  to go about that is to learn from what works well in the South, and the  Department is also learning form England,  Scotland and Wales.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I would welcome a contribution from the Member on how to  deal with the 47% of children who leave school every year having been failed by  the system. If the parties on the other side of the Chamber want to sit on  their hands and do nothing about that, that is up to them, but I am not  prepared to preside over education apartheid in the North of Ireland. That is  why I introduced proposals to make changes to ensure that all children have  opportunities. For too long, too many children were failed. That must stop; children  will not be failed on my watch.</p>
		    <p class="H5StageHeading">Review of Public Administration</p>
		    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">3. <strong>Mr  Boylan </strong>asked the Minister of Education what meetings she has had with the  (i) Chief Executives; and (ii) Chairpersons, of the Education and Library  Boards in relation to the Review of Public Administration.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO786/09> (AQO 786/09)</a></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Bh&iacute; cuid mh&oacute;r d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireachta&iacute; agam le cathaoirligh na mbord  oideachais agus leabharlainne ar na mallaibh. T&aacute; m&eacute; i mo chathaoirleach ar  fh&oacute;ram chathaoirligh an RPA, a thig le ch&eacute;ile go rialta. Go dt&iacute; seo, eagra&iacute;odh  na cruinnithe seo i mB&eacute;al Feirste, in Ard Mhacha, san I&uacute;r, ar an &Oacute;maigh, i  nDoire agus in Aontroim.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Recently, I had numerous discussions with the chairpersons  of the education and library boards, and I chair the RPA chairpersons&rsquo; forum  that meets regularly. To date, meetings have been held in Belfast,  Armagh, Newry, Omagh, Derry and Antrim. The  forum gives the chairpersons of all organisations that are affected by RPA an  opportunity to engage with me, and I brief them on RPA developments. We discuss  the best way of engaging the organisations that are involved, and we jointly  examine the issues to be faced in maintaining service continuity during the  period of transition.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The RPA chairpersons&rsquo; forum invites to its meetings: the  chairpersons of the five education and library boards; the Council for  Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment; the CCMS, the Youth Council; Comhairle  na Gaelscola&iacute;ochta; the Council for Integrated Education, and the Staff  Commission for Education and Library Boards.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, representatives of the General Teaching  Council are welcome to attend. If the chairperson of that organisation cannot  attend a meeting, the vice-chairperson can attend instead. I am delighted that  so many busy people have attended those important meetings, and I will chair  forums regularly in the coming months.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Given the important issues under discussion, I am  disappointed that one education and library board has attended one meeting  only. All other boards have attended the majority of meetings.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>: I  thank the Minister for her response. What level of engagement have her senior  officials had with education stakeholders on RPA in education?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: In addition to measures outlined in my previous response, my  officials conduct regular discussions on RPA with stakeholders. Those  discussions will continue in the coming months. For example, the Department&rsquo;s  permanent secretary, Will Haire, and other senior officials meet regularly with  the chief executives of the education and library boards. Furthermore, I have  met with them on several occasions.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Senior departmental officials and the ESA imple&shy;mentation  team meet regularly with key education-sector officials and trade unions. In  May and June, the ESA implementation team held 20 workshops, which involved 350  managers in the sector. Moreover, four workshops were held to hear the views of  a cross section of primary and post-primary principals on how the ESA can  deliver better services to schools. Positive engage&shy;ment with staff in the  education organisations is ongoing.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  Will the Minister confirm what meetings she has had with the chairperson of the  South Eastern Education and Library Board? It seems that such meetings are  impossible because, despite repeated promises, she has not reinstalled that  board. The direct rule administration people are still there at a cost of &pound;500  a day. Will the Minister confirm that she will bring back the South Eastern  Education and Library Board and reinstall public accountability to education in  that area given that she has not held any meetings there?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Go raibh maith agat as an cheist sin. The South Eastern  Education and Library Board is a member of the RPA chairperson&rsquo;s forum, and it  always sends representatives to meetings. I have met with the chairperson of  the South Eastern Education and Library Board. As the Member will be aware, I  met with the political representatives and the non-political &mdash; appointed &mdash;  representatives of the board. Members will know that there were difficulties  with governance and financial accountability, and I have held discussions aimed  at making sure that political representatives and laypeople understand their  governance and accountability responsibilities, and my officials are working  with representatives of the board. As the Member knows, I will be introducing  proposals in due course.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  What discussions has the Minister had with the education boards &mdash; and,  specifically, the transferor representatives in that section &mdash; so that they  will not be discriminated against?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: As I have said in the House repeatedly, I will ensure that all  sectors are treated fairly. My intention is that the second RPA Bill will  include provisions to reform and simplify the composition of boards of  governors of grant-aided schools. I recognise the important contribution made  by transferors, and my officials and I have had discussions with that group. It  was never anyone&rsquo;s intention to discriminate against any sectoral groups,  including transferors who play an important role in education.</p>
		    <p class="H5StageHeading">Post-Primary Transfer Process</p>
		    <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">4. <strong>Mr B  McCrea </strong>asked the Minister of Education what advice her Department is  providing to teachers and parents of pupils currently in primary 6, in relation  to the post-primary transfer process they will face.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO726/09> (AQO 726/09)</a></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Thank you, Basil.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">T&aacute; freagra tugtha agam ar an cheist seo ar roinnt &oacute;c&aacute;id&iacute;,  agus t&aacute; an freagra f&oacute;s mar an gc&eacute;anna. T&aacute; m&eacute; ag brath ar ghairmi&uacute;lacht na  bpr&iacute;omhoid&iacute; agus na m&uacute;inteoir&iacute; chun an curaclam athbhreithnithe a theagasc, n&oacute;  is &eacute; sin go d&iacute;reach at&aacute; de dh&iacute;th chun p&aacute;ist&iacute; a ullmh&uacute; do na socruithe at&aacute; &aacute;  moladh agam le haghaidh aistri&uacute; iarbhunscoile. Is ceart mar sin do mo  chomhghleacaithe sa Choiste Feidhmi&uacute;ch&aacute;in breithni&uacute; d&aacute;ir&iacute;re a dh&eacute;anamh orthu.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As the Member will be aware, I have answered this question  on a number of occasions, and my answer remains the same. I look to the  professionalism of principals and teachers to deliver the revised curriculum,  for that is precisely what is required to prepare children for the post-primary  transfer arrangements that I propose. Those proposed arrangements merit serious  consideration by my colleagues in the Executive.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Department has just issued 350,000 leaflets &mdash; in Irish  to Irish-speaking schools and in English to schools that teach through the  medium of English. Those leaflets provide details of the revised curriculum,  and they will go to every parent who has a child in the primary or post-primary  sector.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Thank you very much, Caitr&iacute;ona. The issue is about choice. Earlier, in answer  to Mr McGlone&rsquo;s question, I heard the Minister talking about parents making  choices about integrated, Irish-medium or other schools. Will she not agree  that it is important that parents and their children have a choice about the  school that the children go to &mdash; be that a grammar school; a high school; the  school that is next to them; or a specialist school? Will she give some  indication to the thousands upon thousands of parents with children in P6 as to  what their children should do to prepare for the next phase of their education?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Parents should have choice, but within a framework of equality.  The current system is not equal because it divides children on the basis of two  one-hour tests for which parents who can afford it can coach their children.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Choice must be based on equality because there is equality  legislation in the North of Ireland. If we are serious about dealing with the  significant body of underachievement in our system, we have to create a fair  one, and that is what I am going to do. In relation to the parents of P6  children, the Department has produced a leaflet that contains information on  the revised curriculum. I also wrote to every single principal regarding the  revised curriculum in June 2008.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Teachers are professional &mdash; they know what they want to  teach, and they know that there has been a distortion of the primary  curriculum. This year&rsquo;s 11-plus will be the last. Under the compromise  proposals that I have brought forward, the test will no longer be sat in  primary schools. There will be a three-year phased ending to academic  selection.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Teachers and parents of P6 children need to know that the  revised curriculum is a good one. Teachers like it and it stimulates our young  people. Furthermore, no longer does it divide our young people and create an  elitist education system in which some children can go to certain schools  because of where they live, or because their parents have more money than  parents of other children. Statistics indicate that 19% of secondary schools  provide free school meals, but only 7% of grammar schools do.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Many grammar schools understand the need for change, which  I welcome. I have had dinners with post-primary school principals right across  the North. I have another one tomorrow night in Derry.  I was in Ballymena last week and Limavady the week before that. I was also in  Newry, Downpatrick and all different parts of the North. I will continue to do  that because educationalists know what is, and what is not, good for our  children. High-stake tests at 11 years of age, for which children can be  coached, are not the way forward.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  At least we now know that the Minister of Education has moved on from the idea  of using a postcode lottery to place a child in a post-primary school based on  where he or she lives, to a system based on where a child eats. She is now  going to use &mdash;</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member must ask a question. The time for questions to the  Minister of Education is almost up.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  She is now the dinner lady of the education service instead of being the  Education Minister. Will the Minister reveal what amendments she has made to  her proposals, as she knows that there is no political consensus on them as  they currently stand? What amendments has she made to her proposals to make  them acceptable, so that the Executive might be able to agree them? Although I  have to wonder if there will ever be an Executive meeting, owing to the failure  of Sinn F&eacute;in.</p>
	        <p class="TimePeriod">3.00 pm</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Time is up for Questions to the Minister of Education &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span> Perhaps, the Minister will give a short  answer.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  In English.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education</strong>: Is f&eacute;idir liom an teanga a phiocadh. I can choose which language  I speak. I may even answer in Spanish.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the Member&rsquo;s belated concern about the postcode lottery.  I have listened to Members talking about that, and, no matter how admissions  criteria are introduced &mdash; preferably through the Executive &mdash; I will introduce  criteria for socially disadvantaged children. I look forward to the support of  all Members who have spoken to me about a postcode lottery, because I wish to  ensure that the inequality in the system is eliminated, so that working-class  children will cease to be disadvantaged.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Member will know that, on 15 May, I brought proposals  to the Executive, but the Executive refused to discuss them. I want to present  proposals to the Executive. However, all parties must understand that if the  Executive &mdash; a North/South, British-Irish power-sharing arrangement &mdash; are to  work together, they must act on the basis of equality and partnership.</p>

	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Question 1 has been withdrawn.</p>
	        <p class="H5StageHeading">US Visit</p>
	        <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">2. <strong>Mr  Gardiner </strong>asked the Minister for Employment and Learning what outcomes were  achieved following his recent visit to the United States.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO738/09>(AQO 738/09)</a></p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning (Sir Reg Empey)</strong>: During my visit, I spoke to many  business people about opportunities for further collaboration between Northern Ireland education establishments and  their equivalents in the United    States. In addition, I met the vice  president of the National Centre for Technological Literacy, Yvonne Spicer, and  her team from the Museum of Science in Boston.  They have developed and pioneered teaching programmes for science, technology,  engineering and mathematics (STEM) subjects throughout all 50 states.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Museum of Science offered to share its teaching materials and  experience with Northern Ireland,  and I will discuss that initiative with the Minister of Education in the  context of our review of STEM-subject provision in Northern Ireland.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  In the Minister&rsquo;s discussions with the Americans, did the subjects of the  Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act 2008, or new GI Bill, come up?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: Yes, they did come up. I met Ms Molly Corbett  Broad, president of the American Council on Education &mdash; the organisation that  represents the university system in the United States. In addition, I met  Senator Jim Webb from Virginia,  who was the author of the new GI Bill. Both conversations impressed greatly on  me the role that education and skills &mdash; particularly higher-level skills &mdash; can  play in reintegrating former military personnel into civilian society and in  developing a vibrant economy.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, I was impressed by the level of investment  that the United States Government are making in those who have returned from  military service in order to ensure that they have an opportunity to re-skill  and up-skill, and so make the fullest possible contribution to their national  economy.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Newton</strong>:  During his visit to the United    States, did the Minster gain an  understanding of the relationship between the education system and the business  community? Did he learn anything from observing that relationship, and is there  anything that might be brought back to enhance the Northern Ireland education system,  particularly in the area of vocational skills?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: Yes. I visited an organisation called CARE that is  sponsored by the private sector. CARE is a Peace-Corps-type operation, in which  people spend time particularly with children from disadvantaged communities.  That organisation is predominately sponsored by the private sector and local  states. Furthermore, in the United    States, there is much greater collaboration  between the business and education sectors than there is here.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">We should try to encourage that. The business community  realises the significance of engaging, at an earlier stage, with elements of  the education sector in securing the long-term provision of labour supply.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, as a result of changing demographics in the United States, that country is in a tougher  position than Northern    Ireland in relation to essential skills. A  large proportion of the workforce &mdash; some 39 million people &mdash; do not have  fundamental, essential skills. That figure is growing, which is one reason that  the GI Bill was introduced in order to ensure that that section of the  community achieves the necessary level of skills.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Given what the Minister has said,  will he confirm that any proposed investment to help to reduce unemployment &mdash;  particularly for those with essential skills problems &mdash; will be targeted  specifically at areas of multiple deprivation?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: There is a strong link between educational  underachieve&shy;ment and areas of significant deprivation. We need only look  around our own Province for evidence of that. The two issues are undoubtedly  related, so the solutions must also be related.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Sadly, in areas that are deemed to be more affluent, there  are pockets in which the same problems arise. Unfortunately, the criteria that  were used &mdash; such as the Noble indices &mdash; were blunt instruments, which excluded  pockets in which individuals had learning difficulties. The improvement of  essential skills must be open to all, irrespective of geographical area. There  is a link &mdash; albeit not 100% &mdash; and areas of social and economic deprivation have  more educational underachievement than other areas.</p>
	        <p class="H5StageHeading">Practical Works within the Community</p>
	        <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">3. <strong>Mr  Shannon </strong>asked the Minister for Employment and Learning what consideration  he has given to implementing a module on practical works within the community  for courses delivered by further education colleges on providing public  services, similar to the practical work in the community carried out by the  Prince&rsquo;s Trust.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO744/09> (AQO 744/09)</a></p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: The Prince&rsquo;s Trust team programme, which involves  participants undertaking a community project as part of the course, is  currently delivered in all six further education colleges. Colleges provide the  training element of the programme, which is funded by my Department.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The further education (FE) colleges are responsible for  setting their own course provision for implementing a module on practical works  within the community, including the practical work.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his response. To those Members who are aware of the  Prince&rsquo;s Trust, it is obvious that it carries out marvellous work and provides  opportunities to young boys and girls who particularly need help. I had hoped  that the Minister would provide an assurance that further work in the Prince&rsquo;s  Trust will be unfolded in all FE colleges and that courses currently being  undertaken could be developed to involve more young people.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I have made it my business to meet representatives  of the Prince&rsquo;s Trust. I have attended four events and have examined its work.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Prince&rsquo;s Trust team programme is provided with a range  of delivery partners, including the FE colleges. The programme has been  designed by the Prince&rsquo;s Trust to target hard-to-reach, socially excluded and  marginalised young people between the ages 16 and 25. Some of the programmes  are quite expensive, but they are exceptional, which is why I support them.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">As the Member will be aware, the training component of the  team programme is, typically, delivered by the FE colleges, and the cost is met  from the recurrent funding that is allocated to the colleges by my Department.  The team programme has been running since 2006, and feedback has been positive.  The colleges have indicated that over 84% of the participants who complete the  programme progress into further study, training or employment. Therefore, I can  give the Member the assurance that he seeks.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Butler</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Ba mhaith liom bu&iacute;ochas a  thabhairt don Aire as an fhreagra sin.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Does the Minister agree that, although courses delivered by  the colleges and the Prince&rsquo;s Trust are beneficial to the community, attention  should be focused on the delivery of courses that provide qualifications for  high-value, knowledge-based jobs for those who are involved in those types of  activities? If we are to compete in the economy, does the Minister agree that  his emphasis and focus should be on the delivery of high-value jobs, so that we  are not vulnerable to people from other countries taking our jobs? That is particularly  pertinent in the current economic climate. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: I understand what the Member says. However, much  as I would like to focus on the high-value-added jobs that he refers to, many  people in large swathes of our community &mdash; including the Member&rsquo;s constituency,  as he will know &mdash; are not yet at the stage where they can benefit from, and  exploit, some of the higher-value-added qualifications.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">We must take a twin-track approach to the issue. On the one  hand &mdash; and considering the current circumstances &mdash; we must concentrate on the  skills that are relevant to the knowledge-based economy into which we are  moving. That requires investment, not only in the higher grades of vocational  training, but right through the higher-education sector. Alongside that, a  large swathe of our population does not have basic essential skills. Pertinent  to that, and to Mr Shannon&rsquo;s question, is that the Prince&rsquo;s Trust concentrates  on reaching those harder-to-get-at clients &mdash; as do other community-based  organisations.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The process, therefore, must be twin-tracked; we must go  after both groups of people, because those without the essential skills cannot  be progressed into the more productive end of the economy &mdash; and the areas in which  there is more potential &mdash; if they do not have the basic qualifications. In  2020, it is estimated that only 2% of the available jobs will be unskilled  compared to the current figure of 17&middot;5%. The Member will see that we have a  long way to go.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his comprehensive answers; he has almost blown away my  questions in his replies to previous questions. How can the Department for  Employment and Learning and the Prince&rsquo;s Trust work together to expand the  programme further to try and reach the individuals whom he mentioned in his  response to the previous supplementary question &mdash; the young people on the  fringes, who require to be brought in?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: The Prince&rsquo;s Trust, in common with several voluntary  organisations, specialises in a harder-to-reach client. It is therefore not  unique in that; however, we have looked at one or two of the courses that the  Prince&rsquo;s Trust runs, and, although the cost per client is higher &mdash;  significantly so in one case &mdash; we must take whatever steps are necessary if we  are to stop people from falling behind. I, therefore, support, unashamedly,  what the Prince&rsquo;s Trust does, although I acknowledge that it is not the only  organisation that follows such a path.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">As Members know, there are particular clients who, simply,  will not turn up at a college of further education. One has to go to the doors  of those people, and they have to gain some confidence, because, perhaps, they  suffer from a lack of self-esteem. All of that costs money, but it is  fundamental to our attempt to improve our community and to bring as many people  as possible into our society to make them economically active and productive.  It is expensive, but it is money well spent.</p>
	        <p class="H5StageHeading">New Deal: Derry/Londonderry</p>
	        <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">4. <strong>Mr McCartney </strong>asked the Minister for Employment and Learning to outline the tendering  criteria which informed the decision to award the tender to operate the New  Deal Programme in Derry/Londonderry to A4e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO790/09> (AQO  790/09)</a></p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: The contract for Steps to Work in the Foyle  contract area has not been awarded. The procurement process is ongoing. All  tenders for the Steps to Work programme were assessed against the criteria of  methodology, relevant experience and capacity to deliver, and broken into  sub-criteria.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCartney</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Ba mhaith liom mo bhu&iacute;ochas a  thabhairt don Aire as an fhreagra sin.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister outline why it was necessary to rerun the  tendering process after A4e was awarded preferred-bidder status?</p>
	        <p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for Employment and Learning</strong><strong>:</strong> The Member must bear in mind that the process is  ongoing and, while that is the case, I must be careful about what I say. The  procurement process has not been concluded in two remaining areas. New bids  have been received for the Foyle area and those will be assessed shortly, and  further information has been received for the north-west. However, the process  is ongoing in the Foyle area, and I am unable to say anything further.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>: I  understand the constraints that the Minister has referred to. However, on the  wider aspect of the Steps to Work programme, the Minister must be aware that  many people believe that the Central Procurement Directorate appears to be  acting to some sort of imperative to ensure that outside players are  successfully brought into the market. Rightly or wrongly, that is the  impression that people have.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">How far are the decisions on methodology, relevant  experience and capacity to deliver taken by his Department, and how far are  they taken by the Central Procurement Directorate, which may have little  experience in that area?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for Employment and Learning</strong><strong>: </strong> I understand through correspondence and other contacts that  the Member has a keen interest in the matter. The Central Procurement  Directorate is not attempting to ensure that outside people are brought in.  Having agreed the terms of reference for the contracts with my Department, the  Central Procurement Directorate must implement those terms of reference and  assess the bids that have been made. If that results in someone who is not  based here being awarded a contract, that is within European Union rules and  regulations. There is no predisposition to ensure that someone from outside is  awarded a contract, any more than there is a predisposition to award a contract  to a local firm. If the process is to be fair and open, it must be based on  objective criteria, which is why we hand over the process to the Central  Procurement Directorate (CPD), which has the expertise to deal with the  situation.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Department&rsquo;s role is, primarily, to set out what is  required. As a former Minister of Finance and Personnel, the Member knows that  the CPD&rsquo;s role is to ensure that proper and due process is followed correctly.</p>
	        <p class="H5StageHeading">National Minimum Wage</p>
	        <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">5. <strong>Mr Cree </strong>asked  the Minister for Employment and Learning what input he provided to the recent  Low Pay Commission Review of the National Minimum Wage.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO737/09> (AQO 737/09)</a></p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for Employment and Learning</strong>: In  addition to providing a contribution to the co-ordinated Northern Ireland  submission to the chairman of the Low Pay Commission, I wrote to him on 1  October drawing attention to the position of apprentices who currently have no  minimum wage. Anecdotal evidence suggests that, in some cases, the wages earned  are insufficient to cover the basic cost of living and, if that continues, it  will lead to a decrease in the number of apprenticeships being completed, which  will have a detrimental impact on the economy. I have recommended, therefore,  that the Low Pay Commission gives consideration to a minimum rate of pay for  all apprentices in Northern Ireland  and that that should be in line with what is required in England.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his comforting reply. However, do apprentices in other  parts of the UK  earn different remuneration?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for Employment and Learning</strong>: Obviously,  there is a difference between here and Great Britain because, as I said,  there is no minimum wage here. However, as I understand it, an apprentice can  earn a minimum of &pound;80 a week in England.  The difficulty is that people believe that apprentices are not given a  reasonable basic minimum wage level. Several Members have referred to that  fact, and it has also been raised in debates. Due to the circumstances of  apprenticeships, it is outside the current normal regulations. In England, the  current minimum rate of pay is &pound;80 a week. However, from 2009, that figure will  increase to &pound;95 a week.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Under those circumstances, I was right to contact the Low  Pay Commission &mdash; and I said in previous debates that I would do so. There was a  consensus in the House that it was unsatisfactory for apprentices to be left in  that position. I hope that the commission&rsquo;s response will be positive. I  appreciate that we do not wish to burden businesses any more than is necessary;  however, we must balance that concern with concerns about the ability to  attract people to undertake apprenticeships that offer them very little money  on which to live.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Irwin</strong>:  What is the Minister&rsquo;s view on the Low Pay Commission&rsquo;s recommendation that  21-year-olds should be entitled to the adult rate of the national minimum wage?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: That is one of the issues that I look forward to  the Low Pay Commission addressing. At the moment, there is no guidance &mdash; wages  are a matter for the apprentice and the employer to work out between them.  However, that arrangement has led to some young people receiving very small  amounts of money that are inadequate to live on. We accept that being an  apprentice is different from being a fully qualified employee. However, I am  content to wait for the commission&rsquo;s recommendations, and I intend to bring  details of them to the House when they are published, as Members have expressed  an interest in the matter in recent debates.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>:  It is comforting to hear the Minister talk about the construction industry,  given the sorry mess that it is in. Can he tell us why a policy on the minimum  wage has been so slow to emerge? Furthermore, how many apprentices are there in  the construction industry, and what is being done to encourage young people to  continue to express an interest in that important industry?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: The Member&rsquo;s last question is about a subject that  is different from the subject of the main question. However, that has never  stopped the Member asking such a question in the past, and, no doubt, it will  not stand in his way in the future.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">All joking aside, the situation is very serious. Large  numbers of apprentices have lost their positions, and my Department is urgently  considering what it will do to address that matter. Many of those apprentices  are part of the way through their apprenticeships &mdash; they have gained only some  of the necessary qualifications and are now being put out of their posts. We  must decide what to do with those young people. The Department may have to  intervene. I am considering that option at the moment, and I will be happy to  bring my conclusion to the House in due course.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">How did we get into this position? It appears that a gap  has emerged. As Members know, the issue of low pay is dealt with nationally,  but apprenticeships seem to be one of the issues that have fallen through the  cracks. I do not know the legal or technical reasons for that, but I am happy  to send a letter to the Member to clarify the matter. However, when the problem  was brought to my attention, I acted to address it. I have put forward a  positive case &mdash; based, in part, on Members&rsquo; contributions to recent debates &mdash;  and I look forward to a positive outcome.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Department is examining concerns about the construction  industry as a matter of urgency, and I hope that we can present some proposals  before too long. However, any solution will be neither easy nor cheap.</p>
	        <p class="H5StageHeading">Teacher Education in a Climate of Change</p>
	        <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">6. <strong>Mr Ford </strong>asked  the Minister for Employment and Learning for an update on the progress of the  &lsquo;Teacher Education in a Climate of Change&rsquo; review, commissioned by his  Department and the Department of Education in April 2003.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO806/09> (AQO 806/09)</a></p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: Officials in my Department and in the Department  of Education are finalising a draft policy framework paper, which will be  submitted for consideration to the Minister of Education and me in the next few  weeks. The timescale for the completion of the review from that point onwards  will be determined by several factors, including consideration by the relevant  departmental Committees, other Ministers and the Executive.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  am grateful to the Minister for his answer, although the fact that the issue  depends on the Executive&rsquo;s taking action should not give us any grounds for  optimism at the moment. Over the past year or so, the Assembly has held several  debates on teacher training, and the number of teacher-training places is of  real concern. Given that, can the Minister tell us whether the long delay on this  matter has hampered his Department&rsquo;s ability to produce a strategic plan for  teacher education?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: The Member is correct that the delay in the  process has not been Government&rsquo;s finest hour. It had been hoped that the  review would be published shortly after a conference in 2005. However, that  coincided with announcements on the review of public administration and George Bain&rsquo;s  independent strategic review of education. Those significant policy issues and  matters relating to the funding model had to be reflected in the final  document.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The issue is cross-cutting and involves at least two &mdash;  probably three &mdash; Departments. The guidance is that Ministers cannot act  unilaterally in such matters. Therefore, I am required to agree with the  Minister of Education &mdash; and possibly other Ministers &mdash; to bring a proposal to  the Executive for it to be made Executive policy. That has not happened for  obvious reasons.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I assure the Member that I regularly raise the matter of  the review&rsquo;s completion with senior officials. We are acutely aware of the  concerns about initial teacher education. The delay is one of the worst that is  being experienced. It is not a pretty picture, and I and my Department want an  urgent conclusion. I read an earlier draft of the review some time ago, and it  contained some high-quality work. I hope that the Member will think the same  when it is eventually published.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>:  Will the Minister outline the level of co-operation on the review that he has  received from the Education Minister? What information has the Department of  Education shared with the Department for Employment and Learning to aid the  Minister&rsquo;s decisions on the new funding models for Stranmillis and St Mary&rsquo;s  university colleges?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: The teacher-education review that Mr Ford&rsquo;s  question referred to is a collaborative effort. We work closely with officials  from the Department of Education. The Minister of Education and I have  corresponded on matters pertaining to the report. We must agree the final  content, and we will.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Member will be aware that the number of initial  teacher-education training places is determined by the Minister of Education. I  determine the number of non-teacher-education courses that are delivered in  colleges. My Department also provides resources for colleges to operate on both  initial teacher-education places and non-initial teacher-education places. The Department  of Education usually gives me an indication of those numbers in January of each  year. When I receive that indication, I will bring it to the House&rsquo;s attention.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I agree that this is not the Government&rsquo;s finest hour. Indeed, it is a sorry  state of affairs that &mdash; for four years before Mr Empey became a Minister, and  for 18 months since &mdash; two Government Departments have not been able to complete  the review.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Is there not a tension between the Minister&rsquo;s assertion  that he and the Department of Education cannot act unilaterally on a review of  teacher training, and the fact that Stranmillis   University College  and Queen&rsquo;s University acted unilaterally and tried to bounce the rest of us  into agreeing to the merger proposal?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: That was very well done &mdash; the Member for East Londonderry will have to try harder. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Attwood knows that when it comes to a cross-cutting  issue, it is desirable for the Departments concerned to work together and reach  a conclusion. It is also desirable that those conclusions be made Executive  policy, so that it becomes a Government-wide issue; otherwise, people head off  on tangents.</p>
	        <p class="TimePeriod">3.30 pm</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">To answer the Member&rsquo;s second point, Stranmillis University   College and Queen&rsquo;s  University can come together, but that does not constitute a decision on their  part. They can make a recommendation, but it is up to the House to determine  the outcome.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Queen&rsquo;s University and Stranmillis University   College have promised me  an economic appraisal that will be to the Treasury&rsquo;s green book standards. I  was due to receive that at the end of July 2008, but I am yet to receive it.  When I receive it, I will have to study it, as will the Department of Finance  and Personnel. If, on reaching a conclusion, we feel minded to go along with  the proposal, a Bill will be prepared. That Bill will be subject to the full  legislative process of the House. As I have said many times, I have no plans or  intention for that Bill to proceed by accelerated passage.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Question 7 and question 8 have been withdrawn.</p>

	        <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">9. <strong>Mr  McCarthy </strong>asked the Minister for Employment and Learning what plans there  are to accommodate the continuity of community education without the burden of  accreditation and additional costs associated with Further Education Colleges.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO801/09> (AQO 801/09)</a></p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Employment and Learning</strong>: My Department&rsquo;s priority is to encourage learners  to follow courses that lead to qualifications that are accredited on the  national qualifications framework. Such provision meets stringent quality  criteria, the needs of employers and learners, and is recognised by employers  and educational establishments at home and abroad, thereby enabling learners&rsquo;  progression. However, I recognise that courses that are not on the national  qualifications framework meet the needs of some learners; for example, some  older learners and some people with learning difficulties or disabilities.  Therefore, I confirm that around 5% of college provision that my Department  funds will go on courses that are not on the national qualifications framework.</p>

	        <p class="H4StageHeading">Renewable Emergy/PPS 18</p>
	        <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">1. <strong>Mr McKay </strong>asked the Minister of Enterprise,  Trade and Investment if she has met with the Minister of the Environment to  discuss renewable energy and PPS 18.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO764/09> (AQO  764/09)</a></p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment (Mrs Foster)</strong>: On 23 September, the Minister of the Environment  and I met to discuss those matters. As the Member knows, renewable-energy  development is a highly important objective for my Department, and for Northern Ireland  as a whole, if we are to reduce our exposure to the supply uncertainties and  price volatility that are associated with the current energy market. In that  regard, planning policy statement (PPS) 18 is helpful in reducing barriers to  the development of renewable energy by adopting a presumption in favour of wind  generation.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Our meeting particularly focused on the proposed  supplementary guidance to PPS 18, which is intended to ensure that adequate  protection be given to our valuable landscape through the appropriate siting of  wind turbines. As with so many such considerations, it will be important to  strike a balance between security and sustainability of our energy supply with  affordability and environmental protection.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McKay</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for her answer.  Does she believe that energy policy, either through the Department of the  Environment or the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment, should  accommodate and promote local community and domestically based energy provision  more than a larger, centralised model of energy provision?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: We want all those types of energy provision. My Department has  promoted domestic energy, but we also know that, in order to meet our European  Union targets, a step change is needed on renewable energy. Therefore, we are  firmly considering new tidal renewable energy; we have initiated a strategic  environmental assessment on it. We are working with the wind industry to determine  what more can be done with that type of energy. We want everyone to play their  part when it comes to using renewable energy in future.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: The  Minister referred to a presumption in favour of wind energy under PPS 18, but  several people in the industry say that the supplementary guidance, of which  she may have had some knowledge in her previous occupation, provides a  presumption against wind energy in a large portion of Northern Ireland.  Has the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment taken any view on the  necessity of ensuring that wind energy is not developed merely in two or three  tiny areas but is available for the benefit of Northern Ireland on a wider  scale?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: I take it from that that the Member wants us to move outside of  Fermanagh and South Tyrone. I assure him that we will. On a more serious note,  PPS 18 has a presumption in favour of wind energy, but the Member is right to  say that there have been difficulties with the supplementary planning guidance.  I stress to him that, as its name suggests, that is guidance, not the planning  policy.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I am aware of ongoing discussions and negotiations within  the industry and between officials in my Department and their counterparts in  the Department of the Environment. The Member knows that turbine height appears  to be the biggest problem. The guidance has a specific remit in relation to  that issue. I want a degree of flexibility on turbine heights. I know that  those discussions are continuing and I hope that they will bear fruit.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  The Minister will be aware of a recent debate on climate change, and I assume  that she does not necessarily share the views of her colleague, the Minister of  the Environment. There was broad agreement across the Chamber that one of the  ways to encourage the use of renewable energy was to use grants as a carrot  approach, as well as using a stick. Will the Minister outline what incentives  her Department proposes to offer industries to encourage them to use renewable  energy?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment</strong>: The main way that  renewable energy is incentivised is through the Northern Ireland renewables  obligation: that will continue. Indeed, there will be a consultation about it  very soon. Scotland  is also considering the issue, and what it consults on must tie in with what we  do, in particular, in relation to tidal resources. It would be out of step for Scotland to offer more renewables obligation  certificates for tidal energy than Northern Ireland. It will be  important that there is joined-up Government between Northern   Ireland and Scotland in that regard.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Question 2 has been withdrawn.</p>
	        <p class="H5StageHeading">All-Ireland Economy</p>
	        <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">3. <strong>Mr  Butler </strong>asked the Minister of Enterprise,  Trade and Investment to outline her strategy to develop an all-Ireland economy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO752/09> (AQO 752/09)</a></p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment</strong>: My Department works  with the Republic   of Ireland in areas that  are mutually beneficial and in situations in which there is a sound economic  basis for so doing. Recent events have shown that there is now a global economy  and that it is important to develop strong economic links with the rest of the  world and not focus solely on our closest neighbour.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Butler</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Ba mhaith liom mo bhu&iacute;ochas a  thabhairt don Aire as an fhreagra sin. I thank the Minister for that answer.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister recently announced an independent review of  economic policy. The terms of reference were given to the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and  Investment. However, they contain only one small reference to North/South. They  also mention the Varney Review, which contained a number of submissions about  an all-Ireland economy and about the development of a joined-up approach, in  particular, between development agencies in the North and in the South and with  the Irish Government.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member must ask a question.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Butler</strong>:  In the present economic climate, what is the Minister doing to ensure that  those links &mdash; particularly between IDA Ireland and Invest NI &mdash; are  strengthened?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: I believe that the Member is referring to the terms of  reference for the review of Invest NI and economic policy. It is a consequence  of the Varney Review and of the need to examine that area, and the Department  is happy to do so. As the Member said, the terms of reference have been shared  with the Committee and I look forward to its response on the remit and terms of  reference.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">As I said in my answer to the Member&rsquo;s preliminary  question, Northern Ireland  is operating in a global economy, and it would be very short-sighted to put all  our focus on looking southwards. At present, the border actually makes good  economic sense for people living in Northern Ireland because the recent  decline in sterling against the Euro helps improve the competitiveness of local  exports. Thirty per cent of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  sales outside the UK go to  the Republic of Ireland. Therefore, the border helps  companies in Northern    Ireland to export their goods. I hope that  that will offset some of the negative impacts that companies face due to the  present global and national economic situation.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  The Minister knows that all indications are that the Northern Ireland economy will grow  this year, albeit by a small amount. However, I was reminded at the weekend  that J K Galbraith said:</p>
	        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The only function of economic forecasting is to make  astrology look respectable.&rdquo;</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">What analysis has her Department carried out on the  effect of the recession on the once Celtic tiger economy of the South, and how  will it affect Northern    Ireland?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: Although things have been going well for us and the economy has  been growing over the past 10 years, we will face a downturn, as will most  economies; however, we are not officially in a recession. According to forecasts  that have been given to my Department, the economy will continue to grow next  year, albeit at a very slow rate; but it is still growth and we should take  some comfort from that. I have always been of the opinion that we must not talk  ourselves into a recession, but rather that we should deal with the realities  of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  economy. Therefore, there will be growth next year, albeit a small amount.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Armstrong</strong>:  In the light of the downturn in the economic situation in the Republic of Ireland,  does the Minister agree that Northern Ireland  is in a far stronger economic position while it remains joined to the rest of  the United Kingdom  &mdash; the fifth-largest economy in the world &mdash; than would be the case if we were in  an all-Ireland arrangement? Does she agree that North/South economic activity  is important, but it can never been at the expense of a United Kingdom  linkage?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: The short answer is yes. GB remains the destination for most of  our external sales, some 55%. When we talk about &ldquo;North/Southery&rdquo;, it is  important to remember that the east-west links remain the most important to Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  economy.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Questions 4 and 5 have been withdrawn.</p>
	        <p class="H5StageHeading">Global Economic Downturn</p>
	        <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">6. <strong>Mr  Gardiner </strong>asked the Minister of Enterprise,  Trade and Investment what implications the global economic downturn will have  on the Programme for Government&rsquo;s target of 300 companies exporting to Great Britain.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO718/09> (AQO 718/09)</a></p>
	        <p class="H5StageHeading">Global Economic Downturn</p>
	        <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">10. <strong>Rev Dr  Robert Coulter </strong>asked the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment what  implications the global economic downturn will have on the Programme for  Government&rsquo;s target of 45 new business start-ups exporting outside the United  Kingdom.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a name=AQO717/09>(AQO 717/09)</a></p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: With your permission, Mr Deputy Speaker, I will answer  questions 6 and 10 together. The economic environment is much more challenging  than it has been for some time, making it exceptionally difficult to forecast  with any degree of confidence. With the slowdown in the global economy  reflecting turbulence in the financial markets, there are inevitable  implications for the wider regional economy.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Programme for Government&rsquo;s target of 300 businesses  exporting to Great Britain  relates to the next three years up to 2011. The target for the current year is  100 businesses, against which Invest NI has assisted 40 new businesses to date,  and work is ongoing with a further 30 entrepreneurs. Similarly, a three-year  target has been set for 45 new business start-ups exporting outside the UK. Against  this year&rsquo;s target of 15 new business start-ups, Invest NI has supported seven  to date, and the pipeline of prospective cases is quite healthy, with ongoing  discussions involving 12 potential new businesses.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Although Invest NI&rsquo;s performance in the first half of the  year has been largely on track, the prevailing conditions will inevitably make  achieving those three-year targets much more challenging, particularly as they  begin to affect the ability of start-up and small businesses to grow outside Northern Ireland.  Against that, the Northern    Ireland value proposition for foreign direct  investment remains strong.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Invest NI continues to target companies wishing to avail of  well-qualified and talented people in a cost-competitive, pro-business  operating environment that is both culturally compatible and close to its  customers. That approach has been very successful to date, with the software  sector in particular achieving rapid growth. Employment in the sector has grown  by more than 60% since 2002, reaching 13,000 in 2004. Forecasts predict that by  2021, the sector in Northern    Ireland will employ about 20,000 people.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Software companies continue to invest here despite the  current climate. Last week, for example, I announced that north American  telecommunications company BTI Systems Inc is establishing a &pound;6 million  European headquarters in Northern    Ireland. That investment, which is supported  by Invest NI, will promote 60 high-quality software engineering jobs,  generating more than &pound;2&middot;2 million annually in wages and salaries for the local  economy.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Invest NI&rsquo;s existing client companies also benefit  significantly from its ongoing market visit programme, which encourages and  supports opportunities to begin, as first-time exporters, to expand their  presence in existing overseas markets or to enter new ones. Invest NI&rsquo;s  programme for the current year is particularly comprehensive, offering clients  the opportunity to explore business opportunities in more than 20 countries  worldwide. Therefore, I assure the Member that, against this difficult economic  backdrop, Invest NI is continuing to work extensively with companies and entrepreneurs  whose business strategies and investment decisions are essential to progressing  towards the targets in the Executive&rsquo;s Programme for Government.</p>
	        <p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gardiner</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her comprehensive answer. Are there any other  strategies that she can put in place in order to assist small and medium-sized  businesses, which are the backbone of our economy?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: I concur with the Member; those businesses are the backbone of  our economy. My Department has taken several actions, in conjunction with  Invest NI, to help companies to manage the economic downturn in response to the  current circumstances. For example, Invest NI held two awareness seminars at  the end of September 2008 in Belfast  and Cookstown to offer specialist advice to businesses. I attended the Belfast event and announced  a &pound;5 million accelerated support fund, which offers fast-track advice and  assistance to businesses that are feeling the impact of the current economic  circumstances on their competitiveness.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Cash flow is one of the biggest issues for our small  indigenous companies. The fund also provides companies with an opportunity to  take up five days&rsquo; free on-site diagnostic support. Businesses can tap into the  &pound;5 million fund for particular projects that will help them to get over the  current economic difficulties.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I was pleased with the number of businesses that attended  those events. From what I have heard, they are working very well.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Robert  Coulter</strong>: I thank the Minister for her answer. Will she outline what new  initiatives she has proposed in talks with the Minister of Finance and  Personnel that will help small businesses in this time of economic crisis?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: As well as the &pound;5 million that was made available to Invest NI,  which I have just mentioned, &pound;4&middot;9 million was made available to the Carbon  Trust in order to deal with energy efficiency. Not surprisingly, energy prices  are still a huge issue for some of our small companies and, indeed, for some of  our larger companies. That money was well spent, and, as I said in reply to a  question from the Chairperson of the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment, if there is  a need to re-examine that funding, I will be happy to do so.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I am sometimes asked about what is being done for companies  that are not Invest NI clients. My Department has added a new section to the  nibusinessinfo.co.uk website, entitled &lsquo;Beat the Credit Crunch&rsquo;, which provides  practical advice and guidance on managing finance and taking steps to improving  efficiency. Members would do well to look at that website, because it is  comprehensive and contains a great deal of good advice for businesses. However,  I have made it clear that, if there is a need to advertise that website, I will  be happy to do so.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>:  The Minister has anticipated one part of my question with regard to non-INI  client companies, and I am glad to hear that that matter will be kept under  review. In the context of the global downturn, will the Minister, her  Department and the Department of Finance and Personnel examine the  circumstances of many businesses that are being levied with rates charges for  empty properties? In many cases, those properties are empty not as a result of  any calculation on the part of the business concerned to bank property or to  blight areas for others but simply because market conditions dictate that they  do not have the tenants or the business to occupy those premises.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The impact of the additional rates burden on empty  properties is making a difference for some businesses in the choices that they  are making with regard to payrolls. Will the Minister address that issue?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment</strong>: I thank the  Chairperson of the Committee for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment for his comments. Invest NI and the Department are  conscious of the importance, and the impact, of global economic conditions and  the effect that the situation is having on the decisions that businesspeople  have to make for their companies. Companies are tightening their belts and  increasing their focus on cost containment. If Mr Durkan sets out his concerns  in more detail, I will be happy to have a discussion with him.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McLaughlin</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. The Minister has very helpfully  addressed the point that I was going to make, but I want to press a particular  issue. In noting the original question, I welcome the fact that there were no  sounds of heads falling off when exporting from here to Great Britain  was mentioned. My point focuses on the small and medium-sized enterprises and  the social economy enterprises. Will the Minister go a step further than she  has indicated, by ensuring that equal focus and attention is given to those  sectors, given the global economic downturn? Those sectors have been the stable  part of the economy and, in the current circumstances, represent the best  chance of growing the economy.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: I thank the Member for his question. I was very pleased to  attend the Bryson Charitable Group&rsquo;s AGM this year, at which there was talk  about growth and more employment for that sector &mdash; therefore, the social  economy is very important to my Department. A draft social economy strategy  will, I think this week, be sent to the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment for  consideration. It is vitally important that we deal with that sector because,  when we are in difficult times, it is often that sector that grows, and,  therefore, I appreciate the value of it.</p>
	        <p class="H5StageHeading">Home Tourism Market</p>
	        <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">7. <strong>Mr  McCallister </strong>asked the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment, given  the current downturn in the economy, what plans the Northern Ireland Tourist  Board has to focus on the home market to encourage potential holiday makers to  stay and holiday in Northern Ireland.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO720/09> (AQO  720/09)</a></p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment</strong>: The Northern Ireland  Tourist Board (NITB) undertakes a year-round calendar of activities to promote Northern Ireland to both the domestic and Republic of Ireland markets through a series of  marketing campaigns and PR. In 2008 NITB ran a campaign solely targeted at the  domestic market. It included press advertising, leaflet distribution, PR and  web promotion, all designed to encourage Northern Ireland residents to take  a holiday or day trip at home. NITB has also just launched an autumn campaign  in both Northern Ireland and  the Republic of Ireland which will run until the  Christmas period, and will include press advertising, web promotion, radio,  outdoor advertising, direct mail and PR.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s answer. I further stress the importance of this issue,  and ask the Minister to make sure that all is being done to promote Northern Ireland in light of the economic  downturn, so that residents of Northern    Ireland can explore the natural beauty of  our countryside and enjoy our inland waterways and, especially, our  hospitality, particularly in south Down.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: I was wondering when the advertisement would sneak in, but  there it is. NITB is aware of the potential of the Northern   Ireland and Republic   of Ireland markets &mdash; it is  an issue that I have raised directly with that organisation. It has recently  conducted a review of those areas, which demonstrated that there was potential  in both the Republic of Ireland market and the home market in Northern Ireland.  The Republic of Ireland is a major source of untapped  growth potential, and that is a job for the Northern Ireland Tourist Board, as  we develop the five signature projects, in one of which I know that the Member  will be particularly interested. We are pressing ahead with all five of those  projects.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  It is always a pleasure to go to south Down, and it is even more of a pleasure  to go through Strangford to get there. Has the Minister any plans to change the  delivery of tourism at a local level in light of the changes proposed in the  review of public administration (RPA), due to be implemented in 2011?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: I rarely go through Strangford to get to Newry and Mourne, but  I will try it the next time to see if it is a better route. The Member  mentioned the RPA, and he will know my view, given my previous ministerial  position, that it is vitally important to achieve the buy-in of the new local  councils in relation to issues such as tourism. It is an area that I am  currently considering, to see how we can improve the buy-in of local people and  local councils. I recently had the opportunity to attend a very good tourism  conference hosted by Newry and Mourne District Council, and I hope that there  will be more such buy-ins by the local councils in the future. It is certainly  an area that I want to explore.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs McGill</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for her  response to Mr McCallister, who mentioned south Down.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I ask the Minister for reassurance that County Tyrone  and in particular areas of west Tyrone, including the Glenelly Valley,  Omagh, Gortin and Greencastle, will get their fair share of promotion by NITB.  I ask that question because I have raised that issue and will raise it again  with NITB. I seek reassurance from the Minister that those areas will get their  fair share of promotion, because my constituents have raised that issue.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment</strong>: This is rapidly  becoming a tour around Northern    Ireland. The Member knows where I am from  and, therefore, my position on the issue. I assure her that all parts of Northern Ireland must get their fair share of  promotion, because each part of Northern    Ireland offers a different product, quality  and experience to tourists. The five signature projects remain the driver for  the Northern Ireland Tourist Board, and the Member will be aware of them.  Although a signature project is not located right beside west Tyrone, the area  will see the benefit of those projects. Fermanagh, where I live, should have  had its own signature project, and although it does not have one, I believe  that it will see the benefit of them.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I mentioned local government and councils because they will  have an increasing role to play in tourism. I hope that Members will encourage  their councils to become involved in any measure that we propose.</p>
	        <p class="H5StageHeading">Credit Unions</p>
	        <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">8. <strong>Mr Brady </strong>asked the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment when she will take  forward proposals to provide credit unions with the same financial powers as  their counterparts in the Republic of Ireland and England.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=AQO757/09> (AQO 757/09)</a></p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment</strong>: The Assembly&rsquo;s  Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment  is undertaking an inquiry into &ldquo;The Role and Potential of Credit Unions, and  Opportunities and Barriers in Northern    Ireland&rdquo;.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">My Department has provided briefing papers to the Committee  on the regulatory framework that is applied under transferred powers in respect  of credit unions in Northern    Ireland. Likewise, the Financial Services  Authority has provided a paper, including briefing on the legislative and  regulatory framework that applies in the United Kingdom.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I plan to await the outcome of the inquiry and will give  full and careful consideration to the Committee&rsquo;s views and recommendations in  due course.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: I  thank the Minister for her answer. With respect, the Minister&rsquo;s tour could not  be complete without mentioning Newry and Armagh.  I declare an interest as a member of Newry credit union. In light of the  economic downturn, does the Minister think that financial powers should be  expedited, particularly in light of people&rsquo;s problems in accessing credit from  banks?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment</strong>: At present, there is  no evidence to suggest that the financial environment is having an adverse  effect on the credit union movement in Northern Ireland. The Department  and I put on record our appreciation of the role and the work of credit unions  throughout Northern Ireland.  I am aware that there was a particular issue about the Member&rsquo;s credit union;  however, I understand that that issue has been resolved. I hope that that  credit union and all the others in Northern Ireland will continue to  provide their service to the community.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>: I  thank the Minister for her recognition of the work of credit unions. The tour  has finally arrived in Lagan   Valley. Will the Minister  outline the number of credit unions in Northern Ireland and detail how  much credit is outstanding in the credit union system?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment</strong>: One hundred and  eighty credit unions are registered in Northern Ireland, and they have a  total of &pound;740 million in deposits and &pound;490 million in loans. That is not a bad  position in which to be. At present, the maximum amount that credit unions can  loan is &pound;15,000. That may not seem like much, but it provides a useful service  to many communities.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">However, the average loan is around &pound;3,000. Therefore,  credit unions provide a very good service to their communities.</p>
	        <p class="TimePeriod">4.00 pm</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>:  Will the Minister outline her plans to introduce public funding for credit  unions in Northern Ireland  in line with the situation in Great    Britain?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I am not aware that credit unions in Great Britain  receive public funding. However, they are regulated by the FSA, which does not  happen here. Likewise, the recent change in the Republic of Ireland  means that credit union branches there are included in the state deposit  guarantees. Therefore, Northern Ireland  is the only area in the British Isles that is  not covered by a statutory scheme, which is something that the ETI Committee  will report to me on.

	        <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Debate resumed on amendment to motion:</p>
	        <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly calls for an inter-departmental,  multi-disciplinary strategy, informed by the Patten report and the Criminal  Justice Review report 2000, to include proposals on alcohol-related crime and  prolific offenders, aimed at reducing harm and promoting safety in local  communities, to be led by the First Minister and deputy First Minister. &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Mr Adams.]</span></p>
	        <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Which amendment was:</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Leave out all after &ldquo;Assembly&rdquo; and insert</p>
	        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;recognises that offending and anti-social behaviour  is often the result of unmet, complex social, educational and health needs; and  calls for an inter-departmental, cross-sectional strategy, led by the First  Minister and deputy First Minister, that ensures safer communities by  addressing issues of poverty, poor health, low educational achievement and lack  of community and public resources.&rdquo;</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McKay</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Alcohol-related crime, drug-related  crime and antisocial behaviour have already left a scar on all our communities.  For many households, crime of that nature is one of the major issues that they  want elected representatives to address, because it constitutes a direct threat  to homes, families and communities. My colleague from West Belfast, Mr Gerry  Adams, outlined several examples of good practice in community justice and  making communities safer in other parts of Ireland and across the water. I  will refer to an example in Scotland.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Earlier this year, political representatives from all the  main parties on the Policing Board, and independent members who are on the  board, went to Edinburgh to meet the Minister  responsible for policing and justice in Scotland, Kenny MacAskill. The trip  was very informative and highlighted the potential of having policing and  justice powers in this institution.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Several politicians have said recently that policing and  justice is not a major issue for our communities. That is the wrong position to  take, because it is the number one issue in many of our communities alongside,  if not above, the economic downturn.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Kieran McCarthy from the Alliance Party referred to drugs  in Glasgow. The  Scottish Administration have taken that issue by the horns and have used their  initiative by providing the courts with drug treatment and testing orders to  deal with offenders who are involved in serious drug misuse. That has delivered  results and has eliminated re-offending among 50% of those who have  participated. Drugs courts were also introduced in Scotland,  which have been held up as models of good practice and have been copied in many  countries throughout Europe.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The recent debate on the sale of alcohol to people under 21  has caused a stir in Scotland, but at least the Scottish Administration have  the power to debate the issue to the best of their ability. We cannot have that  debate to its fullest potential here until we have powers of policing and  justice, which will make a radical difference to our communities. Dealing with  policing and justice issues is not something to put on the back burner, because  our communities will suffer as a result.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">A properly thought-out strategy that examines community  safety with clear lines of responsibility is required. The existing situation,  with community safety partnerships on the one hand, and district policing  partnerships on the other, is ridiculous. The responsibilities of both groups  should be brought together into a single model.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">We heard today, and in many debates over the past few  weeks, about the economic downturn and how it affects all Departments in the  Assembly. The downturn will have a major affect with regard to crime, and  increasing unemployment and poverty. Therefore, there needs to be a greater  urgency to the debate about addressing community safety now in order to prepare  for, and to prevent, an increase in crime against the community. There is no  doubt that crime will increase over the next year or two as a result of the  economic and social consequences of the economic downtown.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">It is nonsense to suggest that people are not interested in  policing and justice. For example, I am sure that members of the public would  have far preferred local politicians to have dealt with the matter of 50%  remission for sex offenders, rather than direct rule Ministers, who made a mess  of the issue. If that had been in the hands of local politicians, we would have  dealt with it much more efficiently and with greater urgency.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, it is not, as the Ulster Unionists suggested,  premature to discuss this issue, because it affects the lives of all our  constituents, and no elected representative should neglect that fact. Go raibh  maith agat.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Purvis</strong>:  The debate has been wide ranging, and possibly the widest interpretation of a  motion that I have heard. A number of cross-cutting issues emerged. Nelson  McCausland spoke of the issues being societal and related to family, community  and the legacy of the conflict. Danny Kennedy said that the motion was unclear,  but that it was justice-focused.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Alex Attwood said that there was a need for a  multi-disciplinary and interdepartmental approach, and outlined the problems  with a key element of the criminal justice system, namely, the Public  Prosecution Service. I wonder what Kieran McCarthy will do when he has no more  paramilitaries to blame.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Jim Shannon spoke about the issues in his constituency, and  how they need to be addressed by education programmes providing options for  young people. That goes to the heart of the amendment, which is about  addressing the causes of offending behaviour through support, advice and  co-ordination.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Martina Anderson talked about individual cases and  difficulties with the criminal justice system. However, looking at the criminal  justice system alone will not deal with the causes of harmful behaviour. What  is needed is a multi-departmental approach.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Other Members spoke about Sinn F&eacute;in and the devolution of  policing and justice, the need for support for the police and the rule of law.  That is not in question. However, the criminal justice system and the police  will not resolve the issues. They are complex: offending behaviour comes from  unmet needs that are the root cause of harmful, offending behaviour in the  community.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly can give a lead and assist the criminal  justice system and the PSNI by developing and implementing an  interdepartmental, cross-sectoral strategy in order to address the causes of  offending behaviour. We heard from Members about how Departments can play their  role with regard to education, social development and health. The criminal  justice system cannot do that on its own.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The motion does not go far enough. It looks at punitive  measures and not at the causes. If we do not start to address the causes of  harmful, offending behaviour, we are stacking it up for ever. The criminal  justice system cannot do this on its own, but the Assembly can.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I support the amendment.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank all those Members who  participated in the debate. I thank, too, those who tabled the motion, and Dawn  Purvis for proposing an amendment.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Dawn Purvis&rsquo;s contribution in support of her amendment  echoed the contributions of Members from all other parties, which show that the  Assembly is conscious that those inter-related difficulties depend on other  factors in order to be tackled effectively.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The motion calls for an interdepartmental and  multidisciplinary strategy that is informed by the Patten Report and the  Criminal Justice Review report. The strategy must include proposals to deal  with alcohol-related crime and prolific offenders. Essentially, its aim is to  reduce harm and promote safety in local communities. It calls for that  particular strategy to be led by the First Minister and the deputy First  Minister.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">When Gerry Adams moved the motion, he made it clear that he  endorses and supports fully the amendment&rsquo;s intention. However, although it is  not its intention, unfortunately, the amendment goes in the opposite direction  to the motion. It makes no reference whatsoever to the criminal justice system.  My party&rsquo;s concern, and an acute concern of everyone in the community, is that,  often, the public equates rehabilitative work with young people and support for  families with the lack of an assurance that a punishment will fit a crime or  that there will sanctions for people who become a burden to their communities.  Therefore, the Assembly must not, through adopting the amendment, send out the  wrong message, which is that it does not recognise the need for appropriate  sanctions to be taken against people who offend in the community.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">From the outset, I want to point out that the motion does  not refer to young people. It is unfortunate that when most people hear about  crime and antisocial behaviour, they automatically assume that it involves  young people or that it is the exclusive preserve of young people. All public  representatives will acknowledge that, periodically, people from every walk of  life are involved in criminal activity or antisocial behaviour. It is not  particularly rare to hear about people from professional backgrounds who are  drunk and disorderly at public events, for example, and who let themselves  down. They certainly do not come from marginalised or deprived backgrounds.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">All Members who contributed to the debate, particularly the  mover of the motion and supporting colleagues, have said clearly that they  fully recognise that to resort to the criminal justice system is not the only  way to tackle prolific offending, antisocial behaviour, and so on &mdash; far from  it. My party is wedded and totally committed to the need to ensure that  anti-poverty measures are in place; that support is available to families; and  that young people, in particular, can, as much as possible, be diverted away  from the criminal justice system and, therefore, do not end up in it. Evidence  shows that once young people become involved with the criminal justice system,  they are more likely to end up in it again than they would if they had been  diverted away from it at an early stage.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The motion is not designed to deal exclusively with young  people. It aims to deal with issues that all elected representatives encounter  in their constituencies on a daily basis. The motion aims to locate a  co-ordinated approach in OFMDFM that will leave to the criminal justice system  the matters for which it is responsible. When I refer to the criminal justice  system, I refer to it in its entirety &mdash; hopefully, in the context of the  transfer of policing and justice powers to locally elected representatives.  That will add to the array of democratically accountable institutions, such as  the Policing Board, district policing partnerships and the plethora of local  arrangements that people in many communities have with the police in order to  tackle those problems at their source.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, my party agrees with the motion and the  intention behind the amendment. A comprehensive and holistic approach is needed  in order to tackle many of those issues that have, unfortunately, become a scourge  and a serious burden for many communities.</p>
	        <p class="TimePeriod">4.15 pm</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">We recognise that it is not just a matter of dealing with  the issues on an anti-poverty basis, by providing support for families, or by  making sure that the criminal justice system and the various other statutory  agencies employ all of the appropriate diversionary measures, particularly, but  not exclusively, for young people. We must send a message to hard-pressed  communities that there will be sanctions for offenders, particularly repeat  offenders.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I am very pleased that none of the Members who spoke  discounted the motion or criticised its import. The odd, silly remark was made  about matters that are far too important to be drawn into a point-scoring  exercise, so I will not even address those. All Members who spoke recognised  the validity of the content of the motion as being among a range of issues that  affect all of the communities that we collectively represent.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">For Sinn F&eacute;in, the amendment, unfortunately, does not go  far enough. However, it does have proper intent, and Dawn Purvis spoke well in  support of it. I suggest that she does not take issue with the substantive  motion, and she recognised some of the implicit elements that Gerry Adams went  some considerable way to clarify.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">We do not want to fall out over not supporting the  amendment, but we feel that, were the amended motion to be carried, it would  send out a very negative signal to many people in our community. People in our  community need to hear that we, as elected representatives, are fully cognisant  of the problems that beleaguered communities often have to face. There is no  quick fix for many of those problems. We are fully aware that there is often a  clear link between levels of deprivation and marginalisation, particularly  within working-class communities. However, crime and antisocial behaviour go  well beyond those communities; there is no stereotypical criminal.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">In proposing the motion, Sinn F&eacute;in is very clear that a  comprehensive approach is required to support young people; to create the  appropriate and necessary anti-poverty and equality-related strategies; and to  give appropriate measures of support to those families who need it. The  community needs to hear that we are all fully aware that safeguards against  offenders are necessary, particularly against those who have the propensity to  offend repeatedly. Unfortunately, we have heard, all too often, of the crimes  that are committed within our community. For example, just last week, we heard  about a sex offence. That sort of crime has been a plague in South   Belfast and other areas. In another case, a young woman had her  car hijacked on a main road in broad daylight.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I thank all who participated in the debate; I appreciate  very much that no-one rejected the motion and that its validity was recognised.  Sinn F&eacute;in accepts entirely the intent behind the amendment, but, because it  makes no reference whatsoever to the criminal justice system, we cannot support  it &mdash; it would send out an extremely negative and worrying message to the wider  community. We are willing however, to take on board the amendment&rsquo;s intent and  content.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">This debate is only the start. Even if the transfer of  policing and justice powers were to take place tomorrow, or if those powers  were to be given to OFMDFM, this debate would mark the start of our work, not  the end, and it is certainly not definitive. Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Question, that the amendment be made, put and negatived.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Main Question put and agreed to.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
	        <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly calls for an inter-departmental, multi-disciplinary  strategy, informed by the Patten report and the Criminal Justice Review report  2000, to include proposals on alcohol-related crime and prolific offenders,  aimed at reducing harm and promoting safety in local communities, to be led by  the First Minister and deputy First Minister.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Members may take their ease for a few minutes before the next item  of debate.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">(Mr Speaker in the Chair)</p>
	        <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="8"></a>Private Members&rsquo; Business</p>
	        <p class="H4StageHeading">Removal of the Over Thirty Month Status</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I have been advised that the Minister for Regional Development, Mr Conor  Murphy, will respond to the motion on behalf of the Minister of Agriculture and  Rural Development. The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour  and 30 minutes for the debate. The proposer of the motion will have 10 minutes  in which to propose and 10 minutes in which to make a winding-up speech. All  other Members who are called to speak will have five minutes.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I  beg to move</p>
	        <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly calls on the Minister of Agriculture and  Rural Development to take immediate steps to remove the Over Thirty Month  status from cattle entering the food chain.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Given the situation in the rest of Europe and the review being carried out by the Food  Standards Agency, it is particularly relevant that I bring the motion to the  House today. The Minister must take the lead in ensuring that we do not fall  behind Europe once again in the status of our  produce. She must ensure that Northern Ireland  is at the forefront of Europe in marketing its  quality produce.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I will outline a brief history of how Northern Ireland  came to be in the current situation. In the 1980s and 1990s, food scares were  the norm, with &ldquo;listeria hysteria&rdquo;, as it was called, salmonella in eggs and  BSE. BSE was, by far, the worst food scare and caused huge &mdash; and justifiable  &mdash;public concern. Evidence of BSE first appeared in the 1980s, mostly in the  latter part of that decade, and grew rapidly in the 1990s. Concern that BSE  could be transmitted to humans became public, and, in the mid-1990s, the  emergence of new variant CJD provided clearer evidence to support that.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">From mid-1995 to March 1996, that concern grew rapidly, and  action was taken because it was believed that new variant CJD was transmitted  from infected meat. Public concern was exploited by some attention-seekers who  spoke as scientists but did not base their analysis on facts. Tabloid headlines  warned that a generation could be wiped out, or that it was anticipated that  100,000 people would die each year, and they caused the public to be genuinely  concerned about the safety of eating beef.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">On the back of that concern, several steps were taken, and  some, such as the removal of meat-and-bone meal from animal feed, were  scientifically based. However, the ban on beef from animals more than 30 months  old being used for public consumption was introduced despite evidence that BSE  did not normally kick in until cattle were approximately five or six years old  &mdash; although, in exceptional cases, younger animals could be affected.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I have no doubt that, when John Major announced the ban on  public consumption of cattle over 30 months of age, he was attempting to instil  public confidence in beef consumption. However, that ban has lasted more than  10 years, has led to the incineration of tens of thousands of animals that  would have been fit for human consumption, and has cost the Government billions  of pounds. Bearing in mind that thousands of people in the world are starving,  it was wrong to slaughter and incinerate so many animals that could have been  eaten.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Over the past 12 years, approximately 150 people have died  since the emergence of new variant CJD. Every one of those deaths is a tragedy.  Given the nature of the disease, those deaths have been debilitating and undignified.  However, we must approach the issue in a proportional manner. The Government  have spent less money on fighting other illnesses, such as cancer, and we must  adopt a wise approach. Therefore, sensible and rational measures such as  removing meat and bonemeal from the food chain, and not using animals that were  born before 1996, will facilitate progress.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, I support the Food Standards Agency, who, in  conjunction with the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee, stated last  week:</p>
	        <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The increased risks to human health estimated by the  model from raising the age at which healthy slaughtered cattle are tested for  BSE (up to 60 months, the highest age modelled) are very small. The model  estimates that much less than one BSE case would be missed annually in the Great Britain  herd by increasing the age of testing to 60 months for the healthy slaughter  surveillance stream.&rdquo;</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Therefore, support for the motion will not put  public health at risk. It is a proportional response to a measure that was introduced  many years ago. In 2008, to date, two animals have tested positive for BSE in Northern Ireland.  Those animals are, normally, much older than 60 months.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">We must make progress. The issue has cost the public purse  approximately &pound;3 billion. Furthermore, the ban has cost the agricultural  community not only money, but lives. It is a tragic fact that many farmers in  the United Kingdom  have taken their own lives since the ban was imposed. Those farmers feared for  the future of their businesses, and committed suicide. Members must bear that  in mind.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The European Commission intends to introduce a 48-month  testing regime, and the Assembly and the Minister must ensure that we are not  left behind again.</p>
	        <p class="TimePeriod">4.30 pm</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">When we were first excluded from exporting meat in 1996, no  one would have believed that it would take us almost 10 years to get back into  the export market; however, that is the reality. We cannot afford to hang back  and allow the other EU countries to move ahead of us. We must ensure that beef  from Northern Ireland  has the same status as beef from the rest of the EU countries.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Some supermarkets have indicated that they wish to continue  to mark down the price of beef that is over 30 months old. For anyone who does  not know, prime beef is prime beef whether it is 30 months and two days old, or  29 months and 28 days old. It should be put on the shelves at the same price.  It is likely that older animals were produced in a more healthy way, using  fewer compounds and a more grass-based diet. That is a more natural form of  production. If supermarkets did right by their customers, they would offer  farmers more for a product that was produced by exclusively grass-based means,  as opposed to penalising farmers who wish to operate that system.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">We must make it clear to supermarkets that it is wholly  wrong for them to go down their chosen route. The Government say that meat over  30 months of age is safe &mdash; a position that is backed up by the Food Standards  Agency, SEAC and the European Commission. The supermarkets stand alone in  reducing the price of that meat, and their only reason is not to pass the  saving to customers, but to bolster their coffers. Farmers currently receive  approximately &pound;20-&pound;30 less for each animal once it reaches 30 months.  Supermarkets must take that on board.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">A decision on the matter is long overdue. In the public  interest, Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom must move forward  and away from BSE, allow that tragic piece of history in our food-production  era to pass and &mdash; thankfully &mdash; consign it to the annals of history.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Doherty</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I support the motion, but I do so  rather reluctantly, as I find it rather silly and futile. Anyone who is aware  of these issues knows &mdash; or should know &mdash; that the EU Commission intends to  change the over-30-month status to over 48 months from 1 January 2009. In the  meantime, the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development must engage in  dialogue and understanding with the Food Standards Agency, which is in the  remit of the Health Department. That is currently taking place. I find the  motion unnecessary as it is quite clear that the work to bring about the  necessary change is ongoing.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Savage</strong>: I  support the motion. From the outset, I stress that the Ulster Unionist Party is  fully supportive of the calls to remove the over-30-month status, as it is an  unnecessary hangover from the BSE era.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">In March 1996, the over-30-months rule was intro&shy;duced as a  control that was aimed at protecting the public health during the BSE crisis.  The Food Standards Agency reviewed the over-30-month rule in July 2002 to  consider whether it was still appropriate in light of the BSE epidemic. The  agency&rsquo;s review was assisted by two committees &mdash; a joint SEAC and FSA  risk-assessment group and a core stakeholder group, which represented a range  of stakeholders, including the farming and meat industries, and consumers.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">In July 2003, the Food Standards Agency board advised  Ministers that a move to replace the over-30-month rule by testing all of the  over-30-month cattle that went through UK abattoirs was justified on the  grounds of public health risk in relation to food and proportionality.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, the Food Standards Agency advised Ministers  not to change the over-30-month rule until they were satisfied that the  necessary arrangements had been implemented.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">European rural affairs Ministers later decided that all  cattle born or reared in the UK  before 1 August 1996 should be permanently excluded from the food chain. In  July 2004, the Food Standards Agency&rsquo;s board advised Ministers that replacing  the over-30-month rule by BSE-testing cattle born on or before 1 August 1996  continued to be justified on grounds of risk to the consumer.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">In light of the FSA&rsquo;s advice, on 1 December 2004, the  Government announced the start of a managed transition from the over-30-month  rule to a robust BSE-testing system for cattle aged over 30 months and born on  or after 1 August 1996. An independent advisory group was established to assist  the Food Standards Agency in advising Ministers about the robustness of  testing. On 15 August 2005, the Food Standards Agency board considered evidence  from the independent advisory group that a BSE-testing regime would be robust  if it were to be effectively implemented, complied with and enforced.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">On 7 September 2005, the Deputy Prime Minister gave the  Committee on Domestic Affairs clearance to replace the over-30-month rule with  a system of testing over-30-month cattle for BSE. From November 2005, the  over-30-month rule was replaced by a testing system for cattle born or reared  in the UK  after 1 August 1996. That testing regime complies with EU rules that came into  effect in 2003 and it limits the amount of state aid that member states may  contribute towards the cost of BSE testing of cattle for human consumption to  &pound;27 a head.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Parallel legislation was to be introduced in all UK regions by  their respective Administrations. Consequently, from 7 November 2005, the Food  Standards Agency introduced measures in Northern Ireland to keep  DARD-licensed slaughterhouses under tighter control. Animals over 30-months old  may be slaughtered as long as they have achieved a negative TB-test result.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">This matter has gone on for far too long. Since the  over-30-month rule was introduced in 1996, incidences of BSE have continued to  decline, the number of BSE cases in most EU-member states has almost halved and  no new cases have been registered in 14 of the 27 member states. Ending the  over-30-month rule was considered to pose only a minimal risk, and a realistic  estimate of that risk was claimed to be less than one additional variant CJD  case in the next 60 years.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">In September 2008, the European Commission revealed that it  will increase the BSE-testing age for cattle to 48 months. Many people from the  Ulster Farmers&rsquo; Union and in farming  organisations realise that that is essential.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Member please bring his remarks to a close?</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Savage</strong>: I  support the motion; it is long overdue. We do not wish to lose the foreign  markets that have been established over years, and it is now time to make  progress.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P J Bradley</strong>:  I have no difficulty in identifying with the motion&rsquo;s principle aims; however,  given that we have just heard about how recent amendments to EU legislation  allow member states to apply to reduce their BSE-monitoring programmes, it is  solely up to the UK Government to pursue this matter.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The motion calls for the Minister of Agriculture and Rural  Development to take immediate steps to remove the over-30-month status for  cattle entering the food chain; however, that will come about only if DEFRA and  the UK Government apply to have the testing age increased to 48 months.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Before making the necessary approaches to Europe,  the UK Government should seek to extend the testing period from 30 months to 60  months. That figure is the result of analysis by the European Food Safety  Authority&rsquo;s veterinary laboratories, which indicated that increasing the age at  which cattle may be slaughtered for human consumption, and are tested for BSE,  from 30 months to 48 or 60 months would be unlikely to result in any  test-positive cattle being missed.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The sentiments expressed in the motion by my fellow Committee  members Edwin Poots and Trevor Clarke are in keeping with what DARD, the  Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development, the UFU, NIAPA and the  livestock industry dearly wish to happen.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">If the change from 30 months to 48 or 60 months comes  about, that should give the meat industry economic benefits. The cost of  producing meat would be reduced, which should &mdash; I use that word carefully &mdash;  result in producers receiving slightly higher payments for their cattle.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Unfortunately, our farming industry remains at the mercy of  the UK Government on such issues, and until an all-island agriculture industry  is established, similar in principle to the agency that promotes all-island  tourism, our farmers will have little choice but to await whatever benefits  come their way, courtesy of the UK Government. However, we all know that  Government&rsquo;s support for farming, even in England, makes miserable reading.  Indeed, the record of support for agriculture from British MEPs is even worse.  One has only to look at the British-driven proposal on pesticides to confirm  that view.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">In the past, there has been considerable reluctance from Britain to the  adjustment of BSE controls. However, as Mr Poots detailed, the industry should  take some encouragement from the positive soundings of the report on the BSE  debate that took place at the meeting of the Foods Standards Agency on 15  October 2008.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">However, should the UK Government fail to pursue the EU  offer fully, we may need to seek regional status to secure better deals for the  livestock industry. To acquire such status requires the support of the  Westminster Government, and that Government knows only too well that Scotland and Wales  are waiting in the wings, watching everything that happens in the various  regions of the United    Kingdom.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I refer to regional status because of our good record on  BSE. As far as I am aware, over the past three years, there has been only one  positive test for BSE in an over-30-months animal that was slaughtered for  human consumption. Therefore, it may be possible to attain special recognition  in Europe.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The motion is directed towards DARD. However, if, as  expected, the motion is unanimously supported in the Assembly today, DEFRA, the  Foods Standards Agency and the UK Department of Health must be told of the united  political front among stakeholders in Northern Ireland in the quest to  have the over-30-months status removed from cattle entering the food chain.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The EU agreement to raise the testing age to 40 months will  not be straightforward. Indeed, are any EU regulations straightforward? Those  Members who are familiar with the farming industry know the answer to that  question. For example, I have learned that, under the new agreement, some  matters, such as the obligatory removal of the spinal chord from carcasses,  will remain unchanged. That regulation will probably remain in place for ever.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">If and when the change comes about, it will not necessarily  change the attitudes of the processors, retailers and consumers. They will  continue to purchase to meet their respective requirements. Therefore, we could  see the development of two different markets: an under-30-months market and an  over-30-months market.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">When the motion is passed in the House, there is work that  our Members of Parliament should consider undertaking, because the EU is now  seeking applications about testing. I suggest to our MPs, two of whom are  present today, that a delegation is selected from the ranks of the 13 MPs who  are constantly working at Westminster on behalf of the people of Northern  Ireland to meet representatives of DEFRA, the Foods Standards Agency and the  Department of Health in order to deliver the wishes being expressed here today.  Other than that suggestion, I can think of no other idea.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr W McCrea</strong>:  I support the motion that has been tabled by my colleagues Edwin Poots and  Trevor Clarke. I speak to the motion not as the Chairperson of the Committee  for Agriculture and Rural Development but as a DUP Member who happens to be the  Chairperson of that Committee.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">My colleague Mr Poots has clearly and capably outlined the  DUP position on this important issue. I believe that the Department of  Agriculture and Rural Development has failed to take the necessary lead in  dealing effectively with animal-health issues and the inevitable cost to the industry.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The history of the over-30-months scheme stems from the  high incidence levels of BSE in cattle on the mainland. In Northern Ireland,  we were, mercifully and fortunately, spared much of the trauma and distress  that the disease caused as farmers there watched their animals being destroyed  before their eyes.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">However, we were faced with the rigid controls that were  aimed at protecting public health &mdash; the over-30-months scheme. Those were  testing times for the farming community, but, once again, our farmers came  through with integrity &mdash; although they bore a heavy financial burden.</p>
	        <p class="TimePeriod">4.45 pm</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The imposition of the over-30-months scheme in the United Kingdom  prohibited animals over 30 months from entering the food chain. On 7 November  2005, the 30-months rule was replaced throughout the UK with the BSE-testing regime for  all cattle over 30 months that were born on or after 1 August 1996. Since that  date, such cattle were eligible for entry into the food chain, subject to a  negative BSE test. In September of this year, the EU Health Commissioner,  Androulla Vassiliou, announced that the European Commission is to increase the  age at which cattle will be tested for BSE from 30 months to 48 months. That  announcement followed a proposal from a group of member states&rsquo; chief  veterinary officers.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The announcement was welcomed by many in the farming  industry, but, as yet, it has not been confirmed in Brussels,  or by the Ministers with the relevant responsibility in Britain and Northern Ireland. Such confirmation  would assist farmers with the costs that have been imposed on them, and it  would come at a critical time when essential savings must be made in the  farmers&rsquo; budgets.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">However, in issues relating to animal health, disease  control and the cost to the industry, the Minister of Agriculture and Rural  Development and her Department have been found asleep at the wheel. The  Committee has had to take the forefront in pressing the Department on many  issues, but, at times, it has been with little success, unfortunately. One such  example relates to the incidence of TB and brucellosis. Following the  Committee&rsquo;s forcing of the Department to confirm that there is correlation  between badgers and the incidence of TB across the Province, we expected that  the Department and the Minister would take urgent action for the sake of animal  health. However, the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development has failed  to take action for the good of animal health, despite the fact that she was  granted the authority, by the Minister of the Environment, to cull 1,000  badgers. That is the issue that we are dealing with under the 30-months scheme.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. Dr McCrea, you must return to the subject of the motion.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr McCrea</strong>:  The subject is exactly that: it relates to animal health. That is the reason  why we are seeking the removal of the over-30-months scheme. The Minister and  the Department have failed to deal with the cardinal issue of animal health.  The Minister must come up with a recommendation immediately. It was suggested  by a Member across the way that the issue relating to the over-30-months scheme  has been settled, but it has not. What is the mind of the Department of  Agriculture and Rural Development? What is the mind of the Minister? We do not  know. As usual, their thinking is woolly; they are asleep at the wheel when it  comes to taking this issue seriously.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly is appropriately and properly taking the issue  seriously and telling the Minister to deal with the issue. However, if she  deals with it in the same way that she has dealt with TB and brucellosis,  Members can be assured that she will fail, again, in her duty to protect the  health of the animals and public of Northern Ireland.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I am grateful that the European Commission  has moved on the over-30-months scheme. Farmers in the North of Ireland will be  relieved that fewer cattle will have to go through BSE testing and that they  will not have to bear the resultant costs. Despite what the Chairperson of the  Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development says, the Minister has been  responsible. Furthermore, she has acted quickly to protect the health of the  farming community and the stock here through the decisions that she has made on  various issues that have come before her in the past number of months. I  recommend that the Committee act similarly; it should act responsibly and  follow the process that is relevant to the over-30-months scheme. The process  must involve the Food Standards Agency, which has a relevant responsibility,  and the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, which is  responsible for that agency.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The process must be gone through, and I understand that  they are looking at the process favourably. The European Commission has also  indicated that it is moving on the matter, and it is important that we consult  and relate our findings to the Commission.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">It would be wrong to decide that the change will come into  force immediately and could be in place tomorrow morning. However, it is  important to ensure that the industry and the cattle in the North of Ireland  are protected. The Minister must examine the long-term effects on the standard  that has been set for health and food in the agriculture sector in the North.  We must take the long-term viewpoint into account.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The process involves the European Commission, the FSA and  the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development. It would be irresponsible  of the Minister, or anyone else, to simply decide to do away with the  over-30-months rule tomorrow morning. Everyone wants to move towards that  situation as quickly as possible, but it must be done within guidelines and  with the protection that will ensure that the industry is protected. People  throughout the world recognise that the industry here of a high standard and  has clear records of traceable stock.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">We must be aware of the present situation and recognise  that we are in a process. The European Commission has indicated clearly that it  will remove the over-30-months status. I hope that the Food Standards Agency  will react favourably and that, as a result, the thrust of the motion will be  able to go ahead. When the European Commission gives the go ahead to remove the  over-30-months status, we can export our meat on the clear understanding that  the food exported from the North of Ireland is of a very high standard.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Irwin</strong>: I  declare an interest as a farmer and as someone who has experienced the  over-30-months rule in his farm business. I welcome the opportunity to debate  the subject, and I thank my colleagues for bring it to the Floor of the  Assembly.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">There is no doubt that it is high time for the  over-30-month rule to be abolished. Indeed, the European Commission has reached  agreement on the move to 48 months, and our neighbours in the Irish Republic  are ready to welcome that move on 1 January 2009, with predicted savings of &euro;8  million a year. The move has been heralded as further proof that the BSE crisis  is well and truly past, and it is a major seal of approval for the testing  procedures that operate there.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">For years, the ruling has been a burden on farmers, and it  has cost them dearly. Many cattle approaching 30 months had not reached their  full weight potential. Nevertheless, they had to be killed before that age so  that farmers were not disadvantaged. However, as many cattle had not reached  their full weight potential, many farmers were disadvantaged.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">At a board meeting on 15 October, the Food Standards Agency  in Northern Ireland  agreed to support the move to testing at 48 months subject to a review of  current testing procedures. I welcome the statement by the FSA, although I do  not want to see another time-consuming review process further delaying what has  been agreed across Europe.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Facts sourced from the &lsquo;Farmers Guardian&rsquo; confirm that of  the 1&middot;3 million over-30-months tests carried out in the UK since November 2005  only 10 positives were found, and that the youngest animal to test positive was  48 months old. Those figures back up the success of the testing procedures  here. Shifting the limit to 48 months &mdash; as has been broadly welcomed by the  Food Standards Agency &mdash; will save our industry a significant amount of money,  time and resources.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I ask the Minister to give the matter her full attention  and, with the co-operation of the Food Standards Agency, implement the  48-months rule as soon as possible. I support the motion.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  I thank the Members who tabled the motion, and I welcome the opportunity to  debate this matter today. I too declare an interest as a member of the farming  community.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The impression is that farmers are always looking for  something that will cost the Government money, but this is one occasion when  they are being proactive in helping themselves and, at the same time, the  Department and the abattoirs. We have just heard that removing the  over-30-months scheme will save the agriculture industry money. The financial  saving should be a key element but not the main element in the matter&mdash; it is  the food-safety element that should be at the forefront of our minds. Such a  move would save the Department resources and money, and the abattoirs and the  farming community would also save money. Farmers are trying to be proactive in  that regard.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The removal of the scheme will also build confidence in the  rural and agricultural communities &mdash; and that confidence is desperately needed  at the moment, particularly in the beef industry. I am confident that the scheme  will be removed. However, I hope that when the process is under way, people &mdash;  especially the abattoir owners &mdash; will not ignore the new approach and instead  take the opportunity to reduce the price that they are paying to the farmer. To  act differently would be a travesty of justice. We must ensure that that does  not happen, if and when the over-30-month scheme is removed.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">As I said, the removal of the over-30-months scheme would  mean increased confidence within the local farming community, but it would also  lead to those in the wider European Union having greater confidence in our  industry. In turn, that would lead to greater access to our beef and other  products. I hope that progress can be made sooner rather than later. I have  heard what Members on the Benches opposite have said, and I am willing to let  the process takes its own course, if that is the way to do it. However, action  must be taken sooner rather than later; some urgency is needed.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Some Members have outlined how the experience of the past years  has affected farmers and the industry in general. The ban on cattle over 30  months old has had a huge effect on farmers, both financially and emotionally.  As Mr Poots said, that has proved catastrophic for some farmers, and they have  been driven to the point of suicide. That is something that we cannot  comprehend.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I am led to believe that raising the testing age limit from  30 months to 48 months would remove 40,000 cattle a year from the testing  system &mdash; I do not know how many more cattle would be removed if the age-limit  were raised to 60 months. However, such a move would help the farmer in  general. The entire farming industry is trying to move towards a more extensive  method of production, and farmers have been trying to intensify their methods  in general, especially in beef production &mdash; they have been trying to get their  cattle finished for beef before they reach 30 months. That has meant increased  costs in cereals and concentrates. If farmers could move to a more extensive  system, their input costs would be much lower.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Another serious issue is that abattoirs must kill cattle  under 30 months and those over 30 months on separate days. That has caused a  huge problem, which has, as Mr Poots mentioned, resulted in many cattle that  were perfectly fine for human consumption being thrown on skips or incinerated  over the years. I want to see an end to that practice. First and foremost, I  want to know that the health and safety of the consumer is kept at the  forefront of any decisions on the matter, and that more cost-effective methods  of production can be developed.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I support the motion, and I congratulate my colleagues Edwin Poots and Trevor  Clarke for highlighting the issue.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Oor fairmers ir unner sarious pressure tae rear baag bastes  at wul kill oot weill whiles steyin&rsquo; unner 30 montht oan account o&rsquo; the laa.

	        <p class="TimePeriod">5.00 pm</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Our farmers are under immense pressure to produce large  cattle that will provide a good side of meat before the age of 30 months, due  to the legislation. The EU is introducing legislation that will change that  limit to 48 months; that will relieve the strain a great deal. Farmers have  agreed with me that the Province needs to have the same rules as the rest of  the UK and Europe.  Our farmers produce superior beef. I come from Strangford in the heart of County Down,  where the grass is greener and, according to farmers, tastier. Our cattle  thrive faster, fatten quicker, look better and, most importantly, taste nicer.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">It is imperative that beef be free from BSE. However, that  does not mean that farms should be unreasonably and perpetually restricted. The  legislation in Northern    Ireland is too restrictive to allow a  flourishing farm to operate properly. The motion aims to help farmers to move  away from the problems that they have faced. The restrictions are now  unreasonable and unnecessary. The Minister needs to do what should have been  done a long time ago. She must loosen the rope and allow farmers to produce  superior meat, which is what they do best. With respect, not enough has been  done for our farming community or, indeed, our fishing community. I urge the  Minister to cut the farming community some slack and make life a little easier  for them without making meat any less safe. I support the motion.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development (Mr Murphy)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann  Comhairle. I welcome the opportunity to speak on behalf of the Minister of  Agriculture. I congratulate her on the birth of her daughter, and I am sure  that the Chairperson and members of the Agriculture Committee will send their  good wishes in due course.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">The European Commission recently agreed to increase the  minimum BSE testing age for all cattle to 48 months for member states that meet  the criteria for a revised BSE surveillance programme. DARD has policy  responsibility for BSE testing and introducing the necessary legislation.  However, we will not increase the minimum age for BSE-testing of cattle  slaughtered for human consumption without agreement from the Food Standards  Agency and the Department of Health.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Members may recall that the emergence of BSE came to a head  in March 1996, when it was concluded that the most likely explanation for new  variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in humans was exposure to BSE. Variant  CJD is a degenerative neurological disease, mainly in young adults, which  ultimately leads to premature death. Due to the risk of BSE infectivity in  meat, no cattle were allowed to enter the human food chain once they had  reached 30 months of age. All such animals were slaughtered and destroyed at  the end of their productive lives through the over-30-months scheme.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">In recognition of the significant strides that have been  taken &mdash; in Britain  and here &mdash; to eradicate BSE, the over-30-months rule was replaced by a BSE  testing regime in November 2005. For the first time since 1996, cattle over 30  months of age and born or reared in the UK on or after 1 August 1996 were  allowed to enter the food chain, subject to a negative test for BSE. That was  welcome news and opened up a new market for cattle older than 30 months.  However, the testing requirement placed additional logistical and financial  burdens on slaughterhouse operators and farmers.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">It is good news that the EU has now proposed that the  testing age of cattle for human consumption will increase from 30 months to 48  months from 1 January 2009. P J Bradley referred to the possibility of that age  limit increasing to 60 months. However, the EU discussed that and decided that  the testing age would be increased to 48 months and not 60 months.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">This change is welcome. It will reduce the financial and  operational burden on slaughterhouse operators and &mdash; as Tom Elliott mentioned &mdash;  lead to about 40,000 fewer cattle requiring BSE testing in the North of Ireland  before they can enter the food chain. However, Members will appreciate that  certain procedures must be followed before that can be implemented.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">In preparation for the age change for BSE testing, all  member states were asked to submit applications to the European Commission for  a revised BSE-testing programme. The UK application, which included  input from DARD, was submitted well in advance of the EU deadline of 1  September, and it was accepted by the EU expert group on 3 October. The  Commission has proposed a draft decision that would allow eligible member  states, including the UK,  to implement the revised programme from 1 January 2009.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">That draft decision was agreed by the EU Standing Committee  on Food Chain and Animal Health on Tuesday 14 October. The next, and possibly  last, stage at EU level is one month&rsquo;s scrutiny of the draft decision by the  European Parliament. If there are no objections, the new decision should be  published in the official journal in preparation for the commencement date of 1  January 2009.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">As I said earlier, in order to ensure that the public is  protected, we will not raise the minimum age for BSE testing for cattle  slaughtered for human consumption without a favourable opinion from the FSA and  Health Ministers. At the FSA board meeting on Wednesday 15 October, the board  considered the proposal to increase the age for BSE testing, taking into  account advice from the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC),  which is the independent body of scientists and experts that advises the  Government on BSE issues. SEAC advised that an increase in the age for BSE  testing for human consumption in cattle would represent a minimal-to-negligible  increase in the risk to human health. Edwin Poots mentioned that earlier.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">SEAC also emphasised the importance of appropriate BSE  surveillance in monitoring infection levels to ensure that they remain  extremely low. The FSA board supported the move to testing at 48 months, but it  does not wish that to be implemented until a further report on surveillance has  been produced and passed to SEAC for review.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">If the Health Ministers agree to the increase in the  BSE-testing age in the UK, DARD  will introduce an amendment to the Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies  Regulations (Northern    Ireland) 2006 to provide the legal basis to  increase the age for BSE testing of human-consumption cattle. Officials in DARD  will take that forward urgently with the FSA and health officials to ensure  that the necessary legislation is in place in line with the European Commission  timetable.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I encourage the Committee for Agriculture and Rural  Development to lend its full support to the draft legislation when it is  subject to scrutiny. That would greatly assist in the timely introduction of  the new BSE-testing age for human-consumption cattle. To introduce a new  BSE-testing age to the North of Ireland now, before the necessary European  legislation comes into force, would be a breach of the EU legal require to test  human-consumption cattle for BSE at 30 months of age.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Tom Elliott mentioned abattoirs. Abattoirs do not have to  kill under-30-month cattle on a different day from over-30-month cattle; they  can kill them on the same day, but at different times. Unfortunately, Mr  Elliott is not here, but I am sure that he will pick up my response to his  point in Hansard.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">William Irwin asked about further delays. DARD does not  intend to consult on the proposal to raise the BSE-testing age. The Food  Standards Agency has consulted widely in Britain and in the North of Ireland  to assess the views of stakeholders. The new BSE-testing age will be  incorporated into the draft TSE regulations, which were subject to a  consultation that ended on 26 September 2008.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">I can confirm that immediate steps are being taken to  ensure the introduction of the increased BSE-testing age of 48 months for  human-consumption cattle from 1 January 2009, subject to the necessary EU  legislation being in place and to the agreement of Health Ministers. However,  to stop BSE testing for healthy cattle over the age of 30 months that are  slaughtered for human consumption now would be in breach of EU regulations. Go  raibh maith agat.</p>
	        <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  It is difficult to speak after so many Members have spoken on the subject. Many  of them are farmers and, therefore, have a better knowledge of the issues than  I have. My colleague Edwin Poots asked me to sign the motion, which I had  pleasure in doing.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Those of us not from an agricultural background have not  been directly affected, but we have heard much about the subject, and I concur  with many of the remarks that have been made. Unsurprisingly, I am disappointed  by the Members from Sinn F&eacute;in. It sometimes appears that instead of protecting  the industry, they are protecting the Minister of Agriculture and Rural  Development. Pat Doherty said that the motion was futile; on the contrary, if  the motion had not been brought forward, the Minister might have done the same  as she has done with other topics that have been discussed by the Committee and  put the issue on the back burner.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Before and after taking office, for example, the Minister  had very different views about the Agricultural Wages Board. The industry is  crying out over the Rose Energy proposal, which the Minister now wants to make  the subject of a public inquiry. Those issues directly affect the agricultural  sector.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Last night, while pondering what I would say in the debate,  I wondered whether another &ldquo;A&rdquo; should be inserted into DARD&rsquo;s title, in order  to make it the &ldquo;Department against agriculture and rural development&rdquo;. As far  as I can ascertain, the Minister has not championed the industry at all.  However, I thank everyone who contributed to the debate for their positive  comments. If there were not so much scepticism about the Minister, there might  be less concern over whether the new measure will be introduced in January  2009.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	        <p class="B3BodyText">Resolved:</p>
