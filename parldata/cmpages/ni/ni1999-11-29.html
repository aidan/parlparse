                <p>&quot;By virtue of paragraph 1 of the schedule to the

                I hereby direct that the Assembly shall meet at Parliament
                Buildings, Stormont, at 2.30&nbsp;pm on

                <p>Within the last hour I have received from the Secretary of
                State a revision of a Standing Order. Although we have attempted
                to ensure that all Members have a copy, the short time available
                may have made that impossible. Since this pertains to the first
                substantive item of business after the Initial Presiding Officer’s
                business, I intend to suspend the sitting for 15&nbsp;minutes to
                enable Members to read the revised Standing Order. Copies have
                been placed in Members’ pigeon-holes, and more are available
                in the Members’ Lobby.</p>
                <i>
                <p>The sitting was suspended at 2.35&nbsp;pm and resumed at
                2.50&nbsp;pm.</p>
                </i><b>
                <p>The Initial Presiding Officer:</p>
                </b>
                <p>At the last sitting of the Assembly a number of issues arose
                on which I have to report and which have implications for this
                sitting.</p>
                <p>The first such matter arose during the conduct of d’Hondt.
                The question was this: what happens if a nominee for a
                ministerial position does not accept the nomination? Under the
                Act, it is clear that one moves on from that party but returns
                to it in the normal course of events. However, the Initial
                Standing Orders at that time did not take due account of the
                Act, and the refusal by a nominee to accept should, under those
                Standing Orders, have led to disregard of that party in
                subsequent rounds. I proceeded on the basis of the Act and not
                on the basis of the Initial Standing Orders, and Members have my
                full apology. The Secretary of State has seen fit to correct the
                anomaly. Should a nominee not accept a proposal, we will move on
                to the party whose turn is next — that in itself is a
                disadvantage — and the other party will be returned to in the
                subsequent rounds. Members will have seen this addressed in one
                of the two Standing Order determinations made by the Secretary
                of State at the end of last week.</p>
                <p>Another change to the Standing Orders last week referred to
                the order of precedence of business. As you know, we had a
                Standing Order which required that d’Hondt be the first item
                of business unless there was a competent motion for exclusion.
                That was the only thing that could take precedence. The
                Secretary of State has removed that Standing Order, and there is
                now no requirement for any particular order of precedence.</p>
                <p>In considering the order in which I should conduct business,
                I have taken account of what seems to be reasonable. If there is
                a competent motion for exclusion, it seems to me, it should take
                precedence over the running of d’Hondt, for if it were
                successful, d’Hondt would have to be rerun. Where business
                that is carried over from the previous sitting has implications
                for some of the rest of a day’s business it seems reasonable
                to deal with it first. Clearly there is business in relation to
                the position of Seamus&nbsp;Mallon, given that the last
                substantive item of business at the last sitting was the
                personal statement in which he tendered his resignation. The
                Secretary of State has addressed this matter in the Standing
                Order which was determined just before the commencement of this
                sitting and which I have given Members some time to&nbsp;read.</p>

                <p>The motion in the name of Mr&nbsp;Neeson also addresses this
                matter. Should the Assembly express its wish that Mr&nbsp;Mallon
                withdraw his offer of resignation, in accordance with the terms
                of Mr&nbsp;Neeson’s motion, the revised Standing Order would
                permit that, and it would be by majority vote unless anything
                else supervened. Some Members have only just had an opportunity
                to read this, but I trust that everyone is familiar with the
                terms set down.</p>
                <b>
                <p>Rev Dr Ian Paisley:</p>
                </b>
                <p>When we received the notice of today’s sitting it was a
                surprise to many Members to see the motion from Mr&nbsp;Neeson.
                It was quite clear at the last sitting that Mr&nbsp;Mallon did
                resign. The Secretary of State even mentioned it in the House of
                Commons and expressed the hope that another position would be
                available for him some day.</p>
                <p>I understand that all the facilities that accompany
                ministerial office — the things in which the press seem to
                most interested — were stripped from him. I have not made
                enquiry as to whether he lost his salary for that period, but I
                am sure that it too was stripped from him. However, on the Order
                Paper there is a motion which seems to ignore these facts. I
                remind Mr&nbsp;Neeson that in his speech at that time he
                referred to the resignation. It is quite clear that Mr&nbsp;Mallon
                did resign. It was reckoned to be a resignation by everyone in
                this House and in the Westminster Parliament.</p>
                <p>I now come to the amazing collusion involving this motion and
                the Secretary of State. A few minutes before this sitting
                commenced, the Secretary of State presented Members with an
                ultimatum. He can, of course, do that because he is able to
                change the Standing Orders. I am sure that he was tempted to
                prevent all those Members who oppose him from even entering this
                Building but thought that that would be too severe.</p>
                <p>By a dictatorial act he is seeking to give credence to this
                motion and to take away the right of the Assembly to have the
                First Minister and the Deputy First Minister elected together on
                the basis of the parallel consent that is written into the Act,
                under which a majority of those registered as Unionists must
                agree.</p>
                <p>Under this motion, those registered as Unionists will not be
                given the right to approve the reappointment of Mr&nbsp;Mallon
                on the terms on which he was first appointed. People talk about
                standing democracy on its head. This is democracy being stood on
                its head.</p>
                <p>Mr&nbsp;Initial&nbsp;Presiding Officer, I would like you to
                rule whether this motion is competent. Should its wording not be
                to the effect that the House accepts the Standing Orders and
                wishes them to be put into operation on this issue?</p>
                <b>
                <p>Mr McCartney:</p>
                </b>
                <p>Further to that point of order. The motion on the Order Paper
                refers to Mr&nbsp;Mallon’s &quot;offer of resignation&quot;
                and therefore requires some definition of when a resignation is
                a resignation. Mr&nbsp;Mallon told the House that his
                resignation would take immediate effect. I think that Mr&nbsp;Mallon
                would be the first to accept that with his resignation he
                accepted the loss of his emoluments. Seamus&nbsp;Mallon would
                not have continued to accept the emoluments of an office which
                he had vacated.</p>
                <p>Dr Paisley is correct. In the House of Commons the then
                Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Dr&nbsp;Mowlam,
                acknowledged the resignation with regret. There has been some
                suggestion that if the resignation was not in writing, and was
                not accepted in writing, it was not valid. Such a submission is
                without any legal validity. If the Standing Orders are silent on
                the manner in which a resignation must be offered or accepted,
                there is absolutely no requirement for the offer or the
                acceptance to be in writing.</p>
                <i>
                <p>3.00&nbsp;pm</p>
                </i>
                <p>I fear that we are back to Humpty-Dumpty. When Alice
                commented on the meaning of a word, he replied</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p>&quot;It means just what I choose it to mean — neither more
                nor less. The question is which is to be master — that’s
                all.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p>Are the Members in the Assembly to perform like Humpty-Dumpty,
                or are we to accept that a resignation — openly made before
                the Assembly and accepted by the Secretary of State in the House
                of Commons — is not a resignation? If that is the basis on
                which the proceedings of the Assembly are to continue, there is
                a grave question over the propriety of our procedures.</p>
                <p>It is not good enough that the Secretary of State, just
                minutes before the Assembly sits to discuss this matter,
                provides to some Members a Standing Order overturning one of the
                fundamental requirements on which this whole process has been
                built — the requirement for consensus. It specifically
                outlines that — different from all the other decisions made in
                the Assembly — the decision as to the choice of the First and
                Deputy First Ministers requires a majority of those designated
                as &quot;Unionist&quot; and a majority of those designated as
                &quot;Nationalist&quot;. For the Secretary of State to abolish
                with the stroke of a pen the fundamental and central principle
                of consensus for purposes of political expediency is a disgrace
                to this House.</p>
                <b>
                <p>The Initial Presiding Officer:</p>
                </b>
                <p>Let me respond to the points of order. First of all, it is
                clear that the Secretary of State has authority to determine
                Standing Orders. Whether or not Mr&nbsp;Mallon offered and, in
                fact, gave an effective resignation is more difficult to
                determine. I have no doubt that Mr&nbsp;Mallon, when he made his
                statement and tendered his resignation with immediate effect,
                believed that he was offering his resignation and that it was
                effective. It is quite clear from my response to Mr&nbsp;Mallon’s
                resignation that I too believed that to be the case. It seemed
                to me a matter of common sense. However, the validity of
                Mr&nbsp;Mallon’s resignation is a matter of law and not of
                common sense.</p>
                <p>I did not have an opportunity to seek legal advice prior to
                Mr&nbsp;Mallon’s statement, but I&nbsp;did seek advice after
                the sitting. During the sitting I was asked various questions,
                notably by Mr&nbsp;Robinson. The Member asked if the resignation
                had to be given in writing and, if so, whether I had a copy of
                it. I&nbsp;said that there was no Standing Order requiring a
                written resignation. The resignation would be recorded in
                Hansard — and only there.</p>
                <p>Mr&nbsp;Robinson asked what were the Standing Orders dealing
                with a resignation. I did not answer the question as I&nbsp;knew
                that while there were such Standing Orders, they applied only in
                a post-devolution situation. Having sought legal advice,
                I&nbsp;was told that one could not be sure that the offer of
                resignation, though made in good faith, was effective as there
                was not a Standing Order addressing the matter.</p>
                <p>Subsequent legal advice took different turns. Some advocates
                agreed with the initial advice, while others stated that the
                resignation was full and complete as it was given in good faith
                and was recognised by others. In these circumstances, it seems
                to me, there were only two or three possible courses of action.
                I could have sought a judicial review on my own behalf to
                clarify the matter. I readily admit that the circumstances were
                unusual, but it would have been most unusual to seek a judicial
                review not on something that had been done but on questions that
                were incompletely answered. Others, of course, could have sought
                a judicial review in regard to the matter, but that was not
                something for me.</p>
                <p>When I was presented with a motion, the question was whether
                it was competent, in particular when it appeared on the Order
                Paper, as distinct from subsequently, the new Standing Order
                having been put in place. The advice that I received was that by
                determining that it was not competent I would have been taking a
                particular legal view in terms of the actions that had been
                taken. I would, in that sense, have been acting as though I were
                a court, and that would not be appropriate. Therefore I had no
                option but to accept as competent the motion that was given,
                have it put on the Order Paper and see how things turned out.</p>
                <p>You now have a Standing Order that makes the motion not only
                competent but relevant. That is clearly so. Whether the position
                is satisfactory from a legal point of view is not a matter for
                me. This is not a court, and whether others seek confirmation is
                up to them.</p>
                <p>That is the clearest and fullest answer I can give.</p>
                <b>
                <p>Mr P Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p>On a point of order, Mr Initial Presiding Officer. Have you
                sought legal advice on this issue? When the resignation took
                place on 15&nbsp;July the rules were clear. The Deputy First
                Minister (Designate) had been elected by a certain mechanism. He
                resigned with immediate effect. The resignation was confirmed at
                Westminster, every newspaper in the country covered it, people
                in their tens of thousands watched it on television, and
                Mr&nbsp;Mallon came on afterwards to explain his reason for
                resigning. It was complete and final. There was no doubt in
                anybody’s mind.</p>
                <p>This is an ex post facto change in the rules. How can it
                apply to a past situation? I could well understand it if the
                Secretary of State did not like the rules under which the
                Assembly had been set up and wanted to change them. I would be
                unhappy about that, but a retrospective change is worse. If Mr
                Mallon had resigned with the new Initial Standing Orders in
                place the procedure would have been straightforward, but that is
                not the case.</p>
                <b>
                <p>Mr McCartney:</p>
                </b>
                <p>It is a well-established principle that any office which
                includes the provision of personal services, as the Office of
                First Minister does, is not subject in the courts to a mandatory
                injunction that it perform them. That is the rule for the
                simplest of reasons: the law and the courts implementing it do
                nothing in vain, and it is impossible to compel any office or
                contract that involves personal services. Even the Queen may
                abdicate. No principle that I am aware of could possibly
                validate the retrospective withdrawal of a resignation
                legitimately given and accepted at the time by the Members of
                this Assembly, who were all present, and by the then Secretary
                of State.</p>
                <p>There is deep suspicion — confirmed by what
                Mr&nbsp;Robinson has said — that there are no rules in the
                Assembly by which we will abide. There are only the rules
                governed by the will of the Secretary of State. Everyone knows
                that if there were a rerun of the process it would be impossible
                for the First Minister (Designate) to be elected — and he and
                his Deputy must stand together to get a majority. This is an
                example — the most obvious and profane example — of
                executive power undercutting democratic procedure and principle,
                and it should be refused.</p>
                <b>
                <p>Rev Dr Ian Paisley:</p>
                </b>
                <p>Mr&nbsp;Initial&nbsp;Presiding Officer, there is another
                matter on which I would like you to rule. Is it right to demand
                of this Assembly, by motion, something that is not accurate?
                There was more than an offer of resignation; there was
                acceptance. Everyone knows that it was accepted — right up to
                the highest court in the land, the Westminster Parliament. The
                new Standing Order is inaccurate in that it ignores the fact
                that the resignation was accepted. The words &quot;has
                offered&quot; do not deal with the fact that it was accepted and
                acted upon, with every &quot;i&quot; dotted and every
                &quot;t&quot; crossed.</p>
                <p>I understand that Mr&nbsp;Mallon had to get somebody to take
                him home because his official car had been taken from him
                immediately. Surely, Mr Initial Presiding Officer, we should not
                be asked, by you or anyone else, to debate a motion the terms of
                which are not factually correct.</p>
                <b>
                <p>The Initial Presiding Officer:</p>
                </b>
                <p>I do not want to go over the same ground again and again, but
                I shall do my best to clarify matters, even if my clarification
                is not appealing or acceptable.</p>
                <p>There is no doubt that the Secretary of State has the right
                to determine Standing Orders as he chooses, even if people
                disagree with or despise them. I cannot gainsay that right; it
                is my responsibility to implement the rules as set down.</p>
                <p>If the Assembly were to adopt a resolution mandating me to
                express a particular view on its behalf I would be quite content
                to do so. However, I could not put forth a view simply because
                it was the view of a number of Assembly Members. The Secretary
                of State has a right to do these things, and there is no point
                in our going round the houses with regard to them.</p>
                <p>I have expressed the belief that Mr&nbsp;Mallon was clear in
                his own mind that he was tendering his resignation with
                immediate effect, and subsequent events may have tended to
                confirm that for him. My immediate response, which I described
                as being made on the hoof, was based on common sense rather than
                on the law.</p>
                <i>
                <p>3.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p>Legal views that were expressed subsequently and others that
                we have just heard make it clear that common sense and the law
                are not necessarily the same. Doctors differ and lawyers differ,
                but the consequences are not the same. It is clear, therefore,
                that I must take the best advice. Of course, a court might judge
                that it was not the best advice. It would be exceptional to
                prejudge this by going to court, and after consideration I
                decided not to do so, though others may take that course.</p>
                <p>Mr Robinson asked if there were Standing Orders dealing with
                the matter of resignation. The immediate answer, had I been able
                to respond at the time, would have been no. However, I studied
                the matter to make sure that I was right. Had there been such
                Standing Orders at the time, and had the Secretary of State
                changed them, there would be more substance in the Member’s
                point. In the absence of such provision, the Secretary of State
                has put in place Standing Orders which address the matter.</p>
                <p>This is not an ex post facto matter; it is a question of
                closing a gaping hole. It must have seemed so to
                Mr&nbsp;Robinson, given the speed with which he pointed out that
                there were no relevant Standing Orders. It is clear that there
                will be differences of opinion. Following the last sitting, it
                is apparent to me that there are differing legal views on the
                issue and that there is no way to resolve the differences. I had
                to make a decision, and I have given my ruling as clearly as I
                can. I do not want to stop people responding, but neither do I
                want to go over the same ground again and again. Of course,
                Members will have an opportunity to express their views on the
                motion. I propose that if we get to that stage the normal
                procedure be followed. That would give Members a couple of hours
                to have their say.</p>
                <p>It is very difficult for me to keep ruling on the same points
                of order — and not profitable.</p>
                <b>
                <p>Mr&nbsp;McCartney:</p>
                </b>
                <p>Further to that point of order, Mr Presiding Officer. The
                response you have given is informative but tangential. No one
                questions the right of the Secretary of State to make a Standing
                Order, but the Standing Order which he has made refers, as
                Dr&nbsp;Paisley has pointed out, to an offer of resignation. So
                if you are going to apply this Standing Order, it must be
                applied not to a de facto and fully effective resignation but to
                an offer of resignation. The issue is not the power of the
                Secretary of State; it is whether, in the terms of the Standing
                Order so lately delivered, the resignation of Mr&nbsp;Mallon,
                complete in every way, can be treated as an offer of
                resignation.</p>
                <p>A sovereign power — and this includes the delegated powers
                of the Secretary of State under statute — can do many things,
                but we come back to a question that was put to
                Sir&nbsp;Thomas&nbsp;More when he was asked to subscribe to the
                Act of Supremacy. Referring to the absolute sovereignty of
                Parliament, he said to the then Attorney-General</p>

                <p>I pose this question: can the Secretary of State turn a

                in the times of Sir&nbsp;Thomas&nbsp;More.</p>

                <p>I am advised that the offer, which was made with full
                integrity and in the expectation that it would be effective, may
                not have been more than an offer, although it may have been
                deemed to be otherwise.</p>

                <p>We should not move to the motion quite so quickly. By
                concentrating on whether or not a man can be turned into a
                woman, we are losing sight of one or two things. Mr&nbsp;Mallon
                resigned when he gave his resignation to the House. There is

                <p>Let us not keep going over this question of the offer of

                </font><font SIZE="1">

                <p>I can only judge what is most appropriate, based on the
                advice that I am given. If Members or others feel that they have
                a proper case to take and wish to seek guidance elsewhere, it
                would be entirely proper for them to do so. However, we should

                in the name of Mr&nbsp;Neeson, even though you were not able to
                say whether it was competent. Is that not an amazing statement?
                Surely it is necessary for you, as Presiding Officer, to ensure
                that any motion on the Order Paper is competent at the time of
                tabling, rather than hope that it will become competent.</p>

                did not say that I was unable to judge whether the motion was
                competent; I said that it was not possible for me to rule that
                it was not competent. If something is clearly not competent it
                will not be allowed through. If I had ruled that this motion was
                not competent I would have been making an alternative legal
                determination which I did not believe I was entitled to make. In
                that context, it is appropriate to allow it to go forward as
                competent until proven otherwise. In another situation it might
                be clearly incompetent, and in that case it would be ruled out.</p>

                <p>Mr Initial Presiding Officer, you have stated that you have
                received conflicting legal advice from two quarters. It seems to
                me that there is no pressing requirement for you to prefer what
                has come from one of them if you are left in limbo. And it is
                equally wrong for you to take the view that it is for individual
                Members, or any group of Members, to seek a court decision on
                this issue. It is for the House, through you, to seek that
                decision.</p>
                <p>It would be quite wrong to allow this to proceed on the basis
                that there may be a subsequent court action or construction
                summons rendering, or possibly rendering, nugatory all that
                takes place here. Surely prevention is better than cure. The
                proper course is to take legal advice — not judicial advice
                — as to whether or not this is in order and to act upon it. It
                is wrong to throw upon the Members of the Assembly, or any group
                of them, the responsibility to do what your Office ought to do.</p>

                <p>The Initial Presiding Officer:</p>
                </b>
                <p>First of all, I did not seek a whole array of legal advice. I
                sought my own legal advice, but other legal views were drawn to
                my attention. That is where the uncertainty arose. It was not
                other advice that I sought. I am not putting it onto individual
                Members. If the Assembly as a whole were to request me to seek
                advice, of course I would do so. I asked for advice for myself,
                and, having received it, I am making the best judgements I can.
                It is clear that other legal minds have been at work and have
                come up with a range of views as to precisely what has been
                going on here. I have to make my own judgement and move ahead as
                best I can.</p>

                <p>That is not a point of order. I have already ruled that it is
                not a question of what Mr&nbsp;Mallon believed himself to be
                doing — that is clear. It is a question of law and of making a
                judgement under Standing Orders.</p>

                <p>May I draw attention to annex&nbsp;C of the Code of Conduct
                and to part&nbsp;A of the Initial Standing Orders, which state
                that all Ministers, including the Deputy First Minister
                (Designate), must observe the highest standards of propriety,
                regularity and integrity. If the action that the Secretary of
                State has proposed is agreed, how will that meet these criteria
                and the code of conduct requirement for the highest standard of
                integrity? What does Mr&nbsp;Mallon fear? [Interruption]</p>
                <b>
                <p>The Initial Presiding Officer:</p>
                </b>
                <p>Order. When raising points regarding the integrity of others,
                Members need to be very careful. Those who operate in other
                places will know just how careful. Lest there be any doubt, I
                repeat that this is not about the integrity of Mr&nbsp;Mallon.
                It is clear that he believed that he was fully and completely
                resigning. The question is whether the law in that regard was
                complete. It is clear from the questions that have been raised
                that the Standing Orders were not adequate to deal with the
                matter.</p>
                <p>We now need to discuss whether the Assembly wishes to operate
                on the basis of the new Standing Order and request a different
                outcome, and that means that we must proceed to the motion
                standing the name of Mr Neeson.</p>
                <b>
                <p>Mr Neeson:</p>
                </b>
                <p>I beg to move the following motion:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p>That this Assembly wishes, notwithstanding his offer of
                resignation as Deputy First Minister (Designate), that Seamus&nbsp;Mallon&nbsp;MP
                hold office as Deputy First Minister (Designate).</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p>We have talked about the democratic process. A major purpose
                in my introducing this motion is to ensure that the will of the
                people is carried out in accordance with the result of the
                referendum in Northern&nbsp;Ireland last year. I want to see the
                full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
                <p>This is the first sitting of the Assembly since 15&nbsp;July,
                when Seamus&nbsp;Mallon stated</p>

                <p>&quot;I wish to inform the Assembly that, accordingly, I

                <p>Many of us shared his frustration about the lack of progress
                in implementing the Good Friday Agreement and the failure to
                elect the Executive. Since then a great deal has happened,
                including the welcome success of Senator&nbsp;Mitchell’s
                review.</p>
                <p>We have the greatest opportunity now to establish an
                inclusive, power-sharing Executive and thereby fulfil the
                responsibility with which we were charged by the vast majority
                of people in Northern&nbsp;Ireland when they voted in the
                referendum.</p>
                <p>This sitting is the first real opportunity to consider
                Mr&nbsp;Mallon’s offer of resignation. Support for the motion
                will allow us to move forward and create the Executive. It will
                also lead to the setting up of the necessary scrutiny
                Committees, thus giving Northern&nbsp;Ireland accountable
                democracy, ending the democratic deficit that the people have
                endured for 25&nbsp;years.</p>
                <p>I organised an all-party meeting this morning to discuss with
                the Economy Minister, John&nbsp;McFall, the matter of extending
                the natural-gas pipeline to other areas of
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland.</p>

                <p>On a point of order, Mr&nbsp;Initial Presiding Officer. The
                Member referred in the last debate in the House to &quot;the
                former Deputy First Minister&quot;. He kept saying &quot;the
                former&quot;. Is it in order for him now to try to tell the
                House that Mr&nbsp;Mallon is not the former Deputy First
                Minister but was just offering his resignation?</p>

                <b>
                <p>The Initial Presiding Officer:</p>
                </b>
                <p>It is in order for all of us to live and learn.</p>
                <b>
                <p>Mr Neeson:</p>
                </b>
                <p>From the Democratic Unionist Party’s conference last
                weekend one can only conclude that they have not learned a lot.</p>
                <p>Mr&nbsp;John&nbsp;McFall has been a very good Northern
                Ireland Office Minister, but from Thursday morning a Member of
                this Assembly will have that responsibility, and it would be
                appropriate to thank all the Westminster Ministers for their
                time and effort during the long years of direct rule.</p>
                <p>It is implicit in Senator&nbsp;Mitchell’s review that the
                process of decommissioning illegal paramilitary arms will begin,
                and the vast majority of people in Northern&nbsp;Ireland take
                the view that this must involve all paramilitary groups. That is
                why a vote for the motion is so important. A positive vote would
                lead to the establishment of the North/South bodies as outlined
                in Mr&nbsp;Trimble’s and Mr&nbsp;Mallon’s report of
                15&nbsp;February. I also hope that an early start will be made
                to the appointment of the Civic Forum. And the establishment of
                the Executive will herald the end of the Anglo-Irish
                secretariat, set up under the aegis of the Anglo-Irish
                Agreement. We will also see changes in articles&nbsp;2
                and&nbsp;3 of the Republic of Ireland’s constitution, which
                laid claim to Northern&nbsp;Ireland.</p>
                <p>On the radio this morning I heard the sincere pleas of a
                representative of the Ulster Farmers’ Union. He urged the
                Assembly to move forward so that local representatives would be
                dealing with the current dire situation.</p>
                <p>The way ahead will not be easy, but if politicians really
                want to see progress they must grasp the opportunity that is
                before us today.</p>
                <p>On 15&nbsp;July I stated that there were no victors — only
                losers — as a result of what had happened that day. I firmly
                believe that there will be many winners today, and they will be
                the people of Northern&nbsp;Ireland — young and old, and from
                every community.</p>
                <b>
                <p>The First Minister (Designate) (Mr&nbsp;Trimble):</p>
                </b>
                <p>I do not intend to say very much, for I am sure that the
                press and the visitors here today have come for business that is
                further down the Order Paper, and we all want to get to that as
                quickly as possible. We certainly do not want to see a
                repetition of the interminable points of order that were
                intended to delay the proceedings.</p>
                <p>On behalf of the Ulster Unionist Party I am very happy to
                support Mr&nbsp;Neeson’s motion. We very much want to see the
                team reconstituted and Mr&nbsp;Mallon back in office, as
                handling business over the last few months has been most
                inconvenient. In the light of developments over recent weeks and
                months I am sure that Mr&nbsp;Mallon will be glad, in the
                changed circumstances, to come back. I am tempted to go back
                over some of the points of order, particularly some very poorly
                argued legal points that were not, in my view, accurate, but I
                shall not do so.</p>
                <b>
                <p>Mr Mallon:</p>
                </b>
                <p>On 15&nbsp;July I asked for the leave of the Assembly to make
                a personal statement about my position as Deputy First Minister
                (Designate). I said</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p>&quot;The key element of the pledge of office taken by the
                First Minister and myself was our commitment to work in good
                faith to bring into being the arrangements set out in the Good
                Friday Agreement.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p>I informed the Assembly that I was offering my resignation as
                Deputy First Minister (Designate) in the belief that this was
                the only way to ensure</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p>&quot;that a meaningful review of all aspects of the
                agreement will be carried out and that, subsequent to that, a
                fully inclusive Executive can be created&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p>Those were my words of 15&nbsp;July to the Assembly. Since
                then, quite obviously, I have not acted at Deputy First Minister
                (Designate). As a result of the events of 15&nbsp;July —
                inside and outside the Chamber — and for many other reasons,
                Senator&nbsp;Mitchell was asked to carry out a review of the
                agreement. My colleagues and I in the SDLP participated fully in
                that review without office or benefit of title, as I said we
                would. The review was meaningful and successful.</p>
                <p>What was sought on 15&nbsp;July, so far as I was concerned,
                was achieved. All pro-agreement parties have fully endorsed the
                way through the impasse over decommissioning and the formation
                of the institutions, as proposed by Senator&nbsp;Mitchell. We
                expect all parties to honour those commitments in relation to
                both the institutions and decommissioning. For me, the
                implementation of the agreement was then, and is now, the only
                motivation. It is, for me, the enduring imperative.</p>
                <p>This motion is not about me, either as a politician or as a
                person. It is not about any individual. It is about the
                agreement, and it is my conviction that I will do, and have
                done, everything in my power to ensure that the agreement will
                work, with all its requirements met and institutions set up. I
                repeat: this is not about me personally but about the workings
                of the agreement. Today we are called upon, as the collective
                body of the political process in Northern&nbsp;Ireland, to put
                in place the institutions — called upon by the agreement and
                the Pledge of Office that Ministers will take subsequently;
                called upon by our agreement to the Mitchell review; and called
                upon in the referendum by the people of Ireland, North and
                South.</p>
                <p>Putting the institutions in place requires resolving the
                issue of the joint offices of the First and Deputy First
                Ministers. I repeat: the issue is not about personalities, who
                they may be, or which political party might serve in those
                offices, but about the requirement to put the institutions in
                place. Without that, there is no way forward. D’Hondt will not
                be operative, and devolution cannot occur. In July last year the
                Assembly bestowed on the First Minister, David&nbsp;Trimble, and
                me the honour — I regarded it as an honour then, and I still
                do — of appointment to the positions of First and Deputy First
                Ministers (Designate).</p>
                <p>On 15&nbsp;July&nbsp;1999 I offered my position as Deputy
                First Minister (Designate) — not to a Secretary of State, not
                on a piece of paper, not to the media, but on the Floor of this
                Assembly, to this Assembly, because it was this Assembly that
                appointed me to that office. Whatever views one might have about
                my motivation and about what the impact might have been, I came
                to the Assembly, to the people who had elected me as Deputy
                First Minister (Designate), and offered my resignation to them.
                With regard to the Secretary of State’s Standing Order and
                this motion, these people, the Members of the Assembly, will
                decide their response. It will be the response not of Seamus&nbsp;Mallon
                or of any individual but of the Assembly.</p>
                <p>Before the Assembly makes that response I want to make my
                position clear. The imperative for me is the implementation of
                the agreement. I have made it clear to the First Minister
                (Designate) and to the Secretary of State that the working of
                the institutions requires a sufficient level of support. It is
                now for the Assembly to decide and indicate that level of
                support.</p>
                <p>May I remind Members (as if it had not been ingrained in us)
                that we have had 601&nbsp;days of negotiation since the Good
                Friday Agreement was made — 601&nbsp;days of almost continuous
                negotiation. For that period we have had this lacuna, this gap
                in the political process. Now we have an opportunity to create
                the inclusive Executive, the North/South Ministerial Council,
                the British/Irish Council, the Civic Forum — all those
                institutions. Can anybody rationally suggest that I, who offered
                my resignation to the Assembly as the only way I saw at that
                time to protect this agreement, would stand in the way of the
                creation of those institutions?</p>
                <p>At a personal level, and as a member of a party that has
                struggled for 30&nbsp;years to bring about power-sharing and a
                meaningful all-Ireland institution, I regard this as a landmark
                day. I feel, and my party feels, a special responsibility for
                the success of these institutions. We are determined to work
                with all our Colleagues — and I mean all our Colleagues — in
                the Assembly for all our people. Today the hard work of creating
                that new future can begin. But it is not in my hands; it is a
                decision of the Assembly, and, as a democrat, I think that that
                is only right. I await the decision of the Assembly.</p>

                </i><b>
                <p>Mr P Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p>Mr Mallon reminds us of 601&nbsp;days during which we have
                not had one detonator; 601&nbsp;days, and not one ounce of
                Semtex; 601&nbsp;days, and not one bullet; 601&nbsp;days, and
                not one gun. That is how valuable the negotiations have been.</p>
                <p>I am glad, however, that he said that this is not a personal
                issue. I am glad because I would have had more enthusiasm if it
                had been about someone central to the issue for whom I had less
                respect. But it is a key and vital issue, as he himself says.
                The first matter that the Assembly needs to look at is whether
                the motion can trigger the Standing Order. It was clearly
                designed to have that effect. However, you, Mr Initial Presiding
                Officer, in particular will have to satisfy yourself that it
                does.</p>
                <p>It has already been said that the motion indicates that there
                was an offer of resignation. If it was only an offer of
                resignation, even though the Standing Order asks us to allow it
                to have prior effect, clearly you may so rule. However, if you
                judge that it was not simply an offer of resignation but a full
                and complete resignation, the Standing Order does not have
                effect and cannot be used in this context.</p>
                <p>The first step that the Assembly has to take is to determine
                whether there was an offer of resignation or an actual
                resignation. The best way of deciding that is to look at
                Mr&nbsp;Mallon’s words. In parliamentary terms I cannot call
                anyone a liar, and I would not do so. However, I wonder whether
                it is parliamentary to indicate that someone has told a
                half-truth. Mr&nbsp;Neeson was careful to read only part of the
                sentence that Mr&nbsp;Mallon used. I will read all of it.
                Mr&nbsp;Mallon said — and this is the sentence which was
                quoted by Mr&nbsp;Neeson —</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p>&quot;It is now necessary that I resign as Deputy First
                Minister. I wish to inform the Assembly that, accordingly, I
                offer my resignation ...&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p>(so far as Mr&nbsp;Neeson is concerned, there is a full stop
                here, but in fact there is not)</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p>&quot;with immediate effect.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p>Then he said — and this is vital —</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p>&quot;It was this Assembly that elected me to that position,
                and it is essential that I announce my resignation&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p>(not &quot;my offer of resignation&quot; but &quot;my
                resignation&quot; )</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p>&quot;to the Assembly.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p>Confirming that it was a resignation, the Secretary of State
                rose in the House of Commons at 12.30&nbsp;pm on the same day
                and made the following statement:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p>&quot;The House will be as sad as I am to hear that the
                Deputy First Minister designate of Northern Ireland, the hon.
                Member for Newry and Armagh (Mr&nbsp;Mallon), has just
                resigned.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p>She said not that he has offered his resignation but that he
                had resigned. It is very clear that at the moment of this
                resignation the writers of Initial Standing Orders and the
                Secretary of State were satisfied that it was a resignation. The
                Secretary of State was so satisfied that it was a resignation
                that she was prepared to go to the Dispatch Box in the House of
                Commons and announce that it had taken place. Clearly it was not
                simply an offer of resignation. It was confirmed by Mr Mallon
                and the Secretary of State that it was a full-blown resignation.</p>
                <p>If it was an offer of resignation very little will have
                happened until this moment. However, if it was a resignation
                there will have been consequences. First, did Mr&nbsp;Mallon
                continue to receive his salary? Secondly, were the trappings of
                office taken from him? Everyone knows that his car was taken,
                and I think that the fax machine was pulled out of his house.
                Certainly his offices and staff were taken away, and his salary
                was stopped. Is that what is done when someone offers his
                resignation? That is what is done when someone has resigned and
                his resignation has been accepted as final. There cannot be the
                slightest doubt that this was a full-blown and accepted
                resignation.</p>
                <p>If this was the case, under the Standing Orders which applied
                then, and which apply today, there is a requirement for a
                reappointment, a re-election. That is the heart of the issue.
                All this chicanery is for one purpose. The mechanism for getting
                Mr&nbsp;Mallon, or whoever else it might be, back into office is
                an absurd voting system. It is a voting system that the
                Democratic Unionist Party had nothing to do with.</p>
                <p>Indeed, it is a voting system devised to help people on the
                other side of the House in case Unionists gang up with one
                another and have a majority. So they decided to have a
                consensus-based voting system which required majorities on both
                sides. A parallel vote was required whereby a majority of both
                Unionists and Nationalists, so designated in this House, was
                needed to approve the appointment of the new Deputy First
                Minister (Designate) or the re-appointment of the former one.
                Could they have achieved that? As everybody knows, the
                realpolitik is that they could not.</p>
                <p>The best they could have achieved would have been an equal
                number of designated Unionists, something like 29 to 29.
                However, that would not have been a majority. Alternatively,
                members of the Women’s Coalition might have designated
                themselves as Unionists, but, as everyone knows, the Member for
                South&nbsp;Belfast does not have a Unionist corpuscle in her
                veins. She would have been hypocritical had she designated
                herself as a Unionist. The reality is that if they had not been
                able to get that through, the whole process would have come to
                an end.</p>
                <p>I do not entirely agree with Mr&nbsp;Mallon and his view that
                the running of d’Hondt to appoint the Ministers could not have
                taken place. I believe that it could. It would not, however,
                have had any effect, because the First Minister (Designate)
                could not himself have called the Executive together, since it
                is a joint decision. We do not have a Prime Minister as such. We
                have a First Minister (Designate) and a Deputy First Minister
                (Designate) who are joined at the hip. They cannot take
                independent decisions. They must act together, in accordance
                with the legislation. Without their both having been present,
                there could never have been a meeting of the
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland Executive, hence the dilemma. Under the
                rules, we cannot get Seamus back, and we cannot call an
                Executive together unless we do. What is the answer? Let us
                change the rules.</p>
                <p>They wrote the rules; they decided that they would frame
                those rules to ensure that they would win, and now that they
                have discovered they cannot, they decide that the rules must be
                changed. It does no credit to the person in question that he
                should be elected as a lesser Minister, a Minister for
                loopholes, a Minister elected by the back door. Indeed, one
                might even refer to him as a Minister who is being asked to
                slither under the door. What honour is there in being elected by
                a procedure other than the proper one which everyone recognised
                was required? First they duck and dodge the rules and then they
                change them.</p>
                <p>I do not believe that those who support this agreement would
                want Seamus&nbsp;Mallon to gain office by some shabby, back-door
                trickery. That would demean their cause. They should face up to
                the reality. If on day one they do not have the numbers to get
                this through, how long will they allow this farce, this charade,
                to continue?</p>
                <b>
                <p>Mr Adams:</p>
                </b>
                <p>Tá mé ag labhairt i leith an rúin, agus tá mé an-sásta
                sin a dhéanamh. The last time we were in this Chamber I
                remember thinking that, collectively, we were facing the most
                difficult crisis of this process to date. The most visible
                manifestation of that was the collapse of the Executive within
                minutes of its being formed and the Deputy First Minister
                (Designate), Seamus&nbsp;Mallon’s subsequent offer of
                resignation.</p>
                <p>At that time, I paid tribute to Mr Mallon, and Sinn Féin
                decided to support him because, in our view, he had no choice.
                Today, we want to support the motion that the Deputy First
                Minister (Designate) should continue to hold that office. I am
                very touched by the DUP’s concern for him, as, I am sure, is
                he. This is the same DUP who tried to silence him and prevent
                him from making his statement in July. The difference between
                July and today is that there is now an opportunity for the full
                implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. It is time for all
                of us to move forward in a spirit of partnership, inclusiveness
                and camaraderie, and this motion gives us the opportunity to do
                that.</p>
                <p>The words &quot;historic&quot;, &quot;momentous&quot; and
                &quot;new beginning&quot; have often been used to describe
                pivotal points in the development — the very slow development
                — of the peace process. Nevertheless, the Mitchell review
                represents a watershed in our recent history. Making this work
                will require all of us to reshape the political context in which
                we live. Sinn Féin is very proud to stand in the tradition of
                the Presbyterians — the truly &quot;free&quot; Presbyterians
                — of the 1790s, who fought for liberty, equality and
                fraternity. Our goal remains the establishment of a united, free
                and independent Ireland. We believe that the Good Friday
                Agreement is a transitional structure that will allow us to
                achieve that legitimate objective. Others in this Assembly hold
                the opposite view — that is fair enough — but there is now
                the possibility for all of us to pursue our different and
                opposing political goals in partnership, as equals, in mutual
                respect and toleration.</p>
                <p>Opponents of this motion — and no one here is deceived by
                the legalistic bombast — are opposed to progress of all sorts.
                At least Peter&nbsp;Robinson is almost frank enough to admit
                this: he asks how much longer the Assembly and these
                institutions will continue to survive. But what have they got to
                offer ordinary people outside the sectional, sectarian element
                they have sought to lead astray over the years? What vision of
                the future do they have to offer? The rejectionists have, to
                date, had their way, it could be claimed, in pursuance of their
                objective of impeding progress. It would be fair to say that
                they have not done too badly. There have been 600-odd days of
                preventing forward movement. But here, this afternoon, we might
                see the beginning of an end to all that, the beginning of an end
                to all the reluctance, hesitancy, begrudging and naysaying. We
                can commence our new future.</p>
                <p>I want to work not just with the UUP, the SDLP, the Alliance
                Party, the Women’s Coalition and the PUP, but also with the
                DUP. Unionists have nothing to fear from sharing power with
                Irish Republicans, because our future is bound up together. Our
                future is the concern and responsibility of each of us — as
                individuals, political leaders and parties, governments,
                communities, organisations and businesses. The engine at the
                core of this will dictate the pace of events, and it will have
                to ensure that a new partnership of equals is created. There
                must be open, transparent and accountable government — a
                people-centred government — interlocked with and
                interdependent on the North/South Ministerial Councils and the
                policy implementation bodies. These institutions have to be
                owned by and be responsible to the people — not the Unionist
                people, or the Republican people, or the Nationalist people, or
                the people of the North or of the South, but all the people.</p>
                <p>That is the challenge. For too long in this statelet, the
                no-men have had it easy. I appeal to Dr&nbsp;Paisley once again,
                as he goes into the twilight of his life and his career, to
                reflect not on the past but on the future. A future that will be
                a new future for the children of this nation. I call upon the
                Assembly to support the motion that Seamus&nbsp;Mallon hold
                Office as Deputy First Minister (Designate). Go raibh maith
                agaibh.</p>

                </b>
                <p>My party will not be supporting this proposal. Furthermore, I
                wish to reject the suggestion that Mr&nbsp;Neeson made today
                that the majority of decent, law-abiding citizens in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland support the placing in government of those
                fronting terrorist organisations. What is taking place in this
                House today has nothing to do with the outworking of the
                expression of the will of the people of this Province; it has
                come about as a result of a programme driven by lies and
                deception and designed to subvert the will of the majority
                community in Northern&nbsp;Ireland. For this plan to succeed,
                the Northern&nbsp;Ireland Office required a Unionist leader who
                could deliver a sizeable section of the pro-Union community.
                Enter, stage left, Mr&nbsp;David Trimble, leader of the Ulster
                Unionist Party, and his two bit players, Ms&nbsp;McWilliams, and
                Mr&nbsp;David&nbsp;Ervine of the Progressive Unionist Party,
                plus a cast of hundreds of church leaders and so-called captains
                of industry. They are all puppets dancing to the tune of the
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland Office, choreographed —</p>

                which he leads today that he does not have a mandate to do what
                he is currently doing in this House.</p>

                <p>&quot;now I have lived to see every one of the safeguards
                absolutely set to naught and made useless. This is not a
                pleasant political career. I belong, I believe, to what is
                called the Unionist party. Why it is called the Unionist party I
                fail to understand, unless it is to remind people in this
                country that it was the party which betrayed the Union.&quot;</p>

                <p>Those words apply today as I address the Members from the
                Ulster Unionist Party — a party that, if it moves to elect
                Sinn Féin Members as Ministers, will finally have betrayed the
                people who elected its members to this Assembly. Mr Trimble has
                left a trail of broken promises over the past weeks and months.
                Today we shall see what most people, even a few short months
                ago, would have believed unthinkable: the seating in government
                of those who have terrorised this community over the last thirty
                years. Think of Mr&nbsp;Adams and of the movement that brought

                been responsible for the deaths of thousands of citizens,
                Catholic and Protestant, for the maiming of tens of thousands
                and for destroying countless homes. That is the vision that
                Mr&nbsp;Adams has had for the last 30&nbsp;years. I take it very
                ill that he chides Members about visions for the future. His
                vision for the last 30&nbsp;years has been pregnant women lying
                on the streets of this Province with their stomachs open, with
                babies being washed down the street.</p>

                <p>It is only right that the clock should be reset. It ill
                becomes you, Mr&nbsp;Initial Presiding&nbsp;Officer, to listen
                to what a spokesman for IRA/Sinn Féin has to say. Members could
                all have risen with points of order. He said that I tried to
                stop Mr&nbsp;Mallon from speaking. I never tried anything of the
                sort. I pointed out — and Hansard can be checked — that a
                personal statement, which he claimed he was making, had to be
                personal and could not go into other matters. Members are being
                told by the leader of IRA/Sinn Féin that we tried to stop
                Mr&nbsp;Mallon. That is untrue. I and my Colleagues could
                continue to raise points of order. The hon Member who was
                speaking has every right to lay down the law. The people that we
                represent have been murdered, maimed, killed, slaughtered by
                these men — and now they want into the Government of the

                vote in the Assembly about whether Mr&nbsp;Mallon would be
                permitted to continue to speak. I took it that that was the

                <p>It will not be lost on Members, or on the people watching in
                the Galleries, that it was a bomber from the Loyalist
                paramilitaries who rose to protect those in the Republican
                movement who have been responsible for murdering and bombing
                this community. What is being presented to Members — and it
                will be a fait accompli undoubtedly — is the welcoming into
                the Executive Government of Northern&nbsp;Ireland of those
                involved in armed struggle, in spite of Mr&nbsp;Adams’s
                attempt to distance himself.</p>
                <p>If I am quoting correctly from the book ‘Lost Lives’ —
                written by a very reliable journalist — Mr&nbsp;Adams was the
                brigadier in charge of the Belfast brigade of the IRA on
                &quot;bloody&nbsp;Friday&quot;, the day of the
                Oxford&nbsp;Street bus station bombing. Mr&nbsp;Adams would had
                to have given his agreement to those atrocities.</p>
                <p>I make no apologies for these statements. The people of
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland know the roles that Mr&nbsp;Gerry Adams
                and Mr&nbsp;Martin&nbsp;McGuinness — who is going to be placed
                in government — have played in trying to destroy the community
                that we live in.</p>
                <p>The admission of the IRA into government is being done
                without the surrender of a single weapon; without the
                renunciation of the use of violence; and with no admission that
                the murderous work of the IRA is anything other than justified.
                Mr&nbsp;Adams, in a speech at Belfast city hall, made it clear
                that nothing he would ever say should be taken as criticism of
                the IRA volunteers. Mr&nbsp;Adams will have opportunity to
                criticise me if that statement is incorrect.</p>
                <p>Mr Trimble has no doubts about whom he is handing power over
                to and whom he is bringing into the Executive. Recently, he told
                a ‘Good Morning Ulster’ interviewer that, with one or two
                exceptions, all the Sinn&nbsp;Féin Assembly team were members
                of the IRA. I am sorry that Mr&nbsp;Trimble is not present to
                point out the two non-subscribing members of the IRA. I believe
                that Mr&nbsp;Mitchel&nbsp;McLaughlin is referred to as &quot;the
                draft dodger&quot; in IRA circles, as he has not been involved
                in active service. I do not know Ms&nbsp;de&nbsp;Brún’s

                <p>I am generous to a fault on these matters. Mr&nbsp;Mallon may
                not thank me for drawing attention to the matter, but it is my
                duty to point out that you are some way off the subject of the

                <p>I wish to make it clear that these matters flow from the fact
                that Mr&nbsp;Mallon is being reinstated as the Deputy First
                Minister (Designate), so my comments are very relevant. The
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland Unionist Party will not be giving any
                credibility to the structures that will be put in place today,
                and we will not be giving any assistance to those who wish to
                operate this undemocratic process. The Northern&nbsp;Ireland
                Unionist Party has another agenda — to demolish this affront
                to decency and justice. What are our chances of success as a
                small party opposed to the Belfast Agreement? It is similar to
                the chance that David had against Goliath. David was told that
                he had no chance. I have heard the chorus from across the Floor,
                from the Gallery, from the captains of industry and from church
                leaders. They are all saying that there is no alternative. With
                God’s help there is an alternative, and we will see off this
                affront to the democratic process.</p>

                your offices, talk of it in your workplaces, talk of it at your

                <p>Outside this Chamber — and the members of the Ulster
                Unionist Party know this well — there is a memorial stone to
                Mr&nbsp;Edgar&nbsp;Graham, a former Unionist Assembly Member
                murdered in 1983 by Mr&nbsp;Adams’s, Mr&nbsp;McGuinness’s
                and Ms&nbsp;de&nbsp;Brún’s colleagues in the IRA. The epitaph
                on the stone says &quot;Keep alive the light of justice&quot;.
                Now these people are going to be placed in government over the
                community that they have terrorised for the last 30&nbsp;years.
                Is this in the cause of justice? Is it right to seat in the new
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland Government those who have terrorised
                people for 30&nbsp;years? We should see them brought to justice

                </b>
                <p>I would like to add my comments and reflect on Mr&nbsp;Seamus&nbsp;Mallon’s
                personal statement of 15&nbsp;July. At that time I said that it
                was a very depressing day for us, but I recall that
                Rev&nbsp;Ian&nbsp;Paisley said that it was a good day for the
                DUP — that democracy had triumphed. On that day, as a result
                of those views, I felt that we had to move mountains. In the
                Mitchell review some of those mountains have been moved, but it
                is clear from today’s discussion so far that there are many
                more to move. I have compared this to queuing up to get into a
                concert — to waiting and waiting and waiting. The poor people
                in Northern&nbsp;Ireland have been the watchers and the waiters,
                and it is now time for us to give them some action. While you
                are waiting in this queue you may have the feeling that when you
                do get in, the concert will be a good one, but, from what I have
                heard today, the mood music has not changed at all.</p>
                <p>If Peter&nbsp;Robinson, the Member for East Belfast, feels
                that he can cast aspersions on people’s politics, then he must
                be able to see inside their minds. We have long said that the
                Women’s Coalition is made up of Nationalists and Unionists.
                What is wrong in Northern Ireland is that people stand on the
                self-righteousness of the purity of their pedigree. I would like
                to tell you, Mr&nbsp;Robinson, that I have been a unionist — a
                trade unionist — all my life.</p>

                are talking not about a European unionist or a trade unionist
                but about a Unionist who wants to maintain the link with the
                rest of the United Kingdom.</p>
                <b>
                <p>The Initial Presiding Officer:</p>
                </b>
                <p>It is clear from the Act and from the agreement that what is
                meant is a Unionist in the Northern&nbsp;Ireland political sense
                and not a trade unionist or other.</p>
                <p>May I also remind Members — and a number have transgressed
                slightly in this regard — that responses should be made
                through the Chair, not directly to each other. I am not sure
                that I should advise you to do this; it can be painful enough,
                but Members should make their responses through the Chair.</p>

                </b>
                <p>Again I have to say that that was not a point of order.
                Mr&nbsp;Robinson was predicting how we would have designated
                ourselves, and he could not have known.</p>

                <p>On a further point of order, Mr Initial Presiding Officer. If
                it was not a proper point of order, why did you rule on it and
                affirm that my Colleague was right? Ms&nbsp;McWilliams cannot
                question the integrity of the Chair, and as a good trade
                unionist she should know that. A Member cannot question the
                integrity of the Chair. You made a ruling, and you could not
                have made a ruling if it had not been a proper point of order.
                The trouble with the hon Member is that you ruled in favour of
                my Colleague.</p>
                <b>
                <p>The Initial Presiding Officer:</p>
                </b>
                <p>I confirm that I gave the ruling, because I judged that it
                was a proper point of order, responding to a proper issue.</p>
                <b>
                <p>Ms McWilliams:</p>
                </b>
                <p>This discussion reminds me of the DUP’s conference on
                Saturday. First they undermine you; then they ridicule you; then
                they fight you; and then — may I say to the Ulster Unionists
                — you win.</p>
                <p>This is the type of politics that we are trying to move away
                from: the politics expressed by Mr&nbsp;Cedric&nbsp;Wilson, in
                which God is entirely on his side — the politics of
                self-righteousness. I hope that in this period of change we are
                beginning to move out of the politics of blood and loyalty
                towards a new kind of politics. The Deputy First Minister
                (Designate) — I hope that the Member will be holding that
                office — will remind us once again that he addressed this in
                his speech, when he spoke of the politics of civic principles,
                tolerance and mutual respect.</p>
                <p>I was delighted to see in the Ulster Unionist Party’s
                recent statement a new kind of politics, based on equal
                opportunity and — perhaps before the end of the day — on
                open and accountable government. It is depressing that those who
                are so good at naming and blaming have done so little to shape
                this new kind of government.</p>
                <p>In his personal statement of 15&nbsp;July Mr Mallon referred
                to the willingness of the then Secretary of State, Dr&nbsp;Mowlam,
                to think the unthinkable and to go an extra mile, every time, to
                see the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. It is good
                that, today, we have an opportunity to reflect on that personal
                statement and, indeed, on the hard work of the last Secretary of
                State. I hope that we can move on from the politics of jostling
                and jeering and get down to the work that the people have
                expected from us for so long. It is good for us to be able to
                support this motion, which will ensure that Mr&nbsp;Seamus&nbsp;Mallon
                will hold office as Deputy First Minister (Designate).</p>
                <b>
                <p>Mr McCartney:</p>
                </b>
                <p>When Mr&nbsp;Seamus&nbsp;Mallon resigned, with immediate
                effect, in this Assembly I stated that in personal terms I
                regretted his resignation. He was good enough to acknowledge
                this in very courteous and kind terms in a letter. However, I do
                not think that any reasonable, sensible person could possibly
                believe that Seamus did not resign. His resignation was in the
                records of the House, its acceptance was recorded in the
                Westminster Hansard, and all the privileges and profits of his
                office were withdrawn. I do not for a moment believe that
                Mr&nbsp;Seamus&nbsp;Mallon would have accepted a single penny in
                regard to that office once he had publicly offered his
                resignation and had it accepted.</p>
                <p>If the legal opinion which the Initial Presiding Officer has
                received about whether a resignation in those terms amounts only
                to an offer of resignation represents the legal position, then,
                as Charles&nbsp;Dickens said,</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p>&quot;the law is an ass&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p>No rational human acquainted with such facts could have come
                to any other conclusion than that he had resigned — and
                resigned finally. The truth is that if Seamus had submitted
                himself for re-election in accordance with the original Standing
                Orders he would have been re-elected. I have no doubt of that.
                But the First Minister (Designate) would almost certainly not
                have been re-elected.</p>
                <p>So we go through the farce of the Secretary of State’s
                making a new Standing Order minutes before we come here so that
                what is an established fact, which any simpleton would
                understand without the need to take the opinion of Queen’s
                Counsel, is not a fact. If that is the basis upon which we are
                to proceed in the House, it is a very sandy foundation indeed.
                But it is typical of the violations of all the principles of
                democracy and personal honesty, truthfulness and integrity that
                have beset this process from the beginning, and I do not direct
                this remark towards Seamus&nbsp;Mallon personally. There is only
                one rule, and that is that the process must continue.</p>
                <p>The greatest derelictions from honesty, truth and decency, if
                uncovered, do not bring any odium upon the person who committed
                them, because he has a catch-all defence — &quot;I did it for
                peace.&quot; You can get away with murder, you can get away with
                mutilation, intimidation and bending the rules, and you can get
                away with having the political representatives of terrorists,
                who remain armed, in executive government, as long as you are
                doing it for peace.</p>
                <p>I read the debate of 15&nbsp;December&nbsp;1998 in this
                House. The motion was that those who were inextricably linked
                with an armed terrorist organisation could not possibly give an
                unqualified commitment to exclusively peaceful means and,
                therefore, could not participate in executive government.</p>
                <p>I heard Mr&nbsp;Taylor, the right hon Member for Strangford,
                say that there could be no question of executive government
                unless there was decommissioning. I heard
                Mr&nbsp;Sam&nbsp;Foster talking about arms, men and equipment in
                the undergrowth outside and saying that to talk about an
                executive government including these people, without actual
                decommissioning, was ludicrous. I heard others, including Maj&nbsp;McFarland,
                saying that they had been deluded and deceived by Mr&nbsp;Blair.
                Mr&nbsp;McFarland believed his promise that no prisoners would
                be given early release until there was decommissioning, and
                said, in a plaintive tone, in the last sentence of his address,
                that but for those pledges they would not have signed up to the
                agreement. Mr Armstrong said that no reasonable person could
                conceivably let the representatives of terrorists, and those
                with whom they are inextricably linked, into government without
                decommissioning.</p>
                <p>Where are all these worthies now? Where are all these people
                who have violated what they said publicly, on indelible record
                in Hansard? These people, who know that they are currently
                unelectable, are agreeing and using subterfuges such as the
                present one to maintain their position and have violated all the
                principles of democracy. They have violated all the principles
                of truth, public decency and honour. They have sown the wind,
                and surely they will reap the whirlwind of electoral
                destruction, for that is where they are headed.</p>
                <p>I was not present when the First Minister (Designate)
                referred to the legal arguments which I had put forward. I do
                not claim that those legal arguments are unanswerable.</p>
                <p>In the House I expounded those arguments, for good or ill.
                Did we hear the First Minister (Designate) rejecting any of them
                or making any analysis of the principles of law or democracy
                that would have confounded them? We heard only the usual snide,
                throwaway line that has become the hallmark of his addresses.</p>
                <p>This is a sad day for democracy. The Assembly and the
                devolved Government, which I opposed, have not been set up on an
                honourable and straightforward basis. If the Administration had
                been mounted on the truth and on the promises which the parties
                concerned had made to the electorate, I should have said that I
                disagreed with it and that it might cause difficulties. But I
                should also have said that as it is the product of a democratic
                process, I must accept it. However, I cannot accept a devolved
                Government that is elected as a result of political chicanery,
                put in place by the devious means we have seen today and
                constructed at the diktat of the Secretary of State to provide
                cover for the unelectable. If the original rules were observed,
                Mr&nbsp;Trimble would be unelectable today as First Minister. He
                knows it, the public know it, and so do the electorate. If that
                is a sound basis for the future democratic welfare of the
                Assembly, I fear for it.</p>
                <p>Peace is a worthy objective, but peace obtained by the
                sacrifice of the principles of democracy and of personal
                integrity, and at the price of forsaking the promises that
                parties make to the electorate is surely doomed to disaster. The
                motion should not be accepted.</p>

                <p>When I laid out the terms for the debate I said that it would
                extend to two hours so that all parties wishing to speak could
                do so, and that amount of time would have allowed each party its
                full time to speak. After about one hour all the parties who
                wished speak have done so. Some parties have extensive lists of
                Members wishing to contribute, and I am minded to allow those
                parties, of which there are about three, to have another bite of
                the cherry. We shall then proceed to the winding-up speeches and
                the vote.</p>
                <b>
                <p>Mr S Wilson:</p>
                </b>
                <p>Today’s proceedings have been described as verging on
                farce. In the light of the background to today’s debate and
                the point that we have reached in the proceedings, it has to be
                said that there is some justification in that description. In
                our pigeon-holes this morning we found a set of rules which were
                devised and printed on 26&nbsp;November. By lunchtime those
                rules had been revised, purely for the purpose of getting us to
                our present stage and, of course, beyond that to the point which
                the First Minister (Designate) has told us that he cannot wait
                to reach. Indeed, he waived many of his speaking rights to get
                to that point.</p>
                <p>We are at this stage because the Ulster Unionist Party has
                been prepared to tear up its manifesto. Had it not been prepared
                to do that, we would not have reached this point. The Secretary
                of State has turned a blind eye to arms smuggling, shootings and
                beatings to get us to this stage. As I have said, the debate and
                the background to it are farcical.</p>
                <p>Of course, in this farce, we are operating under rules which
                are as bent as — I suppose you know how I was going to finish
                that one off, Mr&nbsp;Initial Presiding Officer, so before you
                rule that I am being unparliamentary, I will not say any more.
                That is where we have got to.</p>
                <p>Those looking at this objectively from the outside would see
                that what is going on here is not normal parliamentary
                democracy. The casual observer would see that we have bent and
                torn up the rules and that we are now debating whether Mr&nbsp;Mallon
                resigned. Does he believe he resigned, or have we imagined it?
                Ms&nbsp;McWilliams mentioned that this is like a concert. It is
                more like a pantomime — the Christmas pantomime season has
                started early. When I looked at the motion, its subject and the
                author, the words &quot;Snow White&quot; and &quot;dwarf&quot;
                came to mind. I think I had better clarify what I mean by that.</p>

                hair and to the political standing with the electorate of
                Mr&nbsp;Neeson’s party: 2% — the political dwarfs.</p>
                <p>The debate has been like a pantomime. Has he resigned? Yes he
                has; no he has not. Speaking as a member of the &quot;Yes&quot;
                camp — this is role reversal now — I am going to steal a
                line from someone else. I must say to those who are in the
                &quot;No&quot; camp that they cannot keep saying &quot;No&quot;,
                especially when all the evidence is against them. We have seen
                it in Hansard, and we have talked about it in the House. We have
                heard what Mr&nbsp;Mallon has said. He talked about his offer of
                resignation having immediate effect, and the Secretary of State
                stood up in the House of Commons and announced it. She said that
                it was a setback. If this was not a resignation, if it was only
                an offer, why would it be a setback? According to the Secretary
                of State, it was a sad day.</p>
                <p>My Colleague Mr&nbsp;Robinson spoke about the removal of the
                trappings of office, and I noted Mr&nbsp;Mallon’s comments. He
                has not acted in his capacity as Deputy First Minister
                (Designate) since that resignation took effect. What some
                Members are saying today seems to be totally at odds with what
                they were saying on 15&nbsp;July&nbsp;1999 when it was like a
                wake here. We had weeping, wailing and lamenting.</p>
                <p>Mr&nbsp;Neeson paid tribute to the Deputy First Minister
                (Designate). He said that that was a very sad day for the
                Assembly. This was, supposedly, just an offer of resignation. If
                it was not a real resignation, why was it a sad day? Why did he
                pay tribute to the former Deputy First Minister (Designate) if
                this was only an offer? No wonder his face was red when the
                motion was read out; he knows in his heart that there was a real
                resignation.</p>

                <p>Mr Ervine spoke on the day of Mr&nbsp;Mallon’s resignation,
                and he was at his sanctimonious best. Did he talk about how
                disappointed, frightened and worried he was about the
                consequences of the offer of resignation? No. He talked about
                the consequences of the resignation, and he went on to describe
                the death of the political process.</p>

                </b>
                <p>No. You have been doing all the giving away in the last month
                or two. Mr&nbsp;Ervine obviously believed that Mr Mallon had
                resigned. Ms&nbsp;McWilliams talked about her position on this
                and was happy to accept an offer of resignation. She talked
                about how wonderful Mr&nbsp;Mallon had been in his efforts to
                pursue the peace process. She said</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p>&quot;He&nbsp;never stopped, and I hope that, despite his
                resignation ...&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p>I could go through what others said. The Ulster Unionist
                Party, of course, were not here; they decided to run away
                because they were not ready to move to the despicable position
                that they are at today. Mr&nbsp;Mallon’s words — what he
                said about his personal standing — were heard in the Assembly,
                were reported in the House of Commons by the Secretary of State
                and were made known to the public. The headline in the ‘Belfast
                Telegraph’ said &quot;Mallon resigns&quot;; the ‘News&nbsp;Letter’
                used the same terminology. Of course, we cannot believe
                everything we read in the ‘News&nbsp;Letter’, but on this
                occasion it confirmed what everyone else was saying. So there
                was an element of truth in it.</p>
                <p>Today’s motion, as has been outlined very well by my
                Colleague Peter&nbsp;Robinson and by Mr&nbsp;McCartney, seeks to
                pretend that there was only an offer of resignation, for the
                simple reason that otherwise the rules would not allow us to go
                through the majority voting procedure that will occur at the end
                of this debate.</p>
                <p>All of this twisting and turning is to place in the
                Government of Northern&nbsp;Ireland people who, for the last
                30&nbsp;years, have killed, maimed and bombed. Many people will
                find it incomprehensible that the leader of the Ulster Unionist
                Party said that he wished to hurry along, to get to the main
                part of the business — to place those people in government.
                That is despicable. It makes this a farce and is something the
                people in Northern&nbsp;Ireland will not forgive, especially
                those who have been victims.</p>

                <b>
                <p>Mr Close:</p>
                </b>
                <p>When people outside watch this Assembly and listen to what
                has been going on, I wonder what they will think. Up to the
                moment we have had the spectacle of those who perhaps do not
                understand the meaning of the word &quot;democracy&quot;; and
                they certainly do not want to put it into practice. Their wish
                is for the voice of the people to be thwarted or overturned. If
                more than 71% of the people had voted &quot;No&quot; to the
                agreement the Members on the Benches to my left would be
                perfectly happy and content. Sadly that was not the fact. They
                were defeated — not for the first time, and certainly not for
                the last.</p>
                <p>I hear them quote strange figures, but I understand that the
                figure was 71·2%. We are speaking about the will of the people.
                Let us learn how to accept the will of the people — <i>[Interruption]</i>
                If the echoes were to die down I might be able to get on to the
                real substance of the motion.</p>
                <p>This motion is very clear. It restates the obvious: that the
                Assembly wishes Seamus&nbsp;Mallon to hold office as Deputy
                First Minister (Designate). This is not some fairy-tale wish; it
                is a wish based on hard statistical facts. Mr&nbsp;Mallon was
                elected Deputy First Minister (Designate) on
                1&nbsp;July&nbsp;1998, and the voting on that day was
                61&nbsp;votes for and 27&nbsp;votes against — 69·3% for and
                30·7% against. That is over two to one in favour. That was the
                will of the House, and, from that day until
                15&nbsp;July&nbsp;1999, Seamus&nbsp;Mallon carried out his
                duties in an admirable fashion — a fact that was recognised by
                the vast majority of Members.</p>
                <p>Then, on 15&nbsp;July&nbsp;1999, in order, as he saw it, to</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p>&quot;ensure that a meaningful review of aspects of the
                agreement will be carried out&quot;,</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p>Mr Mallon offered his resignation. Some people might want to
                wish it otherwise, but the fact remains that he offered his
                resignation.</p>
                <p>Mr Mallon has emphasised the point that the offer to resign
                was made to the Assembly. It was, after all, as has already been
                pointed out, the Assembly that elected him. I believe that it is
                a fact of law, though I am prepared to concede to those better
                qualified in the legal profession, that an offer is made for
                acceptance or rejection. I do not see it said in Hansard that
                the Assembly refused to accept that offer. It was pointed out,
                in response to a question from Mr&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;Robinson, that
                there were no procedures, no Standing Orders and no
                opportunities for the House to discuss or debate that offer. The
                record demonstrates very clearly that there was much regret and
                sadness, and this is evidence that it is the will and the desire
                of the House that Mr&nbsp;Mallon continue as Deputy First
                Minister (Designate). Even some of those who are absent from the
                Chamber now, who were opposed to his election, expressed their
                sadness at his offer to resign.</p>
                <p>I take this opportunity to assert my right as a Member of the
                Assembly to reject Mr&nbsp;Mallon’s offer to resign. I believe
                that, as an Assembly, we can collectively confirm our desire,
                first voted upon and agreed in July&nbsp;1998, that Mr&nbsp;Mallon
                hold office as Deputy First Minister (Designate) of the House.
                In so doing we can and will move forward and make progress and
                thus meet the demand of the greater majority of the people who
                want to see us making progress.</p>
                <p>When we make that progress later this evening we will see
                pseudo-reluctant Ministers, with tears in their eyes, coming
                forward and grabbing with both hands the portfolios offered and
                the trappings of office. Then, with their usual dignity and,
                some might say, hypocrisy, they will ride off and claim that
                they are doing this for the salvation of Ulster. It reminds me
                of the old cliché</p>

                <p>Mr Boyd:</p>
                </font></b><font SIZE="3">
                <p>I make no apology for opposing the motion to reinstate Seamus&nbsp;Mallon
                as Deputy First Minister (Designate). Mr&nbsp;Mallon refuses to
                recognise Northern&nbsp;Ireland’s status as an integral part
                of the United Kingdom and consistently insults our people by
                referring to Northern&nbsp;Ireland as &quot;the North of
                Ireland&quot;. I refuse to accept a Deputy First Minister
                (Designate) who wants the destruction of Northern Ireland, wants
                it subsumed into an all-Ireland republic. Mr&nbsp;Mallon and the
                SDLP have consistently opposed any devolved Government which
                will maintain Northern&nbsp;Ireland’s position as an integral
                part of the United Kingdom and which excludes terrorists.</p>
                <p>During 30&nbsp;years of terror the SDLP consistently
                condemned violence while not hesitating to profit politically
                from it. The SDLP tells us that we should forget the past. Will
                John&nbsp;Hume and his party now state publicly that
                &quot;bloody Sunday&quot; is a thing of the past and best left
                there? The SDLP now faces a clear choice between support for
                democracy and the rule of law and support for Sinn Féin/IRA in
                its demand to participate in the Executive, while retaining its
                arsenal and its terrorist structures. If the SDLP supports Sinn
                Féin/IRA in its refusal to decommission, this will render it
                indistinguishable from Sinn Féin/IRA. The alternative is for
                the SDLP to align itself with the democratic demand that Sinn
                Féin/IRA must decommission its terrorist arsenal and dismantle
                its terrorist structures. Pan- Nationalism, for which Seamus&nbsp;Mallon
                is a key strategist, has never flinched from its agenda of
                power-sharing with an Irish dimension, leading to Irish unity.
                Placing Seamus&nbsp;Mallon in the position of Deputy First
                Minister (Designate) is part of the pan-Nationalist agenda.</p>
                <p>Sinn Féin/IRA, a key part of the pan-Nationalist front, are
                not democrats. They have arrived where they are today not by
                legitimate means but through murder and intimidation. The threat
                of more bombs in the business centre of London has forced the
                British Government to capitulate. The Republican definition of
                democracy is to explode a bomb underneath a car or gun down
                opposing politicians. The clear message today is that victims
                still suffer. There must be no terrorists in government. The
                victims’ agony is compounded by allowing unrepentant armed
                killers and their apologists into our Government.</p>
                <p>A policy of appeasement of Fascists was tried in the 1930s,
                and it failed. This Government has also turned a blind eye.
                Today Tony&nbsp;Blair, in a style reminiscent of Chamberlain,
                preaches &quot;peace for our time&quot;. If only we could turn a
                blind eye to the ongoing murders and beatings. Just like Germany
                in the pre-war period, the IRA continues to build up its
                arsenal. They have peace on their lips but war in their hearts.</p>
                <p>The Belfast Agreement has delivered nothing for Unionists.
                Our Loyal Order parades are banned and our culture attacked. The
                terrorists continue to be released. The sniper team which
                murdered seven British soldiers and two RUC officers will serve
                only 13&nbsp;months. The killer of retired RUC Reservist
                Cyril&nbsp;Stewart, who was gunned down in front of his wife
                while out shopping, will serve only nine months. This is not
                peace, justice and democracy; this is appeasement. We face the
                destruction of the RUC and the prospect of terrorists in control
                of policing. Eighty per cent of IRA murders are unsolved, and we
                have continual human rights abuses by Sinn Féin/IRA. Since
                10&nbsp;April&nbsp;1998 there have been five IRA murders,
                62&nbsp;shootings, 160&nbsp;beatings and 464&nbsp;exilings —
                all carried out by paramilitaries associated with pro-agreement
                parties. The statistics relating to Loyalist terrorists are
                similar. Martin McGuinness is on record as having said on
                23&nbsp;June&nbsp;1986</p>

                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p>This is clear evidence that Martin McGuinness is a member of
                the Provisional IRA. Yet he is to take a place in the Government
                of Northern&nbsp;Ireland. Republicans have murdered over
                2,000&nbsp;people — both Protestant and Catholic — and
                Loyalists have murdered over 1,000. Yet these organisations are
                still fully intact and retain their illegal guns and explosives.</p>
                <p>The back-stepping by pro-agreement parties and the naive
                acceptance by some Ulster Unionists of a meaningless form of
                words on decommissioning will do nothing to ease the concerns of
                the long-suffering people of Northern&nbsp;Ireland. In all this
                charade the real victims of terror have been forgotten.</p>
                <p>The reality is that there are enough illegal arms and
                explosives to kill every person in Northern&nbsp;Ireland.
                Republican terrorists are estimated to have 2,658&nbsp;kg of
                Semtex, 1,200&nbsp;detonators, 1,000&nbsp;rifles,
                40&nbsp;sub-machine guns and 30&nbsp;machine guns. After
                600&nbsp;days not one ounce of Semtex has been handed in.
                Republican terrorists are also estimated to have
                600&nbsp;handguns and 1·5&nbsp;million rounds of ammunition as
                well as ground-to-air missiles, RPG&nbsp;7 launchers and two
                Barrett Light Fifty rifles. Loyalist terrorist arsenals include
                100&nbsp;rifles, 80&nbsp;sub-machine guns, and
                700&nbsp;handguns. Yet as democrats, we have to listen to people
                saying that we are not in favour of peace, justice and
                democracy.</p>
                <p>A phoney commitment by the IRA to decommissioning is an
                insult to the people of Northern&nbsp;Ireland — particularly
                to the forgotten victims. The Union is in crisis, and a split
                within the Ulster Unionist party is inevitable if
                David&nbsp;Trimble pursues his reckless policy of attempting to
                place the representatives of terrorism in government. It is time
                for anti-agreement Unionists within the Ulster Unionist Party to
                realign with other like-minded Unionists to prevent
                Sinn&nbsp;Féin/IRA from being placed in the Executive.</p>
                <p>We should all be reminded of the dastardly deeds of the
                Provisional IRA. On 19&nbsp;April&nbsp;1972 Corporal
                &quot;A&quot;— I shall refer to him in that way for the sake
                of his family — who was a UDR member, was abducted whilst
                driving a lorry along the Armagh and Republic of Ireland border.
                His badly tortured body, which was booby-trapped, was found at
                Altnamachin near Newtownhamilton. He suffered a terrible death
                at the hands of his IRA captors following his abduction and
                imprisonment at an IRA safe house in County&nbsp;Monaghan.</p>

                <p>Mr Boyd:</p>
                </b>
                <p>Corporal&nbsp;&quot;A&quot; suffered a terrible death at the
                hands of his IRA captors following his abduction and
                imprisonment at an IRA safe house in County&nbsp;Monaghan. It is
                alleged that he was nailed to the floor during his ordeal.
                Following his torture, which included burns, shocks, drowning
                and a variety of horrific abuses, he was finally shot. His
                genitals were placed in his mouth, and his stomach was removed
                and replaced with a booby-trap bomb. This was carried out by an
                organisation which our Prime&nbsp;Minister says is inextricably
                linked to Sinn&nbsp;Féin. They are one and the same.</p>
                <p>On 25&nbsp;May&nbsp;1986 the Garda informed the RUC of the
                location of the body of Mr&nbsp;&quot;D&quot;, an IRA informer.
                He was found with his hands tied behind his back, tape covering
                his eyes and a bullet wound to his head. At the request of
                Martin&nbsp;McGuinness — who in a few hours’ time will be a
                Minister in this Government — the mother of this victim helped
                to persuade her son to come home to Londonderry following an
                assurance from the Sinn&nbsp;Féin leader that he would be safe.
                When he had been home for two weeks, he was taken away by the
                IRA to County&nbsp;Donegal, never to return. Severe mental and
                physical torture was used on this victim.</p>
                <p>These evil people would have the world believe that they are
                fighting the just war of an oppressed people, but all the
                emerging evidence is that they are carrying out a psychopathic
                serial killing campaign against those with whom they disagree
                politically and, indeed, against any who would dare to stand in
                the way of their achieving their true objective — a united
                Ireland governed by fear and violence.</p>
                <p>As a democrat, I make reasonable and legitimate demands on
                behalf of the victims and all those who believe in democracy and
                the rule of law. We demand a declaration from the IRA that the
                war is over; the handover of the terrorists’ arsenals; the
                ballistic testing of the terrorists’ weaponry; the verified
                destruction of the terrorists’ arsenals; the disbandment of
                the terrorist organisations; the setting-up by Her Majesty’s
                Government of a public inquiry into human-rights abuses by the
                terrorists; and an international tribunal to investigate the
                role of the Government of the Irish Republic in the
                establishment, funding, training and arming of Sinn Féin/IRA.
                The victims still suffer, and the clear message is that there
                must be no terrorists in government —</p>

                <p>The Initial Presiding Officer:</p>
                </b>
                <p>There may be some misunderstanding with reference to some
                comments made earlier. I have been trying to understand what
                link there is between this and the motion. I have to assume that
                there is the thought that if Mr&nbsp;Mallon does not find
                himself in the position of Deputy First Minister (Designate),
                that will obstruct the running of the d’Hondt mechanism and
                the appointments to which the Member refers.</p>
                <p>In case there is any uncertainty on that issue, let me be
                clear on the point that whatever happens in respect of this
                motion, the running of the d’Hondt mechanism will take place.
                I assume that that is the connection between what the Member has
                said and this motion, and I draw this matter to the Member’s
                attention lest he should spend the remainder of his time
                addressing a question which is not in order.</p>
                <b>
                <p>Rev Dr Ian Paisley:</p>
                </b>
                <p>While what you have said is true, it is also true to say that
                if the 10&nbsp;members of the Executive are appointed today the
                Executive cannot take over devolved government unless it is
                ordered so to do by the First Minister (Designate) and the
                Deputy First Minister (Designate). If we do not have a First
                Minister (Designate) and a Deputy First Minister (Designate)
                what we do today cannot come into operation. Therefore the hon&nbsp;Gentleman
                has every right to argue that if the IRA has to get into
                government in this way he is opposed to it.</p>
                <b>
                <p>The Initial Presiding Officer:</p>
                </b>
                <p>He does. However, to carry forward the procedure you are
                describing, it would be entirely possible for the d’Hondt
                mechanism to be applied, for 10&nbsp;Ministers to be put into
                place, and for there then to be an election of the First
                Minister (Designate) and the Deputy First Minister (Designate).
                I am making this point in case the Member feels that his speech
                is directed towards the motion, when it seems to me that this is
                not entirely the case. The Member may continue.</p>

                <p>But it is in the right direction because if Mr&nbsp;Mallon
                does not succeed in getting back the position of Deputy First
                Minister (Designate) the Executive can never be called together.</p>

                </b>
                <p>I would like to return to the issue of Members on the
                opposite side of the Chamber naming individuals in this Chamber
                today. The Initial Presiding Officer rebuked
                Mr&nbsp;Paisley&nbsp;Jnr on the matter of the integrity of
                Members in this Chamber. I am concerned that, although few
                Members will take much notice of some of the comments and drivel
                that we have been hearing from some Members today, there has
                been too much latitude given to some Members with regard to
                allegations they have been making. I do not know whether the
                people against whom the allegations have been made are that
                concerned. However, the Initial Presiding Officer made a ruling
                concerning the questioning of the integrity of Members, and far
                too much latitude has been given. I want to put on record that
                people have been defamed in the Chamber this afternoon. We will
                all be carefully scrutinising Hansard tomorrow morning because
                some of the comments that have been allowed have been absolutely
                disgraceful.</p>
                <b>
                <p>The Initial Presiding Officer:</p>
                </b>
                <p>As I have said on a number of occasions, I listen as
                carefully as I can to all the things being said, as they are
                being said, and I also scrutinise Hansard afterwards. It is not
                an easy task because sometimes things are said which raise
                questions, including questions about particular parliamentary
                procedure. I try to keep my mind focused, and I do try to get
                constant legal advice. I will certainly be scrutinising Hansard
                after this — and not only because you will be doing so too.</p>
                <b>
                <p>Mr Maskey:</p>
                </b>
                <p>That is all very well. However, some Members could stray —
                and perhaps some Members do not have a lot of experience — and
                inadvertently make a comment. Some Members are reading from
                lengthy scripts which are entirely defamatory and personal
                towards members of Sinn&nbsp;Féin. These are not accidental
                comments. They are well-prepared and well-delivered scripts. It
                is painfully obvious that this is so.</p>
                <b>
                <p>Rev Dr William McCrea:</p>
                </b>
                <p>Can you confirm that if any Member feels aggrieved and you
                are not able to give him justice, he can appeal to the court and
                fight his case there?</p>
                <b>
                <p>The Initial Presiding Officer:</p>
                </b>
                <p>No, I cannot confirm that, since comments made in this
                context now have privilege, although they initially did not. It
                is important that Members do not abuse their rights. My
                attention has been drawn to the question of whether this might
                be the case. I will therefore scrutinise the matter carefully.</p>

                </b>
                <p>On a point of order, Mr Initial Presiding Officer. Have you
                heard anything new today which has not been said about these
                people outside this House? And no one has been taken to court.</p>
                <b>
                <p>Mr P Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p>On a point of order. It might be useful if you could give us
                some guidance in this matter. In the House of Commons, for
                instance, one might well believe that a Minister or other
                individual has told a lie, but one may not call that person a
                liar. If we believe that someone has been responsible for
                murder, may we not call him a murderer?</p>
                <b>
                <p>The Initial Presiding Officer:</p>
                </b>
                <p>That is something I shall have to consider, since it is
                probably unparliamentary language. What you say also has other
                implications. I shall need to study it before coming back to the
                Assembly. I think we were at the point of calling Mr&nbsp;Neeson.</p>
                <b>
                <p>Mr&nbsp;Roche:</p>
                </b>
                <p>On a point of order. We must be very careful of how we use
                language. The language associated with this so-called peace
                process is couched in the most general and vacuous terms,
                intended to lend a commendable linguistic aura to what is
                happening without ever addressing specifics. The question was
                raised, if Mr&nbsp;Mallon is confirmed as Deputy First Minister
                (Designate) and d’Hondt is triggered, of what sort of people
                will be governing Northern&nbsp;Ireland, and what these people
                represent.</p>
                <p>We should be exceptionally careful that we do not place a
                prohibition on the use of language, which would prevent the use
                of concrete descriptions which can be proven. If, for example,
                one takes the word &quot;murderer&quot;, its use is totally
                inappropriate merely as a term of abuse. When that word is used
                to describe what a person is and has done, however, it can be
                entirely appropriate.</p>

                making.</p>

                <p>At the last meeting of the Assembly specific allegations were
                made against myself and other members of my party by the SDLP. I
                hope you will also investigate those.</p>
                <p>I shall draw my remarks to a close. The victims are still
                suffering. The clear message must be that there can be no
                terrorists in government. The Belfast Agreement has failed in
                three crucial areas: there has been no decommissioning, nor will
                there be; over 300&nbsp;terrorists have been released early; and
                the Patten&nbsp;Report will almost certainly destroy the RUC.
                Today we witness the death of democracy and the surrender by
                some Unionists to Sinn&nbsp;Féin/IRA. However, as Unionists, we
                all have to face the electorate, it is to be hoped, sooner
                rather than later.</p>

                <p>This Assembly offers the people of Northern&nbsp;Ireland two
                choices today. The first is to keep them tied to the shackles of
                hatred, bitterness and continued sectarian conflict. The second
                offers the opportunity to move forward and take us out of that
                conflict, providing hope for the future for all the people of
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland. In the Northern&nbsp;Ireland Forum, I
                once said that the word &quot;yes&quot; is not part of the DUP’s
                vocabulary.</p>
                <p>I am glad to see that things are changing. They will say
                &quot;Yes&quot;, and rightly so, to the two ministerial posts.
                That underlines the hypocrisy that is emerging from the
                Democratic Unionist Party and the other &quot;no&quot; men, who
                are determined to take the people of Northern Ireland &quot;no
                where&quot;.</p>
                <p>This motion is about whether we accept the offer made by
                Mr&nbsp;Mallon to resign. At the outset I stated that my main
                reason for moving this motion was to bring about the full
                implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. We have waited
                601&nbsp;days, and I do not want us to delay any further.</p>

                <p>Mr Initial Presiding Officer, would this motion have been
                passed if the proper procedure had been applied and parallel
                consent required?</p>

                <p>As there was no petition of concern, a simple majority only
                was required, and the Clerks computed the figure. I cannot
                answer your question immediately — the numbers will have to be
                checked.</p>

                </b>
                <p>I do, and I regard this as cross-community support — the
                touchstone by which I measure the vote. I thank all Members,
                including those who spoke and/or voted against the motion. It is
                in the Assembly that our myriad problems will be solved. This
                vote allows us to move forward and start to solve those
                problems.</p>

                <p>On a point of order, Mr&nbsp;Presiding Officer. You would
                confirm that Standing Order&nbsp;24(5)(a) allows a combination
                of signatures and Members rising. You have 29&nbsp;signatures
                and are required only to find out if there are any other Members
                who would sign. Perhaps the Ulster Unionist Party did not fully
                understand this. Some of its members may want another
                opportunity to lend their support.</p>

                <p>I have some advice for Members before we proceed directly to
                running d’Hondt. Once this procedure is commenced, it will not
                be interrupted except by leave of the Assembly or under the
                terms of Standing Order&nbsp;22 whereby a nominating officer may
                make request for a 15-minute suspension in order to consult
                before making his nomination. I remind Members that, as required
                by Initial Standing Orders, I have, by reference to the party
                affiliations as indicated by Members when taking their seats,
                published a consolidated list of political parties represented
                in the Assembly, the Assembly Members belonging to each
                political party and the nominating officer for each party.</p>
                <p>At the sitting of the Assembly on 16&nbsp;February&nbsp;1999
                a joint proposal from the First Minister (Designate) and the
                Deputy First Minister (Designate) relating to the number of
                ministerial offices to be held by Northern Ireland Ministers and
                the functions exercisable by the holder of each such office
                after the appointed day was agreed with cross-community support.
                I am now required by Initial Standing Orders to conduct the
                allocation of ministerial offices (designate) in accordance with
                the procedures set out in Initial Standing Orders.</p>
                <p>Before commencing, I wish to remind Members again of the
                requirements set out in Initial Standing Orders. I shall ask the
                nominating officer from each political party, in the order
                required by the formula contained in the Initial Standing
                Orders, to select an available ministerial office (designate)
                and to nominate a person to hold it who is a member of his party
                and of the Assembly. Should a nominating officer require further
                time to consider a selection or nomination, it is open to me to
                permit a brief suspension of 15&nbsp;minutes. However, I should
                point out that if no such request is made, or if the nominating
                officer does not make the selection or the nomination required
                within a maximum period of five minutes, or if the nominee does
                not agree to take up the selected ministerial office (designate)
                within the period of five minutes, in accordance with the
                Initial Standing Orders, I will ask the next nominating officer
                in line, according to the required formula, to select and to
                nominate. Under the terms of the Initial Standing Orders, the
                First Minister (Designate) and the Deputy First Minister
                (Designate) may be nominated themselves to hold a ministerial
                office (designate).</p>
                <p>The last time we tried this procedure Members responded
                spontaneously with applause after each successful nominations. I
                suggest that today we hold back any expressions of emotion,
                positive or otherwise, and if at the end of the procedure the
                leaders of parties wish to make a brief comment, they may do so
                then. That is in order that expressions of emotion during the
                process can be restrained.</p>

                </b>
                <p>May I very briefly set the context which allows me to respond
                positively to your enquiry about my willingness to take office.
                Everyone here knows that I am one of the sternest opponents of
                the Belfast Agreement. I have consistently maintained that the
                purpose and the objective of the agreement is to have
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland absorbed into a united Ireland through
                developing all-Ireland institutions. I still believe that to be
                the process underlying it. Whether a Member or a Minister, as a
                convinced Unionist I shall use every ounce of the influence I
                possess to frustrate and thwart Northern&nbsp;Ireland’s being
                conveyed into a united Ireland.</p>
                <p>My position, in relation to both the release of paramilitary
                prisoners and the destruction of the RUC through the apparatus
                devised by the Belfast Agreement, is on public record and is
                unchanged. Moreover, it remains for me a fundamental principle
                that only those who are committed to exclusively peaceful and
                democratic means are suitable partners in government. The call
                of my conscience and the commitments I have given to the people
                of Northern&nbsp;Ireland are unalterable. I oppose terrorism in
                all its forms and of every shade. Whether it be the murder of a
                friend or that of an odious adversary, I oppose it without
                qualification and without any mental reservation.</p>
                <p>As far as my conduct as a prospective Minister may be an
                issue, I want to place firmly on the record my intention and
                disposition to be scrupulously fair in every respect, while
                exercising such responsibilities as may be in my charge. The
                religious conviction or political opinion of any person or group

                </b>
                <p>On a point of order, Mr&nbsp;Initial Presiding Officer. There
                will be a debate in the House of Commons tomorrow on what we are
                doing here today. It is right that Members of Parliament who are
                also Members of this House should have an opportunity to attend
                the Commons to defend their actions here. The programme
                suggested that we would sit through the night, but as it is
                still early the Assembly should go ahead with the other
                nominations. We have time tonight, and we should use it to deal
                at least with the question of the Chairmen and Deputy Chairmen,
                which will not take up very much time. I wish to put that on the
                record for the Whips.</p>
                <b>
                <p>The Initial Presiding Officer:</p>
                </b>
                <p>Knowing your Whip, I have no doubt that he will convey that
                very robustly at the meeting which will take place immediately
                while other Members start dinner.</p>

                </b>
                <p>It was agreed during the suspension that we would proceed
                through the motion establishing Shadow Statutory Departmental
                Committees to the appointment of Chairmen and Deputy Chairmen.</p>
                <p>Before we move to item&nbsp;6 on the Order Paper I want to
                point out two things. First, for those Committee Chairpersons
                who are appointed this evening there will be a briefing in
                Room&nbsp;21, if they so wish, at the end of this sitting.
                Others can get briefing at their leisure tomorrow or the day
                after. The Clerk of Committees will be available in Room&nbsp;21
                to give them their briefing and introduce them to their
                Committee Clerks.</p>
                <p>Secondly, this is a more complex procedure than the d’Hondt
                for Ministers because of the requirement that nominating
                officers shall not nominate someone to be a Chairman or Deputy
                Chairman of a Committee in which their party has an interest, in
                whose Department it has a Minister. This may mean that parties
                will sometimes need to avail of the opportunity for a short
                recess. We should try to be economical with time. Although
                parties have the right to ask for a recess of up to
                15&nbsp;minutes, they do not have to take 15&nbsp;minutes every
                time. I would like them to indicate whether they want
                five&nbsp;minutes, 10&nbsp;minutes or 15&nbsp;minutes, as the
                number of appointments to be made is substantial.</p>

                <p>The Initial Presiding Officer:</p>
                </font></b><font SIZE="3">
                <p>I am now required to supervise the appointment of a Chairman
                and a Deputy Chairman of each Statutory Committee. I wish to
                remind Members of the requirements set out in Initial Standing
                Orders. I shall ask the nominating officer of each political
                party, in the order required by the formula contained in Initial
                Standing Orders, to select an available Shadow Statutory
                Committee and to nominate a person who is a member of his party
                and of the Assembly to be the Chairman or Deputy Chairman of it.</p>
                <p>A nominating officer, if unable to be present, can indicate
                in writing that someone else will nominate. I have already
                received one message, and I may receive others, in regard to
                that. Also Mr&nbsp;McCartney has advised me that he will not be
                making any nominations and that he has not authorised anyone
                else to make nominations on his behalf. When we come to that
                point I will remind the House, but since he has formally advised
                me of the fact, it will not be necessary to wait for his
                nominations, which will clearly not be forthcoming. Should a
                nominating officer require further time to consider a selection
                or nomination, it is open to me to permit a brief suspension. I
                would ask that you specify five, 10 or 15&nbsp;minutes. If no
                such request is made, and the nominating officer does not make
                the selection or nomination required, or the nominee does not
                take up the selected Committee office within five minutes, I am
                required to pass on to the nominating officer next in line.</p>
                <p>There are three key matters which nominating officers must
                bear in mind. A Minister (Designate) or junior Minister
                (Designate) — that does not apply at present — may not be
                the Chairman or Deputy Chairman of a Shadow Statutory Committee.
                No Member may be nominated to serve as a Chairman or Deputy
                Chairman of a Shadow Statutory Committee if he is the Chairman
                or Deputy Chairman of another Committee. In making nominations,
                nominating officers shall prefer Committees in which they do not
                have a party interest. A nominating officer has a party interest
                in a Committee if it is established to advise a Minister
                (Designate) who is a member of his party.</p>
                <p>I call Mr Trimble, as nominating officer of the political
                party for which the formula laid down in Standing Orders gives
                the highest figure, to select a Shadow Statutory Committee and
                to nominate a person who is a member of his party and of the
                Assembly to be Chairman or Deputy Chairman of it.</p>

                </b>
                <p>I should have pointed out that it is entirely open to
                nominating officers to nominate a Chairman or a Deputy Chairman.
                It seems likely that they will choose Chairmen rather than
                Deputy Chairmen, but all are free to choose.</p>

                Standing Orders insist that one shall prefer the chairmanship or
                the deputy chairmanship where there is no party involvement at
                ministerial level.</p>
                <p>For that reason — and as far as I can ascertain, there is
                no bar to this — we are going to have parties with a Chairman
                and a Deputy Chairman of the same Committee. I appreciate that
                it is becoming more complicated for the parties to work out
                their arrangements, but the situation is different from that for
                the selection of Ministers.</p>
