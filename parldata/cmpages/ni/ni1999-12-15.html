                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font SIZE="3">With permission,
                Mr&nbsp;Speaker, I would like to make a statement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This morning we reach another important
                milestone on the road to fulfilling our new responsibilities
                under the Good Friday Agreement. I have the honour of laying
                before the Assembly the first Budget agreed by the Executive
                Committee.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The management of public spending is one of
                the fundamental responsibilities of any Government, and this is
                the first time in almost 30&nbsp;years that local politicians
                have had the privilege of accepting this responsibility. The
                Budget for the next financial year 2000-01 has been agreed by
                the Executive Committee, and in fulfilment of section&nbsp;64 of
                the Northern Ireland Act (1998) I now lay it before the
                Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Act and the Good Friday Agreement
                envisage that the Assembly and its Committees will be able to
                scrutinise the Budget proposals before voting on them at some
                future date. I want to explain the background before taking
                questions on this statement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have also taken charge of the Budget for
                the remainder of this year, 1999-2000. This will require very
                careful management by all Ministers to match spending to the
                resources available. However, today we are looking forward to
                the Budget for next year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our intentions in the agreement were that the
                spending plans should be embedded in and support the programme
                of government. As we take responsibility for the public services
                devolved to the Assembly under the agreement, it is vital that
                we develop a clear and coherent view of what we are trying to
                achieve and that that view is both realistic and visionary. That
                is right at the core of our new role, and we have a compelling
                obligation, but also a great opportunity, to set the new
                direction for the policies and services that are needed and
                wanted by our people. The programme of government will express
                the vision, and the spending plans will be one of the most
                important means of delivering that programme.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We now have to move from championing a few
                issues to deciding priorities among all the issues — from
                opposing to leading — and hence earn the respect of those who
                have entrusted us with this role. We must graduate from making
                demands to making decisions; from making demands against each
                other to making decisions with each other and for each other.
                The new politics will be not about arguing the worst in each
                other but about achieving the best for all.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Reaching agreement on the programme of
                government and the spending plans will mean addressing the hard
                choices that lie ahead. However, by virtue of the talks process,
                and from the experience that many Members have of working
                together in district councils and other bodies, I believe that
                we are well prepared for the task.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some very clear guiding principles are
                expressed in the agreement. The Budget has to command
                cross-community support, and there can be no question of any
                Minister, or the Executive Committee as a whole, pursuing
                spending plans which are manifestly unfair. Quality and equality
                are the twin ethics which must inform the development of public
                policy, the delivery of public services and the management of
                public spending.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the new structures there needs to be scope
                for each Minister and the respective departmental Committee to
                work together to produce detailed plans which will ensure that
                departmental budgets are used in the best possible way to serve
                the interests of all. Working closely with the Office of the
                First Minister and the Deputy First Minister, my Department and
                I will be examining spending plans and proposals in order to get
                the best possible value for money.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Work is only beginning on the process of
                drawing up the programme of government, and we have entered
                devolution very late in the cycle for planning a Budget for next
                year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For these reasons the Executive Committee has
                decided that the Budget plans for the year 2000-01 should roll
                forward the plans that we inherited.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is not to say that the Executive
                Committee is satisfied with the total spending power given to us
                in these plans or with the detail of how the funds are to be
                distributed. We believe that the plans can and must be improved,
                and as we improve them our having democratically elected local
                politicians taking decisions will be seen to be making a strong,
                positive and valuable difference. However, our view is that the
                changes we make should be guided by the programme of government,
                when it is ready. It would be wrong to be rushed into premature
                shifts in spending allocations, especially at this stage of the
                year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Time and circumstances do not allow us to
                demonstrate yet the difference devolution will make. To engage
                gratuitously in significant or even superficial reallocations at
                this point would be an indulgence tantamount to political
                joyriding with the associated risks of danger and damage.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The plans we have inherited give us a total
                of £8.9 billion for public services. Of that amount we have
                full discretion for about £5&nbsp;billion. The rest is needed
                for the likes of social-security benefits or for matters that
                have already been defined, such as the EU peace programme, and
                for which specific additions have been agreed by the Treasury in
                London. The total is decided by the Cabinet in London, and we
                will need to do all we can to ensure that we receive a fair and
                acceptable share of the Chancellor’s cake.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As many Members are well aware from other
                contexts, once the final allocation is known, the remaining
                responsibility is to take the best possible decisions on the use
                of whatever fixed total amount of money is available. The
                allocations to the range of services we have inherited reflect
                the decisions taken by the previous Secretary of State in
                December&nbsp;1998 following the comprehensive spending review,
                and those decisions set fixed totals for spending on that range.
                Much has happened since then, and new costs affect almost all of
                our public services. In the longer term we will need to take
                decisions on dealing with these pressures as we work to set out
                our priorities in the programme of government. In the meantime,
                the Executive Committee’s view is that it is best if each
                Department adjusts its spending plans for the first year, with
                the agreement of the Department of Finance and Personnel, to
                enable it to make the necessary provision for developments since
                December&nbsp;1998.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The plans that we have inherited make
                provision for the new costs of the Assembly, the new
                Departments, the North/South bodies, the North/South Ministerial
                Council, the Civic Forum and the Equality Commission. These
                costs are significant, and, although we are in no doubt that the
                provisions of the agreement have to be paid for, we also have a
                responsibility to operate the new structures with a proper
                concern for economy. The Department of Finance and Personnel and
                the Public Accounts Committee, which has yet to be appointed,
                will seek to promote the need to get good value for money in all
                aspects of the new arrangements.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The only revenue measure which is under our
                control is the regional rate. This is now part of the financing
                of our total spending plans. We have inherited plans that depend
                on the domestic regional rate’s being increased by 8%&nbsp;per
                year for the next two&nbsp;years. One associated factor was the
                decision by the previous Secretary of State to increase spending
                on the water and sewerage system. This is necessary to enable it
                to reach the standards that have been set by the EU. We will
                need to review the regional rate as part of our work on the
                programme of government, but for the year immediately ahead the
                Executive Committee has decided to roll forward the plans that
                we inherited. This will mean an increase in the domestic
                regional rate of 8% and in the non-domestic regional rate of
                5.3%.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The spending plans for 2000-01 do not yet
                include the expenditure which had to be deferred from 1999-2000
                as a result of the delay in the sale of Belfast harbour. If the
                sale does proceed, it will be possible to go ahead with action
                on the key projects which were held up this year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Also still ahead are the decisions on the new
                round of EU structural funds. There will need to be further
                extensive discussion on their use, and especially on the use of
                the new peace programme, which is a unique resource available to
                be used as effectively as possible in the new context we face.
                At this first formal opportunity, I would like to express our
                thanks for and appreciation of the consistent and patient
                support from the European Council of Ministers and the
                Commission, throughout the peace process and our thanks too for
                the goodwill that has also been shown by so many. We owe much to
                the former Commission, and especially to President&nbsp;Santer
                and Commissioners Wulf-Mathies and Flynn. We have already
                received indications of support from President&nbsp;Prodi and
                Commissioner&nbsp;Barnier, and we look forward to working with
                them and their colleagues to ensure that wider European
                experience can help us to grow as a region.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members will be relieved to know that I will
                not attempt now to explain all the details of the spending plans
                for each service for the year ahead. Some of the key facts are
                covered in the Budget document which has been made available to
                Members. The figures for individual services for next year are
                in some cases higher and in some cases lower than for this year.
                There are various reasons for this, such as one-off items of
                spending in 1999-2000, changes in the responsibilities of
                departments for services and reallocations determined in the
                comprehensive spending review. Also, the figures are rounded to
                the nearest million, which I admit can distort the comparisons.
                The Committees<i> </i>will be provided with more detailed
                figures to enable them to scrutinise these proposals, and I am
                sure that they will wish to look at all of the factors in
                detail.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The allocations include the costs of
                devolution, which are higher than was specifically provided for
                in the comprehensive spending review. I refer here, for example,
                to the costs of the Assembly itself and of the North/South
                bodies. We have been able to cover the additional costs by using
                funds which had not been finally committed in the comprehensive
                spending review. Thus the allocation in this Budget for each of
                the new Departments will maintain the same level of service
                provision as in the publicly announced plans inherited from the
                comprehensive spending review.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Each departmental Committee will be able to
                take evidence on the implications for services for 2000-01 in
                its Department, and Ministers will provide details as
                appropriate. Many people working in key public services are
                depending on our decisions to enable them to make more detailed
                plans — for example, for their school or hospital. Thus the
                position needs to be finalised as soon as possible. In the
                meantime, Departments will be planning on the basis of the
                figures set out in the Budget document unless and until any
                changes are agreed with the Assembly, and they will be providing
                the necessary details to their sponsored bodies on this basis.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, I encourage everybody to remember
                that these plans cover only the first year of our
                responsibilities. We should devote most of our energies in the
                next few months to developing a programme of government that can
                truly express our hopes and aspirations for our people. At the
                same time we will be participating in the next
                United&nbsp;Kingdom spending review, which will cover the years
                2001-02 to 2003-04. This will be on the new basis of resource
                budgeting, which will make sure that, in a new way, our thinking
                is focussed on the outcomes we are trying to achieve and will
                bring home more fully the true resource costs of the options for
                action. Next year’s review will be not just about disciplined
                financial management but also about conscientious policy
                setting.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I look forward to the opportunity next year
                to present a Budget that is built on that process and
                demonstrates our view of the priorities and objectives for the
                services for which we are now responsible.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am very grateful for the understanding,
                co-operation and support that have been shown by all Ministers
                during the urgent discussions that we have had on the Budget
                since devolution. I recognise the pressures that this Budget has
                entailed for them. Many Departments will be anxious to avail of
                any in-year easements or savings that may become available as
                2000-01 progresses. This underlines the importance of
                disciplined financial management, and I hope that the Assembly
                Committees will take account of the significance of this need
                for discipline as they begin to examine the spending plans. The
                Department of Finance and Personnel and I will work with and for
                all the other Departments and Ministers. We will not be
                high-handed, but we will be hard-headed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I invite the Assembly to consider these
                Budget proposals and to approve them following timely
                deliberation by the Committees.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister will be aware that there was
                some discussion yesterday about the cost of the North/South
                Ministerial Council. In the Budget statement, references are
                made to approximately £8&nbsp;million of expenditure,
                distributed among five Departments. There is also a reference to
                the sum provision of these costs in the Office of the First
                Minister and the Deputy First Minister. Can the Minister tell
                the House what he considers to be the likely first-year cost of
                these bodies? Also, can he confirm that these costs will be
                divided equally between the Northern Ireland Assembly and Dáil
                Éireann — in other words, that the amounts spent by the
                Assembly will be matched by amounts by Dáil Éireann?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, may I draw the Minister’s
                attention to his remarks about the sale of Belfast harbour. He
                said that if the sale were to proceed, it would be possible to
                go ahead with key projects which were held up this year. If this
                sale does not proceed, does he envisage some of the
                infrastructure projects, which are of considerable importance in
                a number of areas, being funded in other ways? Does he envisage
                trying to make savings elsewhere in the Budget in order to
                enable these projects to go ahead even if the sale of the port
                does not proceed?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I understood that I would take a series of
                questions and reply to them in the way that happened yesterday.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we achieve the sale of the harbour this
                year we will be able to make moves on deferred projects that it
                was intended should be undertaken. If we do not do that, we will
                not be able to move on those projects, and the Departments that
                would have been sponsoring them and the Department of Finance
                and Personnel will have to see what options remain. Those
                decisions would have to be taken not by my Department but by
                various Departments and the Executive Committee.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The cost of the North/South bodies is shared
                between ourselves and the authorities in the South, and the
                manner in which that happens varies from body to body, depending
                on the nature of the work involved. We do not pay any more than
                a fair and reasonable share of the costs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It should also be understood that these
                bodies were set up to achieve benefits, and they will achieve
                those benefits. We should not look at those bodies simply in
                terms of cost. We need to look at the benefits that will accrue
                from the programmes that will be undertaken and at the savings
                that may accrue from the workings of the bodies and from broader
                North/South co-operation in the future.</p>

                bring home more fully the true resource costs of the options for

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I recognise that it would have been difficult
                for the Minister, in the short time available, to look at the
                vexed question of student grants and loans. In future budgets,
                will he look at the possibility of making money available to the
                Department of Higher and Further Education, Training and
                Employment so that it can meet this expenditure?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister for Higher and Further
                Education, Training and Employment has indicated an interest in
                this question, as has the departmental Committee. We will wait
                and see what comes from that. I should point out, however, that
                there are financial implications. The abolition of fees would
                mean that the institutions would lose that part of the £1,025
                per student fee income that they receive from private sources.
                To compensate the institutions for that would cost us some £15
                million per year at today’s prices. In exploring our options
                we need to understand that any such expenditure would have to
                come from somewhere else, and those immediate cost implications
                are not the only ones. This matter is for the Minister and the
                departmental Committee to explore. I am simply pointing out the
                cost implications.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the broader area of resource budgeting,
                Members should not see this as some new, dry financial
                management advice from the Treasury. It is a means of making
                sure that our approach to public expenditure moves beyond a
                fixation with inputs and with comparing one year’s inputs with
                the next year’s. The traditional approach has been to
                increment the inputs year on year, without focusing on achieving
                the real outcomes we want, or even on what those outcomes are.
                The shift to resource budgeting will create convergence between
                necessary disciplined financial management and conscientious
                policymaking. Having identified the outcomes that we want, we
                will then compare budgets and performance to see that output is
                related to outcomes and that input is sufficient to achieve
                those outcomes. This will be better than the more limited and,
                in policy terms, less effective approach that we have been used
                to.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Poots:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I cannot see whether the Minister has a red
                briefcase, but I know that he has a red file, which is a good
                start.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister has set out a cost of £10
                million against the 10 new Departments. That is a little less
                than the £90&nbsp;million postulated by the Ulster Unionist
                Party’s financial whizz-kid, Jim&nbsp;Nicholson, but it is
                still a significant amount. The Minister also set aside
                £8&nbsp;million for the North/South bodies. What are the costs
                of the North/South Ministerial Council and the Civic Forum,
                which is buried somewhere in the Office of the First and Deputy
                First Ministers?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister also said that it has been
                possible to cover the additional costs by using funds that were
                not finally committed in the comprehensive spending review. This
                is a little different from the approach that he took last year
                when he said that there was an understanding at the round-table
                discussion that over the life of the Assembly the additional
                costs for the new arrangements would be recovered elsewhere.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;John&nbsp;Taylor also indicated that
                any extra expenditure should be offset by rationalising the
                remainder of public administration in Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What plans does the Minister have to reclaim
                this money from other sources — for example, by reducing the
                number of quangos? Members heard yesterday that more quangos are
                to be created. The money for these new institutions would
                normally have gone to schools or roads if it had not been used.
                How does the Minister intend to reclaim the money to fund these
                institutions?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Five hundred thousand pounds has been
                provided to meet the costs of the North/South Ministerial
                Council, and £360,000 for the Civic Forum.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I said in my statement, the costs of the
                new institutions are being carried in such a way that the Budget
                allocation for each of the new Departments will allow the same
                level of service provision as was provided for in the publicly
                announced plans of the comprehensive spending review which we
                have inherited. The costs are not being levied against any of
                the planned programmes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The wider and slightly longer-term question
                of making good those costs by achieving savings in other
                administrative areas will be addressed in the programme of
                government. These savings will not be achieved overnight, and we
                must ensure that the total administrative structure is working
                effectively. The new Departments, having a greater focus on
                their own responsibilities — and perhaps being able to brigade
                together the more compatible and less incongruous ones — will
                be able to deliver more effective and efficient programmes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many of the new Departments may also be in a
                better position to explore other options, such as the private
                finance initiative, than previously.</p>

                main. I look forward to such matters being resolved in the
                immediate future, because decisions of this nature were put on

                water connection charges. I cannot comment on the latter, as
                another Department is directly responsible for them. Naturally,
                the parent Department will wish to address the matter in
                consultation with the Department of Finance and Personnel, but
                it would be wrong for me to give an undertaking that pre-empted

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Having listened to the Minister’s
                statement, I am convinced more than ever that the Assembly
                should have tax-raising and tax-varying powers in line with
                those of the devolved Parliament in Scotland. The Minister
                mentioned the importance to his Department and to the
                yet-to-be-formed Public Accounts Committee of the Assembly’s
                getting value for money. Does he agree that, in line with the
                Westminster convention, the Chairperson of the Public Accounts
                Committee should come from a party other than the four that make
                up the Government? Prior to devolution an Ad Hoc Committee was
                established to consider the sale of the port of Belfast. Does
                the Minister agree that it would be worthwhile debating the
                report that was tabled by that Committee to enable the matter to
                be progressed as quickly as possible?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Issues to do with the sale of the port of
                Belfast are the responsibility of the Department for Regional
                Development. As I said in response to an earlier question, it is
                not for me to say what should or should not happen following
                publication of the report of the Ad Hoc Committee or any other
                measures that are being explored. Let us be clear about this: my
                Department’s interest in the sale of the port of Belfast
                relates solely to securing the £70&nbsp;million that was
                factored into the spending plans for last year. We would like to
                be able to secure that £70&nbsp;million this year. How such a
                sale is to be achieved is a matter for the Department for
                Regional Development. It will also be considered by the
                Executive Committee, so it would be wrong for me to speak out of
                turn about specific favoured options.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I fully appreciate the point that Mr&nbsp;Neeson
                made about the chairmanship of the Public Accounts Committee. I
                made a similar point during the agreement negotiations, and
                during consideration of the Northern Ireland Bill — the Bill
                that was to give legislative effect to the agreement — my
                party and I pointed out to the Northern Ireland Office that
                Westminster convention should be followed when this appointment
                was being made. Provision for that was not included in the
                legislation. Perhaps people thought that, in the circumstances,
                it would have pointed towards a particular Member’s being
                given that role. I do not know. However, I understand and
                sympathise with the Member’s point.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Tax-raising powers were not in the agreement
                that we negotiated. However, we should be careful about what we
                ask for in that regard. Would having an Assembly on the Scottish
                model, with tax-raising powers, necessarily be in our best
                interests? First, given the size of our income-tax base, would
                it yield the significant amount of money that people think it
                would? Secondly, if the Assembly had that power would the
                Treasury not treat us as though we were using it, whether we
                were or not, simply because we could?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We could find ourselves very quickly having a
                new experience with the Treasury. Many of us, from all parties,
                have often had arguments with the Treasury over additionality.
                If we got tax-raising powers, we might find ourselves dealing
                with the Treasury on a new concept of subtractionality.</p>

                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The spending plans for 2000-01 do not
                yet include the expenditure which had to be deferred from
                1999-2000 as a result of the delay in the sale of Belfast
                Harbour.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That statement made the assumption that the
                Assembly has already agreed to the sale. We have been threatened
                by the Tory Party and by Lord&nbsp;Dubs. Neither is accountable
                to the Assembly, but the Minister is. We have had 30&nbsp;years
                of people like them threatening us and telling us what we should
                do, and now we have one of our own Ministers telling us that we
                have to sell the harbour, or at least implying as much. He
                further stated</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;If the sale does proceed, it will be
                possible to go ahead with action on the key projects which were
                held up this year.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Again we are being told that if we do not
                sell the harbour we cannot proceed with the key projects. Let us
                look at where these key projects are. With the exception of the
                Westlink, they are mostly outside Belfast, yet we are talking
                about selling Belfast harbour to pay for them. Belfast harbour
                is a jewel in the Assembly’s crown, and there is not another
                Government in the world that would sell land of that sort. We
                have had the report from the Ad Hoc Committee —</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">May I encourage the Member to ask a question.
                This is not a debate.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr B Hutchinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I know that it is not a debate. I am coming
                to the question, but I want to ensure that people understand why
                I am asking it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Can the Minister tell us why he said this and
                why he is going down the same road as Lord&nbsp;Dubs and not
                allowing the Assembly to put forward other ideas for raising
                money? The £70&nbsp;million that the Labour Government said we
                were short of has, all of a sudden, appeared. These key projects
                could be done, but there should be other ways of raising the
                money, and the Assembly has not had an opportunity to explore
                them.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, I should point out to the Member that,
                as I made clear, I was presenting this Budget on behalf of the
                Executive Committee. I am not imposing the sale of Belfast
                harbour on the Assembly or on anybody else.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are dealing with a Budget that is based on
                the spending plans that we inherited, and those spending plans
                were predicated on certain key projects, including receipts from
                the sale of Belfast harbour. If we do not sell Belfast harbour,
                for whatever reason, those receipts, which were factored into
                the plan, will clearly be lost to us. The money that we would
                have raised will have to be removed from the plan or made good
                in some other way. If we accept that we are dealing with a
                permanent loss of £70&nbsp;million, we will have to cut other
                things to pay for projects that were to have been resourced from
                that sum.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Leslie asked about other funding
                sources. We shall have to look for other funding sources for
                various projects anyway.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member referred to the fact that an Ad
                Hoc Committee of the Assembly did meet to consider the subject.
                This was a cross-party Committee. It explored the issues and, in
                its report, favoured a scheme for the sale of the port. Let us
                be clear that while that report has not been adopted or endorsed
                by the Assembly, it is not a question of the Minister of Finance
                and Personnel or the Minister for Regional Development trying to
                impose this on anybody on a go-it-alone basis or of trying to
                hold anybody to ransom.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Ad Hoc Committee has looked at the issue
                and has been able to explore the various options that the Member
                seems to be touching on. It is a little disappointing to hear
                some of the arguments presented here today. It has been
                suggested that I am going down Lord&nbsp;Dubs’s road — as if
                the Department of Finance and Personnel and I were imposing on
                the Assembly things which a cross-party Committee had considered
                and explored.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Morrice:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have many questions, but I will restrict
                myself to allow others to come in.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, I must express some disappointment
                that certain areas are not covered in the Budget. I do not see
                any mention whatsoever of the victims of the past 30&nbsp;years.
                Will the Minister indicate the amount of money which will be put
                into a fund for victims this year and next year? Will he also
                say how it is to be spent?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly — and this is a vital point — we
                have seen an increase in terror on our roads. There is a huge
                public outcry for road safety because of the number of people,
                particularly children, being killed. In the Budget,
                £4&nbsp;million, which is not to be increased in the next
                financial year, has been allocated for road safety, while
                £142&nbsp;million, which is to be increased to
                £163&nbsp;million, is allocated for roads. Four million pounds
                is far too small an amount given the number of people being
                killed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Can the Minister explain why more money has
                not been provided for road safety?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member may recall that in yesterday’s
                discussions her Colleague Prof&nbsp;McWilliams asked why victims
                were listed as a responsibility of the First Minister and the
                Deputy First Minister although Adam&nbsp;Ingram, the Northern
                Ireland Office Minister, has responsibility for victims and the
                victims’ fund. The fact is that the dedicated expenditure for
                victims is a responsibility of the Northern Ireland Office, as
                Prof&nbsp;McWilliams indicated yesterday, and not of the
                Assembly.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.15 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is for the Office of the First Minister
                and the Deputy First Minister to ensure that due consideration
                is given to the needs and concerns of victims under the devolved
                arrangements and that the policies and programmes which bring
                Departments into contact with victims are sufficiently and
                properly sensitised to their needs. We do not have a dedicated
                victims’ fund. The dedicated victims’ fund is under the
                jurisdiction of the Northern Ireland Office.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member also asked about road safety and
                mentioned the amounts spent on roads and road safety. The amount
                of money which is allocated to road safety is an issue that will
                have to be considered, but in many cases money is spent on roads
                to remove accident black spots and to deal with clear road
                safety questions. A false economy could be made by favouring
                road safety above roads. Road safety, under the new
                arrangements, is a matter for the Department of the Environment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The thinking behind the creation of the new
                public safety arm within the Department of Health, Social
                Services and Public Safety was that it would take a greater
                overview of the responsibilities of all the Departments on
                safety — and that includes road safety.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr B Bell:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As someone who takes an interest in local
                government affairs I was interested in the Minister’s
                reference to the regional rate. He said</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;We will need to review the regional
                rate as part of our work on the programme of government, but for
                the year immediately ahead the Executive Committee has decided
                to roll forward the plans we inherited. This will mean increases
                of 8% in the domestic regional rate and of 5.3% in the
                non-domestic rate.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is there an implication that he intends next
                year to have a reduction in the regional rate? Or does he intend
                to use the regional rate to compensate for our lack of
                tax-raising powers?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There was no such implication. We will have
                to look at the whole rating structure, but, as the Member will
                appreciate, the area of rates is rather like quicksand once you
                get into it. We need to look at both the regional rate and the
                district rate, and, from my experience in local government, I
                realise how difficult district councillors find the interaction
                between the two. In many ways councils end up carrying the blame
                for the regional rate as well as for the district rate. Maybe
                that will change since we will have to take the blame for the
                regional rate from today. That may ease the concerns of
                councillors in that they will have somebody more obvious to
                point to.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The future of the rates will have to be
                addressed. I do not pretend that the programme for government is
                going to give the answer to that. However, it will probably
                create the context in which we explore the rating structure and
                our reliance on it for revenue. There will have to be various
                changes in rating policy, and they will include our having to
                conform with the worldwide trend of basing rates on capital
                value rather than on rental value, or whatever. A number of
                issues need to be explored, but they will all have to be dealt
                with in the round if we are going to come up with anything
                coherent. People in a neighbouring jurisdiction abolished rates
                and thought that that would be great, and others have tried to
                reform them, so we know that if we approach this on a partial or
                ad hoc basis, we will end up creating more problems than we
                solve.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is great to see a local Minister
                presenting the Budget. How does he anticipate the regional
                economy’s being reshaped to face the financial challenge ahead
                on the management of public finances? We know that the
                subvention will not grow in the future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Minister accept that the new
                programme for government over the next three to five years must
                be radical in how it tackles the task of making this region more
                self-sustaining and productive in the medium to long term?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member touched on the importance of the
                programme of government — something that I emphasised in my
                speech. So far as I am concerned, future Budgets will be
                informed and influenced by the programme of government as agreed
                by the Executive and in consultation with, and with input from,
                the Committees. A programme of government which is developed on
                that inclusive basis, on which everyone has influence and input,
                will be qualitatively different from the public-policy and
                public-service management schemes that were in place before. We
                will have to make hard choices. We will have to start getting
                used to the concept of priorities. At times, indeed, we will
                have the hard task of reducing a number of priorities to one. As
                a great socialist leader once said,</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Priorities should be the language of
                politics, and it should truly be spoken in the singular.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is something we have to get used to and
                we will do so in a way which will ensure that, as public
                representatives, we will not only make a positive contribution
                to reshaping society but enable all sections of the community to
                do likewise as well. They will be allowed to play their part, to
                fulfil their prospects and their capacities, in the private
                sector, where we will become more competitive, productive and
                less reliant on the public sector, and in the voluntary and
                community sector as well. Within that sector people will be able
                to solve many of the difficulties that we have had to contend
                with over the last 30 years and ensure that the voluntary and
                community sector moves towards the much more important and
                productive work of developing the social economy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In taking on these new responsibilities and
                coming to terms with them, we will not just be left with hard
                choices and cold financial management decisions; we will have an
                opportunity to create new, radical public-policy initiatives,
                and both the private-sector and the public-sector economies will
                be healthier as a result.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">May I sympathise with the Minister, who has
                been given the title &quot;the Judas Iscariot of the
                Executive&quot;. I refer, of course, to the fact that he was the
                treasurer for the 12 disciples and held the bag. He will have to
                hold on to the bag very tightly, given some of the things we
                have heard.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister has given a commitment to
                his party in respect of the additional Departments. They agreed
                to the formation of 10 Departments, conditional on their cost
                being neutral over the lifetime of the Assembly. What progress
                has been made in the Budget for next year to move towards that
                neutrality of cost?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister said that there would have to be
                very careful management on the parts of all Ministers to ensure
                that spending matched the resources available. Has he conveyed
                that message to the Minister of Education, who, although he
                might look like Art Garfunkel, is sounding more like Abba
                singing ‘Money, Money, Money’? Last week, in the space of
                two days, he promised to spend money on rural schools, on Irish
                schools, on integrated schools, on capital funding and on
                abolishing the 11-plus. Will the additional £87 million that
                the Department of Education will have next year fund all of
                that, or will the Minister be sent on a basic adult-education
                course to learn how to count?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Regarding the additional costs of the new

                try to neutralize those costs over the lifetime of the first
                Assembly. That commitment was not just given by the First
                Minister to his party; it is one that we gave to the Assembly.
                We cannot do that with next year’s Budget as we intend to go
                ahead with the plans that we inherited, which divide the money
                among the new Departments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In accommodating the costs of the new
                structures — the new Departments, the North/South

                costs will not affect the budgeted programmes for next year
                under the comprehensive spending review. That should be
                understood and appreciated. How we achieve neutralisation and,
                indeed, greater efficiency and effectiveness in our
                administrative structures or programme systems will have to be
                worked out in the programme of government. We will be
                undertaking that work in the context of the next Treasury
                review, which will be informed by the whole shift to resource
                budgeting.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We will be approaching many things from a
                different angle, and I hope we will be able to achieve savings
                that will go further than the target of neutralising the extra
                costs. It would be wrong for me to go any further at this stage,
                as I am only one Minister in an Executive which will be carrying
                out the wider review.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sammy&nbsp;Wilson referred to my remarks
                about the Budget for the remainder of this year. Is the Minister
                of Education aware of that? Yes, he is. Our approach to the rest
                of this year’s Budget and next year’s was agreed by all the
                Ministers in the Executive Committee. It will be very difficult
                for Ministers to manage this, and I hope that all Committee
                members — even Rottweilers or any other kind of beast — as
                they deal with Ministers and contribute in their Committees,
                will appreciate that. It should also be appreciated that the
                amount allocated to the Department of Education for next year,
                which Mr&nbsp;Wilson referred to when he talked about the
                Education Minister’s running around making promises that extra
                money would be put into schools, includes an extra £22 million
                for the schools capital programme. That is provided for in the
                Budget.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McHugh:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Chathaoirligh, I welcome the Minister’s
                speech. It is rather unsatisfactory that I received a copy of
                the public expenditure plans just this morning and have had very
                little time to look at them.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.30 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My question concerns the flexibility of this
                year’s Budget and how much movement is possible within it.
                Probably very little. How much room for manoeuvre is there in an
                economic plan for the North, and to what extent is the west
                being considered in comparison with everywhere else? Any action
                that is taken will be within the terms of the present plan,
                which has not been finalised — there is still some room for
                consultation over the ‘Shaping our Future’ document.
                However, I am concerned that the west may not be looked after.
                That document points to major development along the main
                transport corridors, and much of the housing is directed towards
                Craigavon and areas around Belfast. It seems that people are
                shifting from rural areas to the larger towns, and this will not
                help us to get small businesses in rural areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am worried that we will be bound in with
                this plan for the next 25 years, that we will not be able to
                move away from it and that it will in some way be able to limit
                any plans developed by the Assembly. Is there flexibility in the
                present Budget to do something about these matters in the rural
                areas? Does the Minister look forward to having something in
                place so that the area west of the Bann will be looked after?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the cross-border institutions, the
                all-Ireland institutions and those issues in ‘Shaping Our
                Future’ that dovetail with the national development plan for
                the South, whose economic plan will not be available for another
                two years.</p>
                <b>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order. Perhaps the Member would ask his
                question. He should not be making a speech.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McHugh:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to know what flexibility there is
                within the Budget constraints and what the Minister sees in the
                plan for the west of the Bann next year?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Member for his many points and
                questions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Flexibility in the Budget will come about
                only if there is very strict discipline in its management. If we
                run the Budget tightly we may get easements which will give us
                some flexibility.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member said that the Budget and the
                statement were available only this morning. That is not unusual
                with exercises of this type. The Budget was finally agreed in
                the Executive Committee only yesterday, and work still had to be
                done on some of the figures. Information has been provided in as
                timely a fashion as possible, but I appreciate the Member’s
                concern.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will be meeting with the Finance and
                Personnel Committee this afternoon to discuss many of these
                issues. All the Committees will be able to look at their
                respective programmes and allocations, and we will provide more
                detailed figures for them. This is not a hit-and-run Budget that
                everybody is stuck with. There will be consultation, input and
                scrutiny, but we will have to make final decisions early in the
                New&nbsp;Year, as Departments need to be able to deal with their
                secondary and end budgets, so that they can plan for next year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In terms of the geographic balance, the
                Member referred to ‘Shaping Our Future’, which appeared to
                dovetail with the national development plan in the South. That
                is probably so on a variety of levels.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member appeared to criticise some of the
                measures covered in the Budget in terms of their locations.
                Measures to deal with locations across Northern Ireland are also
                compatible with ‘Shaping Our Future’, so we cannot say that
                we like the document at one level but that we should not abide
                by it at another.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am sympathetic to the Member’s point
                about the west. This is a natural reaction — I come from
                there. I have taken a Pledge of Office which obliges me to serve
                all the people of Northern Ireland equally, and I am determined
                to uphold that pledge. With regard to future Budgets, we need to
                make sure that public-spending plans, the development of public
                policy and the management of public services are informed by the
                twin ethics of quality and equality. In the programme of
                government we must find more ways of enabling us to ensure that
                people can see quality and equality at the forefront of all
                plans, including those for public expenditure, and in their
                outcomes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As an Assembly we will have to address the
                concept of resource budgeting and its focus on outcomes. As I
                said last week to the Finance and Personnel Committee, resource
                budgeting should be tailored to our needs rather than dealt with
                on a hand-me-down basis from the Assembly. So when we are
                focusing on the outcome requirements of resource accounting and
                budgeting we must factor in equality considerations as well and
                give appropriate weightings to them. We must work on this issue
                in the longer term, not just in the context of the programme of
                government but throughout the working of the Assembly itself.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Birnie:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I congratulate the Finance Minister on his
                first Budget. It was commendably concise — not of Gladstonian
                proportions. Indeed, Members will not have to tear it up, unlike
                Mr&nbsp;McCreevy’s recent productions in Dublin.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the end of page 5 of the report the
                Minister speaks of ongoing consultation with regard to the
                European Union funds. As a party we agree about the value of
                that, and almost all Members would stress its importance.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Can the Minister outline what lessons have
                been learned from the experience of the European structural fund
                rounds of 1989-93 and 1994-99 which will be taken forward to
                inform the new round of funding between next year and the year
                2006?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, the Minister refers — again at
                the end of page 5 — to the peace programme as a unique scheme.
                I assume that that is partly a reference to the additionality
                aspect of funding, so I would like to know what lessons have
                been learned from the previous special programme for peace and
                reconciliation and, in particular, about the sustainability of
                funded projects, which will be taken forward to the new round of
                funding next year.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, in relation to the structural funds,
                we must continue consultation on the proposals for making the
                best use of them. Because of time and process requirements the
                Secretary of State had already submitted a plan to Brussels
                prior to devolution.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am quite clear, as is my Department, that
                the plan is necessarily flexible and is structured in such a way
                as to allow the new institutions sufficient latitude to ensure
                that the precise balance of the programme is well informed by
                our particular priorities and by the needs we are trying to
                serve.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of course, we will have to ensure that we
                take account of the EU’s requirements. It will have its own
                particular requirements with regard to the balance of that
                programme. The money is not ours to use as we wish; we will have
                to use it in accordance with the programme priorities of the
                European Union.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to building on the lessons
                learned from previous programmes, that has, to a degree, already
                been taken account of in the submitted plan. Some people argue
                that one plan is too much like the other. That is one of the
                reasons why we are being so protective of the whole concept of
                flexibility.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Birnie was correct about the peace
                programme. The finance is additional, and that very fact makes
                it unique. That does not mean that it is money to be frittered
                away, and we do not treat it as a feel-good fund. We are
                concerned about the concept of sustainability. With regard to
                the peace programme, we are trying to ensure that we balance the
                regeneration and reconciliation needs in ways that are
                sustainable and effective. We want regeneration and
                reconciliation to move together, almost like a piston driving an
                engine forward. This is the approach we intend to take. It is
                not a matter of economic development versus social inclusion;
                rather it is a matter of economic development and social
                inclusion working together to bring reconciliation and
                regeneration to those areas that can best capitalise on such
                benefits. We understand that social inclusion does not happen on
                its own and that it is a feature of economic inclusion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Therefore, to ensure sustainable social
                inclusion we must have programmes which help to sustain ongoing
                economic inclusion. We will have to try to achieve that balance.
                It will not be an easy task. The social partners have different
                pressures and priorities, and there is also the very important
                perspective of local government and its role.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We shall have to try to manage the existing
                flexibility in the structural fund plan and the peace programme
                in ways that meet the competing preferences and priorities of
                different interests, and we will have to do that over the coming
                months.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr William McCrea:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In his response to an earlier question, the
                Minister referred to the £8 million cost of the North/South
                Ministerial Council’s implementation bodies. The impression
                given was that that was the complete cost. Is the Minister
                referring to the cost to the Assembly, which is only a portion
                of the total cost since the Dáil has to provide a similar
                amount?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Why should the urgent infrastructure
                connections, which have been neglected by Governments for many
                years, be linked to the sale of the port of Belfast? If those
                finances are not available and realised, will the Member, as the
                Minister of Finance and Personnel, attempt to direct savings
                from the Assembly’s block funding to fill the gap? The people
                west of the Bann cannot be put at any further disadvantage.</p>

                the Exchequer?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, with regard to the North/South bodies,
                the figure before the Assembly is the cost of our programme. It
                might be helpful to make the point that our cost for these
                bodies is £8.2&nbsp;million. The cost for the Republic of
                Ireland is £25&nbsp;million. That is a ratio of about 3:1. I
                indicated that we were not paying more than our fair share. Let
                us remember that there are also economic and service benefits to
                be derived from these bodies. I hope that there will also be
                savings as a result of co-operation in wider areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, we have inherited plans that
                provide for some key infrastructural projects to be undertaken
                based on the receipts from the sale of the port of Belfast. For
                the time being we are dealing with those inherited plans.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For the programme of government we will have
                to plan on a different basis. This planning will be a lot
                easier, and we will have more leeway and more scope for
                creativity if we already have the receipts for Belfast harbour
                and can proceed with that work.</p>

                Ministers. This is a statement to the House, which may be

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The only authorised designation is
                &quot;MLA&quot; — &quot;Member of the Legislative
                Assembly&quot;. That, of course, does not mean that Members may
                not describe themselves in another way. Members often describe
                themselves — and even more frequently other Members — in all
                sorts of ways. <i>[Laughter] </i>These may be authoritative and
                even accurate, but they are not authorised by the Standing
                Orders.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am, I regret to say, neither a student of
                nor in any way familiar with the Irish language or even
                Ulster-Scots. However, seeing that these matters were being
                raised in the press, I looked into them a little. I cannot offer
                an authorised version, as it were. However, my understanding is
                that were this a Parliament duly recognised and described as
                such, the term &quot;Teachta Dála&quot;, abbreviated to
                &quot;TD&quot;, would be appropriate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However — and the Minister referred earlier
                to the negotiations and what went on there — all Members are
                aware that such matters were part of the negotiations. The
                decision was made that this would be described as an Assembly,
                not as a Parliament. Therefore, as I understand it, the term
                &quot;Teachta Dála&quot; would not be appropriate. This is a
                legislative assembly, and its Members are described as MLAs, as,
                in many cases, are the Members of the provincial Assemblies in
                Canada and the state Assemblies in Australia.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So far as any abbreviations are concerned, I
                understand that for &quot;Member of the Legislative
                Assembly&quot; the term &quot;Teachta&quot; would be quite
                appropriate. This has come to be the term used, I understand,
                for a political representative — a Member of an Assembly. The
                word that is used to describe this Assembly in the Irish version
                of the agreement is &quot;Tionól&quot;, not &quot;Dáil&quot;.
                Since this is a legislative Assembly, I understand, the word
                &quot;Reachtach&quot; would be appropriate to describe
                &quot;legislative&quot;. It would be &quot;Teachta den Tionól
                Reachtach&quot; or &quot;TTR&quot;. There is little doubt that
                there are other variations. I do not claim to speak with great
                authority. I understand, for example, that the word &quot;Comhalta&quot;
                rather than &quot;Teachta&quot; would be an appropriate
                translation of &quot;Member&quot;.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to Ulster-Scots, I understand
                that a reasonable translation of &quot;Member of the Legislative
                Assembly &quot; would be &quot;Laa-makin Forgaitherer&quot; —
                &quot;LMF&quot;. If one regards &quot;laa-makin&quot; as a
                hyphenated term, &quot;LF&quot; would be appropriate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These are my best endeavours. I trust that
                they will provide some guidance to Members. Having said that,
                perhaps I may proceed to the appointment of the Heid-yins and
                Deputy Heid-yins of the Committees. <i>[Laughter]</p>

                officers of the four larger parties so wished they could decline

                they do make a nomination, it has to be a member of their own
                party. In the case of the Public Accounts Committee, unlike some
                of the others, that person cannot be a member of the party to
                which the Minister of Finance and Personnel belongs.</p>

                oppositional parties? My party would be prepared to leave that
                position free if the other nominating officers were prepared to

                If nominations had not been made when the 15-minute allowance
                expired, the eventuality that the Member describes would come to
                pass. However, it is not for me nor for Members to engage in
                debate on this matter. Procedurally, what the Member says is

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am now required to supervise the
                appointment of a Chairperson and Deputy Chairperson to each
                Standing Committee. I remind Members of the requirements that
                are set out in Standing Orders. I shall ask the nominating
                officer of each political party, in the order required by the
                formula contained in Standing Orders, to select an available
                Standing Committee and nominate a person who is a member of his
                party and of the Assembly to be its Chairman or deputy Chairman.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have already referred to the requirement
                that the Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the Public Accounts
                Committee shall not be members of the same party as the Minister
                of Finance and Personnel. Nominating Officers shall not prefer,
                for chairmanship or deputy chairmanship, a Committee in which
                they have an interest, which is defined as their party having a
                Minister in charge of the topic to which it relates.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The phrase &quot;shall not prefer&quot; does
                not mean that this cannot happen; it just means that they shall
                not prefer it at the early stage of d’Hondt. One could find
                — for example, at a late stage of d’Hondt — that such
                choices were not available. As there was some uncertainty among
                Members in a previous running of d’Hondt, I should tell the
                House that it is possible that a party might have to prefer a
                deputy chairmanship to a chairmanship. The d’Hondt procedure
                combines chairmanships and deputy chairmanships simply to remain
                within the &quot;shall not prefer&quot; rule. It does not mean
                that parties will miss out on anything.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There have been two changes of nominating
                officer owing to the absence of previous nominating officers.
                Mrs&nbsp;Gerry&nbsp;Cosgrove has advised me that Mr&nbsp;McGrady
                is the nominating officer for the SDLP in this procedure.
                Dr&nbsp;Paisley has advised me that Mr&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;Robinson
                is the nominating officer for the DUP at this time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The timing for nominations is now 15 minutes.
                In the Initial Standing Orders it was five&nbsp;minutes, but
                nominating officers could ask for a break of 15 minutes. I
                assume that when the Standing Orders Committee considered the
                matter it put in the 15&nbsp;minutes to ensure that there would
                be no need to have repeated requests for suspensions of
                15&nbsp;minutes and that Members might be able to consult. Under
                the new Standing Orders, that is the position in any case. If
                the 15&nbsp;minutes were to elapse, whether in the circumstance
                referred to by Mr&nbsp;Ford or in any other, I would be required

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly Commission, under the Northern
                Ireland Act, is charged with making the provisions and providing
                the property, resources and services for the Assembly. As
                Members may recall, in February the Assembly unanimously agreed
                the recommendations of the Senior Salaries Review Body (SSRB).</p>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that Members have had a look at the
                Bill and at the explanatory note, which gives an accurate,
                layman’s version of the measure. I do not intend going into
                great detail; I will simply give the background to some of the
                provisions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill does four things. Essentially it
                enacts the recommendations of the SSRB. Clause 1, for example,
                enacts recommendation 25 of the SSRB’s report, which was that
                a resettlement grant be payable in respect of continuous service
                in the applicable body to any Member of the Scottish Parliament,
                the National Assembly for Wales or the Northern Ireland Assembly
                who, at a general election to that body, does not stand for
                re-election or who stands but is not re-elected.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was further recommended that the formula
                used at Westminster to calculate the level of grants be adopted
                for each of the devolved bodies. Subsections (1) to (4) of
                clause 1 enact that recommendation, and schedule 1 puts in place
                the formula used at Westminster.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clause 2, subsections (1) to (4), enacts
                recommendation 26 of the SSRB report, and clause&nbsp;3,
                subsections&nbsp;(1) to (4), enacts recommendation&nbsp;27. The
                recommendation on winding-up allowances, at paragraph 66 of the
                report, is similarly enacted in clause&nbsp;4. <i>[Interruption]</p>

                exactly what is available at Westminster, where there is
                provision to enable payments to be made to Members who do not
                get re-elected or who may have to retire because ill health
                prevents them from performing their duties. The winding-up
                allowance enables bills for winding up a constituency or other
                legitimate office to be paid if a Member fails to be re-elected.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am aware that this is a Second Stage debate
                and that that is not the same as a determination or a
                ministerial statement. While I am happy to answer questions, the
                precise details of this Bill will be dealt with, clause by
                clause, subsection by subsection, line by line, when it is
                remitted to the Committee stage and sent to the Finance
                Committee. There will be an opportunity then to go through it in

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Chathaoirligh, I do not want to make many
                points. While there is a clear need, in principle, for provision
                for some sort of sickness benefit or redundancy package — we
                have responsibility in that regard — there are some matters in
                the proposed legislation that I am concerned about. I want to
                put it on record that I am not entirely satisfied with
                everything in the Bill as it is at present. However, my party
                does support the need for such a Bill and will deal with it, as
                Mr&nbsp;Fee has advised, at a later stage.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ervine:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not intend to speak for very long.
                Indeed, I am not in a very good frame of mind to speak on this
                issue at all. For me it connotes many things. It deals with
                specific issues and with circumstances which may befall people
                like me. Yesterday there were complaints about the little
                parties who managed to scrape in to be the last of the
                108&nbsp;Assembly Members. That does not apply to me. Neither
                does it apply to, for instance, the Women’s Coalition. Before
                the larger parties look down their noses at small parties they
                might like to look at how many people they had elected in fifth
                and sixth places — especially in sixth place.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I may yet find myself in the difficult
                position of not having been elected. However, what I have to say
                comes not from my personal feeling in respect of this issue but,
                rather, from my sense of anger and hurt that the degree of
                inclusion that was promised in the Good Friday Agreement was
                lost in the Northern Ireland Act — and lost totally when the
                carve-up began. We are talking about allowances to Members, and
                not only in terms of their basic salary. Some of them are or
                will be office holders — Ministers, junior Ministers,
                Committee Chairpersons, Committee Deputy Chairpersons — who
                will all benefit incrementally, potentially for the rest of
                their lives, as a result of a job being doled out to them on the
                basis of patronage.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Just as we were looking at the Assembly
                membership to see who is not in government, or in one of the
                jobs given out by the Government, we heard the leader of Sinn
                Féin ask a foolish question this morning. He asked what a
                totally oppositional party was. Well, in case he has not worked
                it out yet, and in case the DUP has not worked it out yet, let
                me say that it is any party within the Northern&nbsp;Ireland
                Government or Executive — call it what you will. In effect it
                is a Government with executive authority.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All of that brings me to the fact that
                John&nbsp;Fee, for his sins, and Robert&nbsp;Coulter before that
                and Eileen&nbsp;Bell before that again have had to stand here
                and take the flak. They certainly take the flak from the media
                and from the broader populace for the doling out of patronage to
                Assembly Members. It is a legal requirement that we deal with
                these issues, and I am happy to deal with them. It gives me a
                chance to air my serious disquiet at the attitudes emanating
                from the larger parties.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have just seen it — and I am sorry if I
                digress a little — in respect of the nomination for the
                Chairmanship of the Public Accounts Committee. I cast no
                aspersions on the now Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee,
                but the larger parties should have done the honourable thing and
                realised that the best person to scrutinise the Government, the
                one able to do so most openly, would have been somebody in
                opposition — preferably in positive opposition, but certainly
                in opposition.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, that was not to be the case. I
                detect that either the control freaks are at work or patronage
                has to be doled out. And we are about to deal with another case
                in point. We are about to deal with a 17-person Committee, nine
                members of which belong to either the UUP or the SDLP. Anybody
                who has done rudimentary mathematics will be able to work out
                that out of a 17-person Committee, nine is a majority. This
                again smacks of sickening control, and no doubt there will be
                other requests put to the Assembly to pay Chairmen and Deputy
                Chairmen of Committees not yet agreed to. There will be direct
                and severe opposition to this sort of thing — as much as two
                Members can muster.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What happened to the theory of public
                service? I understand the effort that a Minister puts in and the
                business of paying wages that will attract people into politics.
                But what about Chairmen and Deputy Chairmen and the looming
                spectre of paying allowances to Whips?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How far down are we prepared to take this? In
                my spare time I help my secretary to clean the office. Is there
                any chance of getting a couple of bob for that? The amount of
                patronage and the control-freak atmosphere — mostly among the
                Ulster Unionists and the SDLP — are becoming ludicrous. In
                relation to the Commission, Members will recollect
                Gerry&nbsp;Adams being the Pied Piper of the poor, and the DUP
                virtually clearing their Benches so that they would not be
                tainted by such a terrible issue. The Commission reached
                agreement by consensus, so the figures that we are debating are
                as much a decision by the DUP and Sinn Féin as by the Ulster
                Unionist Party, the SDLP and the Alliance Party.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have said that I am unhappy about some
                issues in the legislation. We can agree the principle of
                legislation and argue about the details. That is the purpose of

                The Member will feel disquiet in future over issues that are not
                quite so directed towards individual Members. There is
                consistent narking and arguing in the outside world about who
                gets what, where and when. We are all lumped together, and
                nobody will remember who was on the Commission or who made the
                decisions. Hansard will contain no commentary from the DUP on
                the issue, and the Pied Piper of the poor will have had his
                position written in public.</p>

                public pronouncement if, as Mr&nbsp;Maskey says, they are new
                kids on the block? It was for public consumption, probably in
                much the same way as Mr&nbsp;McCartney’s remarks on the issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are people here who feel aggrieved, but
                not because of what we are not getting. There are only two of
                us, and we did not expect patronage in terms of Chairs, Deputy
                Chairs or Ministries, but we did expect a degree of consultation
                and an absolute understanding, at least in terms of Committees,
                of proper proportionality.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The small parties are not homogeneous. We are
                a very broad church — perhaps more so than the Executive.
                However, when this 17-person Committee hits the Table today it
                will be offered two places for the Opposition. That is in a
                17-person Committee that will oversee the work of the First
                Minister and the Deputy First Minister. It is meant to be a
                scrutiny Committee, but how many people in receipt of patronage
                from the First or Deputy First Minister will be scrutinising
                their work? I guess that nine of them, which is the majority in
                that Committee —</p>

                requires. The Agreement was very clear and sensible about that.
                I do not know if the word &quot;shafted&quot; is parliamentary

                was a cheap shot from a party that is spending £106,000 which
                came to it with devolution. One might have called a point of
                order to find out if it was all right to be in a paid post in
                the Commission and also take a chairmanship, which the larger

                Agreement. The tragedy of this is that I will be maligned and
                misunderstood. People will believe that we want a share of
                something. We wanted to understand what was happening, and we
                wanted inclusivity. At every turn we have seen the large parties
                not adhering to that principle. It is a tragedy that they,
                including the DUP, have not.</p>

                out if there is to be any hope of inclusivity, and I ask the
                larger parties to give this some consideration now. There is an
                experience shared by the larger parties, and, while we may not
                be able to get in the way very much in the Assembly, on the
                ground we can get in the way quite well. We have the capacity to
                be on the hustings, to rap the doors, to work our advice centres
                and to ensure that the larger parties know that politically we
                exist. If they are not doing their jobs properly perhaps we will
                seek some benefit from that.</p>

                people climbing the ladder, being rather disparaging about those
                who had crept in through the back door. Of course, quite a few
                in his party benefited from seats won far lower down the order
                than those won by Members from the smaller parties that I am
                attempting to represent. Is there some design that we make this
                Assembly so expensive, given that it costs £102,000 twice for
                prime-ministerial posts, that when the four-year review comes
                round some of the wee people will be expected to drop off? If I
                were worried about that I would be wondering how much more
                worried some of the UUP, the SDLP, the DUP and Sinn Féin must
                be. If we are talking about who got the sixth seats it does not
                follow that it was Members from the small parties.</p>

                provision will be included in future appropriation Bills.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms McWilliams:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will have a number of questions to which I
                hope Mr&nbsp;Fee can respond in his summing-up, but I want to
                raise some concerns first.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">May I say to Mr Morrow that there is no one
                here surplus to requirements. All Members went out and got a
                mandate. Whether from the Executive or from the Opposition, none
                of them are surplus to requirements.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Morrow:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Speaker. I did not
                say that they were surplus to requirements; I said that they
                were now perceived to be surplus to requirements. Their function
                was to bolster up this regime, but they are no longer used. I do
                not say that in a disparaging way. That is the way they are
                perceived. They are no longer required.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms McWilliams:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members came here in response to the will of
                the people, expressed through a referendum that led to an
                election. Some of those who stood in the election are now in the
                Executive. If they continue to see themselves as surplus to
                requirements they should say so. It is not fair comment to say
                that others are perceived in that way.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the issue of who is in the
                Opposition, it was fair for Mr&nbsp;Robinson to say that his
                party would not be nominating anyone for the Public Accounts
                Committee chairpersonship. I would like to have heard how many
                other parties felt the same way. But that was lost. At all the
                transitional seminars that Assembly Members attended before
                devolution every analyst and international commentator said that
                the chairmanship of the Public Accounts Committee should not be
                held by a person on the Government side. It is a great
                disappointment that parties did not recognise that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have just agreed the Chairpersons and
                Deputy Chairpersons of these Committees, but it has not been
                agreed that they should be paid. So far as I am aware, it will
                require a change of legislation for that to happen. They are at
                present not recognised for payment under the Standing Orders. I
                urge both those Members who became office holders as a result of
                this morning’s nomination under d’Hondt and the parties
                which sit on the Business Committee to take note of the fact
                that all our decisions reflect on what happens in each of the
                Departments. I make that comment particularly in response to the
                comments of the Minister of Finance and Personnel. This is a
                public expenditure issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The members of the Commission should once
                again review the difference between what was recommended by the
                Senior Salaries Review Body, which is independent, and the final
                result, particularly in relation to payment to the members of
                the Commission.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to the resettlement allowance for
                Members, the memorandum accompanying the Bill states</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;This gives a resettlement allowance
                varying, for example, between six months’ pay for a Member
                standing down from the Assembly aged below 50, to one year’s
                salary for a Member standing down between age 55 to 64 with 15
                or more years’ service.&quot;</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the 15 or more years’ service apply
                only to the latter age group or to both?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In my role as an Assembly Commissioner I do
                not know that I have the competence to respond to much of what
                has been said, and I do not intend to do so. We shall have to
                respond in writing to Ms&nbsp;McWilliams’s final question. The
                arrangements that we are putting in place are outlined in the
                schedule to the Bill and are precisely the same as those that
                apply in Westminster and, I understand, in Scotland and Wales.
                We would need to study this table to work out precisely at what
                age and length of service the different levels of percentage
                kick in. We shall write to Ms&nbsp;McWilliams on that point.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I detected no other detailed questions during
                the debate, and I know that the Bill will go to the Finance
                Committee if it gets a Second Stage. I thank the Minister of

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly needs to make provision urgently
                to take account of the fact that the arrangements for giving
                financial assistance to political parties fell with devolution.
                There is no authority under the Northern Ireland Act for the
                Assembly Commission to make payments to political parties, and
                this Bill appears to the Assembly Commission to be the only
                legal mechanism for ensuring two things. First, it enables us to
                continue, in the short term, to make provision for political
                parties. Secondly, it enables us to introduce a requirement that
                the Assembly Commission, in consultation with all Members of the
                Assembly, bring forward a new, detailed scheme under the Bill
                before 31&nbsp;March&nbsp;1999.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are only four clauses in the Bill. The
                first one is permissive — it allows the Assembly Commission to
                make payments to the parties. The second places a requirement on
                the Commission to bring forward a scheme before 31 March 1999.
                The clause on transition agreements would approve an arrangement
                whereby the Assembly Commission would continue to pay the
                political parties at the same rates as applied before
                devolution. That is a short-term measure to allow us to ensure
                sure that over Christmas and the new year the parties will
                continue to get financial support to pay their staff and the
                running costs of their offices.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The real import of the Bill is that it will
                require a new scheme to be designed by the Commission. I am
                aware that many parties are not happy with the existing scheme
                and that the old scheme did not make provision for all sorts of
                contingencies. In my view this Bill will enable Members to
                devise a decent, proper and equitable scheme in the new year,
                which will properly provide support for the political parties.</p>
