                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b><font SIZE="3">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </font></b><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have received a letter this morning from
                the Secretary of State, which I wish to draw to the attention of
                the House. The letter reads as follows:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;It was with very great regret that I
                made the Order this morning to suspend the devolved
                institutions, in order to stabilise the current political
                situation in Northern Ireland. It was clear that it was not for
                the time being possible to hold together an inclusive
                power-sharing Executive, since the confidence within the
                community necessary to underpin it had broken down.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I nevertheless believe the Agreement has
                delivered enormous benefits, and points the way forward. I and
                my ministerial team will seek to carry forward good government
                within Northern Ireland, to work with the Irish Government and
                the parties to restore the devolved institutions as soon as we
                can, and to remove once and for all concerns about the
                commitment to exclusively democratic and peaceful means.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to work energetically in the economic
                and social fields. Though I hope suspension will be brief, there
                are serious problems to be dealt with and it would be wrong to
                approach matters simply as caretakers. We shall be assisted in
                taking forward our work by the great achievements that have been
                brought about by all parties within the Assembly and the
                Executive. Despite the tensions, I believe the period of
                devolution was a great success, and a great advance for Northern
                Ireland. We must get back as soon as possible to the position
                where people in Northern Ireland are in charge of their own
                affairs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With suspension, the Assembly and its
                committees can no longer meet. We hope suspension will be
                short-lived, and we recognise that Assembly Members should, for
                the time being, continue to represent their constituencies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But I believe there will be an expectation
                that the removal of the Assembly’s core functions must be
                reflected in arrangements for it and its members. We envisage
                therefore, with effect from next month, bringing Assembly
                members’ salaries back to the levels that applied in the
                shadow period (adjusted for subsequent increases to date). We
                shall immediately review closely the allowances that are paid in
                the Assembly, from the same perspective. Assembly members will
                for the present continue to have access to Parliament Buildings
                in order to carry out their constituency work.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But if the Assembly remains without its
                essential responsibilities, I believe these arrangements will
                need to be looked at again. We shall therefore review the
                situation by the end of the year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly has an impressive record to its
                credit. It has been a forum for dialogue between different
                strains of political thought unprecedented in Northern Ireland,
                but essential to our future. Its committees have been diligent
                in holding the Executive to account, to the great benefit of
                public administration. If I may say so, I admire the way you
                yourself have guided it in the most tense situations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must do all we can to restore it, and the
                other institutions, as soon as possible. I shall do all I can to
                bring that about.&quot;</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Signed by the Secretary of State.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr Ian Paisley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker, will you inform the House if the
                Secretary of State talked to you about the letter before you
                received it? If that was not so, is it not a matter of grave
                discourtesy on his part that he did not consult with you at the
                same time as he consulted with party leaders?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to payments, can you confirm that
                the salaries of those who are now employed in party offices and
                registered as workers in those offices for Members of the
                Assembly will remain as they are, just as your salary will
                remain as it is?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, the Secretary of State has written to
                me, and I fully expect that there will be further communication.
                However, in direct response to the Member’s question, it was
                obviously much more important that he communicate with party
                leaders, such as the Member, rather than with me.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As for concerns about the other arrangements
                to which the Member refers, I cannot immediately be more clear
                than by recounting the content of the letter from the Secretary
                of State. However, it may be of assistance if I remind Members
                of some of the administrative arrangements that there were
                during the previous suspension, particularly in view of some of
                the Member’s comments. Clearly there were some
                misunderstandings, and I shall seek to correct at least one of
                them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the previous situation, direct rule was
                reinstated and the Assembly remained in place, but the Assembly
                and its Committees could not meet or discuss business, and that
                included the Assembly Commission. Those in elected office —
                Ministers, junior Ministers, Chairpersons and Deputy
                Chairpersons of Statutory Committees — could no longer hold
                office. Participation in the North/South Ministerial Council and
                the British-Irish Council was suspended. No functions could be
                conferred on implementation bodies. Members had the usual access
                to Parliament Buildings. Members’ salaries were abated to the
                pre-devolution level, and the office cost allowances were also
                abated to the pre-devolution level, but not until the end of
                that financial year. Party allowance was reduced, and that
                obviously might have a bearing, if it were mirrored on this
                occasion, on the Member’s question about party staff, but I
                cannot give him any more enlightenment on that, for I have none
                myself. The childcare allowance was not affected.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Speaker continued to hold office, but his
                salary was abated to pre-devolution level, and I have no
                expectation that it will be otherwise on this occasion, Dr
                Paisley — unless, in your conversation with the Secretary of
                State, you put a good word in for me. I am sure that it would
                carry heavily, were you to do so.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Committee Chairpersons and Deputy
                Chairpersons did not receive salaries for their work in chairing
                Committees. Some other measures, which were not referred to in
                the correspondence from the previous Secretary of State, came
                into place during the last suspension. The Secretary of State
                discharged the functions of the First Minister and the Deputy
                First Minister. During the first six months of suspension,
                legislation on devolved matters was made by Order in Council at
                Westminster, and the Secretary of State could extend that for
                periods of up to six months if required. Northern Ireland
                Departments discharged their functions subject to the direction
                and control of the Secretary of State, who appointed NIO
                Ministers to look after those functions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As far as the Assembly Commission was
                concerned, its functions were taken over directly by the
                Secretary of State, and the accounting officer gave account of
                his functions in that way.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I trust that that gives some clarity on some
                of the important matters that the Member raised.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr Ian Paisley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will you clarify the standing of the
                intergovernmental bodies? There has been a lot of discussion in
                the press about their going from strength to strength, but from
                what you read out, I think that such progress will be limited by
                the agreement, which I have been reading this morning.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As far as I am concerned, my responsibility
                is to try to interpret the procedures of this House.
                Interpretation of the agreement goes well beyond that.
                Foreseeing what politicians at any level may choose to do
                subsequent to today would require a prophet not a Speaker, and,
                as the Member knows, I am not even the son of a prophet; I am
                just the son of a poor Presbyterian minister.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr C Wilson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is unfortunate that the Secretary of State
                did not take the opportunity to declare the suspension of the
                Executive and the Assembly Committees in the House. That might
                have given Members an opportunity to explore with him his
                comment on the Assembly’s great achievements. It would be
                interesting to hear how he would manage to put a spin on that.
                In the wider community, there is cause to acknowledge the great
                achievement that will occur when the House rises and we see an
                end to the terms of the two Sinn Féin Ministers. It is cause
                for rejoicing in Northern Ireland —</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is it not ironic that on the day on which the

                he is about contributing to the welfare of our senior citizens

                recorded in Hansard. During the debate on the review of
                post-primary education on Tuesday 8 October, the Minister of
                Education, in reference to the transfer test, said:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Within days of that statement, the Minister
                acted arbitrarily to abolish the 11-plus. Given his conduct, his
                approach to the House and his subsequent actions, is that a

                Time to ask questions of the Minister. It remains to be seen
                whether what he said to the House, as recorded in Hansard, or
                what he said outside the House, as recorded and advised by the

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Further to that point of order, Mr Speaker.
                Perhaps you can inform the House whether the Executive ratified
                the highly cynical and highly political decision that the
                Minister of Education made to declare a date for the ending of
                the 11-plus tests. Indeed, was that decision even raised with
                the Executive? If not, does the Minister have the power to make
                such a decision without reference to the Executive, the
                Committee for Education or the Assembly, as was promised by the
                First Minister? Is this yet another example of the First
                Minister breaking a promise, particularly as he told us that
                IRA/Sinn Féin Ministers would be held to account and would not
                be able to act as despots?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order. Again, if the Member chooses, he may
                ask appropriate supplementary questions of the Minister this
                afternoon if the opportunity arises for him.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I cannot say whether this was a matter agreed
                by the Executive or not; that is clearly a matter for the
                Executive. As far as procedure is concerned, it is my
                understanding — but no more than that — that developments of
                policy in this way are matters to be agreed by the Executive.
                The Member may care to raise directly with the Minister or other
                Members of the Executive whether the Executive agreed that
                matter.</p>
                <b>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Speaker. On 24 July
                the Secretary of State told the House of Commons that he would
                not hesitate to send to you — and, through you, to the Floor
                of the House — a motion to exclude Sinn Féin/IRA if it was
                found to be in further breach of its obligations. Has the
                Secretary of State raised that possibility with you, and have
                you discussed it?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Furthermore, can you say whether any other
                parties have signed the exclusion motion, currently in the
                Business Office, designed to exclude IRA/Sinn Féin? Outside the
                House, I hear parties, particularly the Ulster Unionist Party,
                calling for the exclusion of Sinn Féin/IRA, but they are
                failing to take the steps necessary to have the matter debated
                in the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Can you tell the House whether the matters
                listed in today’s Order Paper that relate to legislation will
                be taken today despite the Assembly’s imminent suspension?
                When suspension kicks in, what will happen to the legislation
                that is currently in Committee or on the Floor of the House?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member will understand that it is not
                normally my practice to describe discussions that have, or have
                not, taken place with the Secretary of State, Ministers or
                parties. It is wise for me to maintain that practice. However, I
                can confirm to the Member and to the House that I have not
                received any such exclusion motion from the Secretary of State
                under the relevant section.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not aware precisely which Members have
                or have not signed a motion on the No Day Named List, but that
                is a matter of public record; there is no obstruction to any
                Member looking at the names that are on that list. If they wish
                to make account of that, that is entirely a matter for
                themselves, not for me. It would, of course, be a matter for the
                Business Committee, and the Member is familiar with the
                procedure to be followed if there are sufficient signatures.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to today’s Order Paper, we
                shall simply proceed in the normal fashion, as is proper, and, I
                trust, in the normal congenial, courteous and parliamentary
                fashion in which Members have been in the habit of conducting
                themselves here, doing our duty and fulfilling our
                responsibilities to those who have elected us.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am considering the matter of the status of
                legislation, but I have one or two comments to make. First, it
                seems to me that during the period of suspension, it will be as
                though that legislation were frozen, and it may well be that at
                the end of suspension, it can be taken up as though the clock
                had stopped and were restarted — in the same way as is the
                case with ministerial office and chairmanship of Committees, and
                so forth. However, I say that not as a ruling, because I want to
                look more fully at the legalities of that. If we find ourselves
                in that circumstance, I will then give an appropriate ruling.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, it is entirely possible that the
                Secretary of State and his Ministers may regard some of the
                legislation that has been partly carried through the Assembly as
                being of such importance, timeliness or urgency that they may
                choose to convert it into a form in which it might suitably be
                passed at Westminster, should they acquire the necessary
                parliamentary time. If that were to be the case, naturally such
                legislation carried through would fall when the Assembly
                returned. That is the best guidance I can give the Member and
                the House in the present circumstances.</p>

                has not proceeded. Last week we were told that the two junior
                Ministers were not in a position to move the business because
                the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister were not in the
                Chamber. The junior Ministers have obviously been trusted with
                the onerous job of not moving the motion, so they have been
                trusted with something.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is outrageous that, for two weeks in a
                row, this item has been listed on the Order Paper and, for two
                weeks in a row, it has gone absolutely nowhere. We have the two
                junior Ministers from OFMDFM telling us that the motion is not
                moved. The important point I want to make is that, as
                Mr&nbsp;Billy Hutchinson has said, and as many Members will
                agree, the motion is not being moved today because the Ministers
                know that it would not be approved. It would not pass through
                the House. The clear message that should be given to any
                Minister who may take over this responsibility is that there is
                a groundswell of opinion in the House against the contents of

                Of course it is regrettable if matters are tabled on an Order

                them. I suspect that, in the greater scheme of things, it is one
                of the less regrettable things about today, but that is another
                matter. With regard to the question of support, I cannot rule on

                such suspensions can take place only at midnight; there might be
                a question of whether it was midnight tonight, midnight last
                night, or midnight on another night, but they must take place at

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order. I am sure that the House is grateful
                to the Member for confirming when the decision was taken. As for
                the question of how much support or otherwise there is for the
                Bill, the reasoned amendment or whatever, I can say only what I
                have said already — there cannot be an assumption of any
                particular support or lack of support, save for one particular
                fact, which is that the petition of concern contained 32
                signatures. Other than that, no assumption can be made about
                support for any matter that has not come before the House and
                been voted on in the usual way.</p>

                motion must receive cross-community support in order for
                approval to be granted? Will you confirm that such
                cross-community support is also required for the House to

                petition of concern has been certified as valid and has been
                received in due time, it postpones the vote and requires it to
                have cross-community support. The Member is correct that the

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The draft code was laid before the Assembly
                on 24 September 2002 and is subject to affirmative resolution.
                On approval by the Assembly the draft code becomes the code, and
                the Department will make an Order bringing it into effect on the
                appointed day.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The draft code is issued under article 95 of
                the Industrial Relations (Northern Ireland) Order 1992, which
                gives the Department power, subject to Assembly approval, to
                issue codes for the purpose of improving industrial relations.
                The draft code takes account of the current legislative
                provisions on industrial action ballots and notice to employers,
                including those contained in the Employment Relations (Northern
                Ireland) Order 1999. It is intended as a practical instrument to
                assist a range of individuals and organisations, including
                employers, trade unions and employees, to regulate and improve
                industrial relations. It also provides guidance on statutory
                rights.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The draft code is relevant to any union
                involved in industrial action ballots, to employers who are
                affected by them and to union members who may be asked to vote.
                The draft code seeks to ensure that appropriate action is taken
                to resolve disputes before industrial action. It sets out
                details of best practice on whether a ballot is appropriate, how
                to prepare for a ballot, the specific process and steps to be
                followed when holding a ballot, and what action should be taken
                following a ballot. It provides helpful summaries of what the
                current legislation requires by way of consultation by the
                employer and the unions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The draft code does not impose legal
                obligations, and failure to observe it does not render anyone
                liable to proceedings. However, it may be admissible in evidence
                before an industrial tribunal or the industrial court, if it is
                deemed to be relevant. Full consultation has taken place in
                Northern Ireland on the content of the draft code. I commend the
                draft code to the Assembly.</p>

                improving industrial relations. The draft code is a revision of
                an existing code of practice on disciplinary procedures and
                practices in employment that was issued by the Labour Relations
                Agency in November 1990.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The draft code will replace the old one. The
                main reason for the revision is the need for the draft code to
                take account of a legislative change. Article 12 of the
                Employment Relations (Northern Ireland) Order 1999 provided for
                a new statutory right for individuals to be accompanied at
                certain disciplinary and grievance hearings. That right came
                into effect on 2 June 2002. The draft code gives practical
                guidance to employers, workers and workers’ representatives
                who are involved in grievance and disciplinary matters.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In every organisation there should be clearly
                understood arrangements and principles, however simple, which
                are consistent with the underlying intentions set out in the
                draft code. The draft code addresses disciplinary issues
                relating to problems of conduct or performance and how employers
                seek to address them. It provides guidance on the practices and
                procedures that could, and indeed, in some instances should, be
                followed. It considers how employers can best handle the
                grievances that individuals bring to them and provides guidance
                on the statutory right of workers to be accompanied at a
                disciplinary or grievance hearing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The code highlights the best practice
                principles in terms of rules and procedures. It outlines
                appropriate structures and the balance between formal and
                informal processes, provides guidance on how decisions should be
                made and recorded, and suggests timescales by which formal
                warnings may be regarded as spent. The impact assessment
                undertaken on the draft code concludes that it will not
                disadvantage any of the groups specified in section 75 of the
                Northern Ireland Act 1998; nor will it place any additional
                costs on employers. It will have a positive impact in the
                workplace.</p>

                considered the draft code at its meeting on Thursday 3 October
                2002. As the Minister said, the code is being introduced as a
                replacement for an existing code of practice, and it attempts to
                give helpful guidance to employers and employees. It is based on
                a similar code in Great Britain produced by the Advisory,
                Conciliation and Arbitration Service, which is the GB equivalent
                of the Labour Relations Agency. Therefore the production of the
                code maintains parity with Great Britain. As the Minister said,
                the regulatory and equality impact assessments have judged the
                code favourably. I urge the House to support the motion.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The draft code was laid before the Assembly
                on 24 September 2002, and it is subject to the Assembly’s
                approval. The draft code is issued under article 90 of the
                Industrial Relations (Northern Ireland) Order 1992, which,
                subject to departmental and Assembly approval, gives the Labour
                Relations Agency power to issue codes for the purpose of
                improving industrial relations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The draft code is a revision of an existing
                code of practice on redundancy consultation and procedures that
                was issued in September 1998. The revisions take account of
                changes to the legislative provisions on consultation and
                collective redundancies as a consequence of the enactment of the
                Collective Redundancies and Transfer of Undertakings (Protection
                of Employment) (Amendment) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1999.
                The draft code will replace the old one. On approval by the
                Assembly, this draft code becomes the code, and the Department
                will make an Order bringing it into effect on an appointed day.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members will agree that all organisations
                must adapt to economic and technological change in order to
                remain viable. Sometimes this may necessitate a change in their
                employment requirements with regard to the numbers and skills of
                the employees involved. In circumstances where redundancy
                becomes necessary, employers should recognise the damaging
                effects this may have on employees and should, therefore, handle
                redundancies with due care and consideration.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The aim of the code is to provide best
                practice guidance on redundancies — from early consultation
                about the likelihood of redundancies to the management of the
                process. It seeks to encourage all organisations to agree a
                framework within which a change in employment may be handled
                fairly, effectively and comprehensibly. The code seeks to ensure
                that employers are aware of their statutory obligations and
                employees of their entitlements under the relevant legislation.
                The code also gives guidance on the main features of a
                redundancy procedure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In every organisation there should be clearly
                understood arrangements and principles, however simple, which
                are consistent with the underlying intentions set out in the
                draft code. The draft code provides summaries of what the
                current legislation requires by way of consultation by the
                employer with employees or their representatives when a
                redundancy situation is proposed, including such matters as the
                election of representatives, if necessary. It suggests ways of
                reducing or avoiding compulsory redundancies, sets out the
                principles of fair selection of those to be made redundant and
                outlines the rights of an employee when under notice of
                redundancy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The impact assessments undertaken on the
                draft code conclude that it will not disadvantage any of the
                section 75 groups; it will place no additional costs on
                employers; and it will have a positive impact in the workplace.
                Although failure to observe any provision of the draft code does
                not of itself render anyone liable to proceedings, it may be
                admissible in evidence in any proceedings before an industrial
                tribunal or the industrial court if it is deemed to be relevant.
                I commend the draft code to the Assembly.</p>

                consultation does not become one of personal interest to myself
                and other MLAs. Seriously, it is an important issue. As the
                Minister rightly said, it is important that codes of practice be
                in place to attempt to achieve best practice in the field of
                industrial relations. The draft code is unique to Northern
                Ireland, but it revises an existing Northern Ireland code. The
                regulatory and equality impact assessments have been favourable
                in this case. I urge the House to support the motion.</p>

                steps and announced my commitment to abolish the transfer test
                as soon as is practical. I am absolutely determined that my
                decision to abolish the test will not be thwarted by political
                developments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On 11 October I announced that the last tests
                will be held in 2004. That decision allows my Department to
                proceed with work with our key education partners to build on
                the emerging consensus and to develop new arrangements finally
                to consign the transfer test to history. To allow the suspension
                of the Assembly to delay the abolition of the test and the
                development of new post-primary arrangements would only prolong
                the unfairness and inequalities of the current system, and I am
                not prepared to countenance that.</p>

                his own recent survey? Is it not the case that his decision was

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Two thirds of those who returned the
                household response form supported the retention of academic
                selection. Those views are important and will be taken into
                account. However, they cannot be considered to be fully
                representative of the wider public, because only 16% of the
                population responded to the household survey. The response rate
                from well-off areas was almost three times greater than that
                from the poorest areas. Responses from the parents of
                grammar-school pupils were over-represented by more than 50%,
                given the proportion of children who attend grammar schools.</p>

                The position they have now adopted is an about-turn from their
                previous position when consulted on the household response form,

                sought on complex issues which many of the respondents will have
                a limited knowledge or understanding of. While it may be a
                useful exercise to encourage some sort of feedback it may not be
                appropriate to rely on or cite the results as clear and
                unequivocal support for certain proposals or a particular way

                now citing them in support of their case. That is the lowest
                form of political point-scoring on an issue of the highest
                importance. From the outset, I have made it clear that the
                consultation would be multi-stranded and account would be taken
                of responses to all of the strands, and I am sticking to that
                commitment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In contrast to the political point-scoring by
                the UUP and the DUP, I have given clear leadership to the
                education sector by announcing a date for the end of these
                iniquitous tests. That will provide the impetus to develop new
                arrangements, and my Department will be working with its key
                education partners to take that work forward by building on the
                consensus that has emerged from the consultation. <i>[Interruption].</p>

                fully comprehensive school system, operating on the basis of
                catchment areas. There was broad support from our education
                partners — all the education and library boards, the Council
                for Catholic Maintained Schools, the teachers’ unions and
                others — for a system of informed election, whereby parents
                and pupils consider information and advice about the pupil and
                the range of educational opportunities and courses available and
                choose or elect which courses or institutions to apply for
                admission to. Whatever structure is put in place must enable all
                pupils to have educational provision that meets their individual
                learning needs and enables them to fulfil their potential. That

                of the west bank for many years. During the past 30 years the
                school has had no choice but to try to find a site on the east
                bank of the river. During the 1970s and 1980s many Protestants
                were forced to leave the west bank because of Republican
                violence, and they continue to do so. Will the Minster confirm
                that there was no opposition to the school’s moving to the
                east bank? Has a new site been identified on the east bank?</p>

                a long-term enrolment figure of 740 pupils as appropriate for

                However, following a request from the school to introduce
                post-16 provision, that figure is currently under review.</p>

                policy to increase the number of places at schools, with the
                consequential implications for capital expenditure, simply to
                cater for demand, while places are available in other suitable
                schools within reasonable distance.</p>

                instructing the Department to give that top priority, so that

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are two difficulties with regard to the
                future. One is obvious in today’s context; the other is that,
                on an increasing number of issues, Members have asked about
                disaggregating the information to a level which simply is not
                possible. It is difficult to acquire the information, and it
                would place the system under added pressure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to improving the service, it was
                precisely because this was such a difficult matter and because
                there was no publicly funded sub-fertility service, that I
                decided to proceed with an interim service while working on what
                should be provided in future. The interim service provides only
                limited service, based on existing resources. However, I
                emphasise that it enables some couples to have access to
                publicly funded sub-fertility treatment, which, formerly, was

                has most definitely not been put to the bottom of the list
                because of her age. As Ms Morrice knows, right up until I came

                necessarily improve the provision of those services. Measures to
                improve the provision of speciality services include, for
                example, the considerable efforts being made by the Royal Group
                of Hospitals to address current problems, which include the

                between the donor and patient. The nature of the blood typing
                that is required to find an exact match means that hundreds of
                thousands of donors are necessary in order to have a reasonable
                chance of finding a match, and there are approximately 160,000
                donors on the British Bone Marrow Donor Registry. We must take

                whether the functions which the Fire Authority, in this case,
                carries out are still required. The stage-two review evaluates
                performance, and whether that review is carried out depends on

                Area Hospital, on 30 September 2002, was 1,935. That represents
                a reduction of 100 in the six months from 31 March 2002. Over
                the same period, day cases rose by 140 from 2,269 to 2,409.
                There were 73 delayed discharges at 30&nbsp;September 2002, due
                to difficulties in meeting the demand for care in the community.
                In recognition of these pressures, I have made funding available
                for an additional 24-bed ward at the hospital, scheduled to be
                in place by March 2004. The trust is also working with the
                Northern Health and Social Services Board and my Department to
                find further ways to reduce waiting lists, particularly for day
                procedures, day care and through the creation of additional

                acute shortage of community care provision in the Homefirst
                Community Trust area and that a contributory factor to the lack
                of community care is that patients in Northern Ireland receive
                some of the lowest levels of funding per patient in the Health

                patients are being admitted on an emergency basis because they
                are not being adequately treated in the community? For example,
                east Antrim has some of the longest occupational therapy waiting
                lists. Will she explain why the consultant rheumatologist for
                the Northern Health and Social Services Board area had to close
                her list in March 2000? Furthermore, would she care to comment
                on the rumour that the Massereene ambulance depot is being
                considered for relocation and on the effects that that would
                have on jobs and the delivery of care in the community?</p>

                care in the community. However, if the Member wishes to write to
                me on the subject, I would be happy to take up that point with

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On several occasions I have stated that years
                of underfunding have affected not only hospital capacity but,
                vitally, care in the community to the extent that it impacts on
                people who are admitted inappropriately to hospital and on
                people who are ready to go home but whose discharges are delayed
                because they are not able to go home. It also has an impact on
                those waiting for services in the community. That is why I
                secured an additional £19·1 million for the current financial
                year, which will increase the capacity of health and social
                services boards to make payments to care homes, to implement the
                changes that I have already outlined in nursing care, and to
                support an additional 1,000 people in community settings. I
                continue to seek extra funding to increase that number even
                further. I continue to prioritise delayed discharge. I assure
                the Member of that and of the restoration of domiciliary care as
                a cost-effective alternative to institutional care.</p>

                capacity, equipment, staff or staff training. Therefore, one of
                my major achievements has been to highlight and document that in
                workforce planning and to seek, and to some extent gain, the
                funding to put that in place. With regard to the scarcity of
                community care packages, people will see that, since I took on
                this portfolio, there has been a shift towards community care
                and more money invested in community care than there had been

                the deficit of staff in almost every sector; and the total lack

                series of questions that, like the heckling today, has more to
                do with current selection conventions in the Unionist community
                to choose candidates for forthcoming elections than with

                to the previous question is only a small part of all the work
                that has been done. We have been working towards a ban on
                tobacco advertising. There have been public information
                campaigns, and considerable work has been done on the key target
                groups. We have also been working to get the public health
                messages out, and we have been working particularly hard to
                ensure that the public are personally engaged in this, so that
                all aspects of one of the greatest causes of disease in our
                population are tackled and fought. That is alongside the wider
                social and economic determinants of health, which I am delighted
                that we have been able to address in our ‘Investing for Health’
                strategy.</p>

                Nearly 2,700 applications have been received, and many grant

                community and voluntary sectors about funding allocations and
                applications being assessed in time. I have directed that work
                being introduced on several fronts should address those
                concerns. Discussions have taken place in the Administration and
                with the implementing bodies for the programme. I regret to say
                that following today’s Question Time one of my last official
                duties will be to meet with representatives of intermediary
                funding bodies to hear their concerns and to tell them how these
                are being addressed, so that we can identify and remove
                obstacles to the more rapid allocation of money to projects and
                groups that have applied for funding.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There will be a review of the application
                form that has caused some concern and a review of processes to

                discussions with the European Commission to identify ways of
                simplifying the application of its regulations, and there will
                be a review of the scope of activities that can be funded from
                measures in the programme in consultation with the monitoring
                committee. At a meeting of the North/South Ministerial Council
                in Ballycastle last Wednesday, my counterpart from the Dublin
                Government, Tom Parlon, Minister of State at the Department of
                Finance, and I had a report from the chief executive officer of
                the Special EU Programmes Body on some of those issues. As I
                have already said, I will be taking forward some of those

                submitted for answer later. He would not expect me to have,
                either at my fingertips or in my head, the kind of details that
                he seeks on constituency allocations. Allocations are not made
                on a constituency basis; preference is given according to
                measures within the different priorities. In my response to Mr
                Byrne’s question, I said that more than 2,700 applications
                have been received from organisations and from community and
                voluntary groups throughout Northern Ireland. Although not all
                have been successful, many have been, and the assessment process
                is ongoing. Details are available regularly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Special EU Programmes Body has been
                submitting monitoring reports to the Department of Finance and
                Personnel and will continue to do so. I am in a position to make
                those reports available to my Executive Colleagues, so that we
                can see where money is being allocated. As the Member will
                appreciate, meeting social need is an important requirement.
                Identifying areas of social need is one of the horizontal
                principles that must be borne in mind when determining
                allocations. In particular, allocations made under the local
                strategy partnerships, which are responsible for two of the
                measures in priority 3, have directly taken account of relative
                need in all 26 district councils.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I listened carefully to the Minister’s
                answer and welcome the fact that Peace II funding has begun. I
                also welcome the possibility of simplifying the complex
                application forms for Peace II funding. Can the Minister
                explain, in the light of the community’s great concern, the
                delay in delivering that funding? Why have we had to wait until
                now? I and many other Members understood that the funding would
                be on stream long before now.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I share the Minister’s concern that he is
                carrying out his final duties today. However, he must remember
                that if his party had joined with the rest of us, 82% of this
                place would not be disenfranchised by the 18% sitting on the

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall respond to the first part of the
                Member’s question, for which, as Minister of Finance and
                Personnel, I am directly responsible. Although there have been
                some delays, allocations have been made since May 2002. There
                have been some considerable delays in the establishment of some
                of our local strategy partnerships and the development of their
                local strategy plans. Further delays were the result of the long
                and detailed consideration that must be given to applications.
                There is an understandable concern that applications are
                assessed fully, according to the criteria.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The criteria for Peace II funding are
                different in several respects from those applicable to Peace I
                funding. The particular emphasis on the
                &quot;distinctiveness&quot; criterion has caused some problems.
                The Special EU Programmes Body and the intermediary funding
                bodies are anxious to address the problems and to help groups
                articulate their aims and objectives as effectively as possible
                with respect to all the criteria. It is hoped that those groups
                do not find themselves in a situation in which their
                applications are returned for further clarification and
                elaboration. That has already happened and has therefore
                contributed to some of the delay. However, there is a
                significant momentum behind the Peace II programme, and I am
                confident that we can deliver on the spending objectives — not
                only in the immediate future but throughout the period for which
                the programme will operate.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The draft Budget presented to the Assembly on
                24 September is predicated on the use of the reinvestment and
                reform initiative and on the use of public-private partnerships
                to address infrastructure deficits. Beyond the immediate
                borrowing facility of £125 million for 2003-04, details of
                which have already been announced, the extent to which we can
                borrow is limited by our ability to raise additional revenue to
                service the debt. Any decisions will be taken with due regard to
                the recent consultation exercise on the review of rating policy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I have previously made clear, there will
                be no increase in regional rate beyond the pattern of recent
                years unless and until a fairer system is in place. In the
                meantime, I have proposed to the Executive a package of
                allocations from the September monitoring round for 2002-03
                amounting to £144 million and, in conjunction with the First
                Minister and the Deputy First Minister, a further package of
                £19 million this year and £47 million in 2003-04 from two of
                the Executive programme funds. As it will not be possible to
                announce these in the usual way — by a statement to the
                Assembly after Executive agreement — I have made details of
                the proposals available to Members through a press release.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for his answer and for
                his good news on a day when there is not a lot to be happy
                about. Will the Minister assure the House that, before he goes
                home tonight, he will have written all the cheques he is
                entitled to in favour of the socially disadvantaged groups? In
                doing so, will he remember to take account of potential
                efficiency savings as well as the sale of Government-held assets
                in constructing his Budget proposals? We do not want to leave
                anything untouched.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I must be careful when responding to the
                Chairperson of the Audit Committee and member of the Public
                Accounts Committee in this regard. Both of us will cease to hold
                our respective offices from midnight this evening, but when
                Members read the press releases on September monitoring and
                further allocations from two of the Executive programme funds,
                they will see that the Executive have done all in their power to
                redirect and add to the scope for investment in such vital
                services as health, education, roads infrastructure, transport
                facilities and the Water Service. It is a legacy of which we can
                be proud.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The responsibility for the actual spend will
                not be with the Minister of Finance and Personnel but with the
                Ministers who have responsibility for the various Departments.
                My Budget proposals contained a clear invitation and a
                requirement on all Departments to submit a report by the end of
                October on how they will address efficiency and asset management
                issues — and I trust that the present hiatus will not be a
                cause for any delay in that regard. When the Assembly returns
                — as I hope it will in the not too distant future — it is
                hoped that Members will find that considerable progress has been
                made with respect to what was proposed in the reforming and, as

                will take questions 3 and 12 together. A census key statistics
                release will be published as a printed report at the end of
                December 2002. That will provide basic counts on each census
                question at Northern Ireland and district council levels. It
                will include, among other things, information on religion,
                employment and general health. Similar statistics for ward and
                sub-ward output areas, of which there are approximately 5,000,
                will be made available on compact disc and on the census web
                site. Standard area statistics that provide detailed
                cross-tabulations required by census users are planned for the
                first half of next year. They will comprise a printed report at
                Northern Ireland level with 900,000 further cross-tabulations at
                local authority ward and sub-ward output area level. The report
                will be available on compact disc, on high-capacity digital
                versatile disc and on the census web site.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A census output prospectus, which details the

                Ireland Statistics and Research Agency web site, and that will
                be updated as necessary. The Department of Finance and Personnel
                plans to release census outputs in accordance with a timescale
                set out at the beginning of the process.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank all those who participated in, and
                worked on, the 2001 census: the public who took the time to
                complete and return the forms; the 3,000-strong field force of
                enumerators and supervisory staff who worked to deliver and,
                where necessary, collect the forms; and the census office staff
                who undertook the processing and reporting of the forms. It was
                a major exercise, and considerable value will be drawn from it
                for the future planning of services for which the Department is
                responsible.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first set of census results was published
                a few weeks ago. The details related to the gender breakdown
                across Northern Ireland at district council and ward levels.
                They were released in accordance with the timetable set out at
                the beginning of the census process, and in parallel with the
                release of similar information in England, Scotland and Wales.
                There has been no undue delay in the release of data, but an
                exercise of the scale of a census requires a considerable period
                of processing and a timetable for the release of the various
                parts of the data that have been collected. The next tranche of
                data will be released towards the end of the year, and it will

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All implementation bodies are aware of that

                the pattern of spend in the different priority areas. The

                in spending the money? There is concern that money was
                misallocated the last time, so it is imperative that proper
                control measures are put in place to ensure that money is not
                squandered. Nevertheless, the Departments must create the
                impetus to ensure that the money is properly spent and does not
                go back to Europe, because Northern Ireland badly needs it.</p>

                review the appropriateness, or otherwise, of the application

                Notwithstanding that, I am aware that there are concerns, and

                informally at the end of June this year that a potential problem
                had emerged with the Springvale outline business case that
                concerned initial affordability by the institutions rather than
                the long-term sustainability of the project. The Minister for

                consultation period. The Executive’s intention has been to
                engage fully with the Assembly and other groups on the content
                of the draft Budget and the draft Programme for Government,
                which it supports. We will do that in an integrated way,
                consulting on those documents together. Both documents have been
                made widely available to social partners, business, trade unions
                and the voluntary and community sector. In addition, a series of
                workshops and seminars has been arranged to enable as many

                incorporated into a revised Budget to be presented, if we were
                here, in early December, and, miracle of miracles, we might be.
                A detailed timetable for the presentation of our revised Budget
                is contained in the draft Budget document. I trust that the
                Ministers who will take over responsibility for our respective
                Departments will take note of the level of agreement reached on
                the proposals in the draft Budget, and I have a high degree of
                expectation that we can await the implementation of the Budget

                will be mindful of the urgency with which the issue must be
                addressed so that we can have a fair and equitable system for
                all.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On 2 July 2002, the McAuley Building was
                opened at the Mater Hospital. It is a new, state-of-the-art
                building that will service the hospital. It was called after
                Mother Catherine McAuley, a Catholic religious sister in the
                nineteenth century who founded the Sisters of Mercy, an order
                particularly dedicated to teaching and nursing. She was a sort
                of nineteenth-century Mother Teresa in Ireland. She and her
                sisters founded many schools, hospitals and other institutions
                the length and breadth of Ireland for the Irish people —
                Catholic and Protestant, from north and south. In many ways,
                together with other religious orders and people, both Catholic
                and Protestant, she established the foundations and
                infrastructure for schools, the education system and the health
                service in Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Part of those foundations was the Mater
                Hospital, which was founded in Belfast in 1883. By 1909, the
                hospital’s status in Ireland was such that it was recognised
                as a university teaching hospital. The Mater maternity unit was
                eventually opened in 1945, adding a further service to the
                hospital. In 1972, the hospital, which had previously been under
                Catholic control and which had been independent throughout its
                history, became part of the National Health Service. A deed of
                arrangement underpinned the transfer of the hospital to the NHS.
                That was a guarantee from the Government of the time that the
                hospital’s character and ethos would continue. I shall say
                more about that later.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Until 1972, the hospital was funded by the
                Young Philanthropists, of which my late father was a member. It
                was an imaginative and far-sighted group, for it saw that it was
                important to put moneys necessary for the hospital’s future
                into trust funds. Indeed, the group raised a great deal of
                money. Over the years, thanks to the financial wizardry of a
                very distinguished cleric called Monsignor Mullally, the money
                was transformed into a multimillion-pound fund. The upshot was
                that the McAuley Building was opened in July 2002. Built at the
                cost of £17 million, it was virtually a new hospital. None of
                that money came from the state. It was raised by generations of
                Belfast people. It was used to build and equip the building. It
                was, in effect, a gift of £17 million to the public Health
                Service by a private charitable trust.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Mater Hospital has, however, been
                informed, following the Department’s document ‘Developing
                Better Services: Modernising Hospitals and Reforming Structures’,
                which was published in June 2002, that it is to be downgraded to
                a local hospital. It will no longer be an acute hospital. In
                substance, that means that its acute services will be
                systematically removed over several years. It will end up as
                little more than a glorified nursing home.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Despite what the Department says, the
                hospital will lose many of its services. It will lose its
                accident and emergency service, which — as those who live in
                north Belfast know — is crucial to the people of the area.
                That area has the lowest car ownership in Belfast — indeed, in
                Northern Ireland — yet the Department is persisting in its
                views. The Department also insists that intensive care and high
                dependency units will be removed. Inpatient general medicine,
                inpatient cardiology and the coronary care unit, inpatient
                diabetic services, inpatient respiratory medicine, inpatient
                general surgery, inpatient urology services, inpatient cardiac
                investigation, inpatient gynaecology, inpatient laboratory
                services and inpatient anaesthetic services will also go. I
                contend that there will be nothing left if the Department’s
                proposals are implemented.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The developing better services document takes
                the form of a White Paper. It not called a White Paper, but that
                is what it is. It represents the Department’s and the Minister’s
                thinking. In fact, the Minister had to be pushed into extending
                the period of consultation. She said that consultation should
                end in September 2002. That has now been extended to the end of
                October 2002. That demonstrates the Department’s commitment to
                the proposals contained in the document. There is no doubt that
                if the proposals are implemented, it will be the end of the
                Mater Hospital as an acute service hospital in Belfast.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Furthermore, the continuance of maternity
                services is also under threat. That threat is not as explicit as
                the threat to other services. The survival of the service is
                conditional upon the Mater Hospital’s working with the new
                centralised Belfast Maternity Service. That is code for &quot;If
                you do not do what you are told, you will lose your maternity
                services&quot;. That is what the Minister and the Department are
                saying to the Mater Hospital.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department says that the Mater Hospital’s
                teaching status will remain. I mentioned that such was the
                status of the Mater Hospital at the beginning of the century
                that it was granted university teaching status. The Department
                says that that status will remain. How credible is that
                proposal, when the Minister is taking away the acute services
                that would encourage doctors and nurses to come to the Mater
                Hospital to train? Its teaching status might remain in name, but
                in reality it will not remain at all. It does not take a genius
                or a medical expert to reach that conclusion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department says that the developing
                better services document is in line with the Hayes Report —
                the acute hospitals review group report. That is untrue. I ask
                Members to check the document and the Hayes Report. It is not in
                line with the proposal for partnership with the Whiteabbey
                Hospital to deliver acute services to north Belfast,
                Carrickfergus and Newtownabbey. It is not true for the
                Department to assert that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no proposal to retain acute services
                at the Mater for the foreseeable future. Some of the acute
                services that I mentioned will be retained for a few years, but
                they will be phased out. However, the Hayes Report stated that
                acute services at the Mater would be retained for the
                foreseeable future — in other words, for an indefinite period.
                The Minister’s document does not say that; it says that it is
                merely a transitional arrangement. Further to that, the Hayes
                Report states that a regional service should be located in the
                Mater, but that is not mentioned in the Minister’s document at
                all.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The effect in north Belfast will be
                considerable and significant. The effect on employment alone
                will be substantial. Around 1,000 people are employed by the
                Mater Hospital. It is possibly one of the biggest employers in
                north Belfast. Ancillary, clerical, medical, clinical and
                nursing staff will be systematically removed. In a few years’
                time, the number of employees might be down to 500 or 600 staff
                — and still falling. Think of the effect that that will have
                on north Belfast.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The latest analysis of north Belfast
                contained in the North Belfast Community Action Project Report
                states:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The population served by the North and
                West Belfast Health &amp; Social Services Trust has some of the
                poorest health and social care indices with high incidences of
                cancer, asthma, bronchitis and other diseases. Seventeen out of
                the 20 wards in North Belfast are in the 25% most health
                deprived wards in Northern Ireland. Ten out of 20 wards in the
                area are in the 25% of wards in Northern Ireland with the
                highest ratios for cancer. These are all causally linked to the
                levels of deprivation experienced by this population.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Acute hospital services will be removed from
                the people who most need them. What sort of madness is this
                coming from the Department of Health? North Belfast has some of
                the highest rates of suicide, substance abuse and mental ill
                health. How can any of these proposals ameliorate that
                situation?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Mater Hospital serves the community, and
                has served it very well. Over 45,000 people have used the
                accident and emergency service in the Mater Hospital over the
                past year. There were 6,000 medical or surgical emergencies and
                1,000 births. That is a more than creditable performance for any
                Northern Ireland hospital.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister’s proposals are unacceptable
                and wrong. They are dangerous and will hurt the long-suffering
                people of north Belfast. They are an offence to good public
                policy. Is it not ironic that a Minister who is ostensibly
                committed to the equality agenda is, through her proposals,
                undermining that agenda and disadvantaging the people of north
                Belfast, Catholic and Protestant?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proposals also run contrary to the deed
                of arrangement, because they undermine the historic character
                and ethos of the hospital. Not only are the proposals legally
                questionable, they are undoubtedly politically unacceptable and
                objectionable to the people of north Belfast. During this little
                political interlude, let us hope that the Minister will have a
                change of mind, or that her mind will be changed, by the time we
                return.</p>

                Committee but as MLA for West Belfast and as one who has spent
                many years in west and north Belfast — I sometimes say how
                many years, but I will decline to do so now. I have long
                experience of the Mater Hospital, the Royal Victoria Hospital
                and the City Hospital.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Alban Maginness has already mentioned the new
                £17 million development at the Mater Hospital. Every hospital
                has its origins, and people become attached to them. The Mater
                is in many ways unique, but I will not dwell on that point
                because it has already been well covered. It seems odd that it
                has been proposed that the Mater Hospital, with its new £17
                million development, is to be stripped of its acute status.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Alban Maginness rightly says that ‘Developing
                Better Services: Modernising Hospitals and Reforming Structures’
                is in effect a White Paper. When asked, the permanent secretary
                made it clear that it was a White Paper. The odds of the
                proposals contained in a White Paper being put into effect are
                at least 50 to one on. Consultation will still take place, and
                perhaps in special circumstances changes will be made, but as
                Members will know, generally speaking, the recommendations
                contained in a White Paper will be carried out. The part of the
                document that deals with organisation does not have &quot;White
                Paper status&quot;, because it is part of the review of local
                services.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is proposed in the document that the Mater
                Hospital become a local hospital and a key institution in the
                fields of medical and nurse training and that its links with
                Queen’s University be put on a statutory basis to formalise
                its role as a teaching hospital. I was taught in the Mater
                Hospital and also in the Royal. The teaching role of the Mater
                Hospital is well known in this country and far beyond. No
                formality or legal standing is needed in that regard. It is an
                outstanding teaching hospital. I find the suggestion that
                somebody from Queen’s University should be on the hospital’s
                board of management condescending. It is as if the hospital is
                being given some sort of important status when, in fact, it is
                being slowly destroyed by the removal of its acute services.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Mater Hospital has been outstanding in
                its diagnosis and treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary
                disease (COPD), which is associated with emphysema, smoking and
                dust in the air. North Belfast has twice as many cases of that
                terrible condition as other parts of Northern Ireland. It seems
                odd that, although the Mater Hospital is so well established and
                recognised for its treatment of chest disease, it may lose its
                acute services over the next 10 years. The hospital has piloted
                a multidisciplinary approach to treating patients with COPD, and
                it is the only hospital in the North with a specialist COPD
                clinic. Only two years ago, a young nurse there was named UK
                Respiratory Nurse of the Year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The McAuley Building houses facilities to
                provide the most advanced acute services for the benefit not
                only of its catchment area, but of a much wider community
                through regional and outreach services and clinics.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I speak not only from my own years of
                experience, but as someone who has visited the accident and
                emergency (A&amp;E) departments in all the major hospitals,
                including the Mater Hospital. Let me take those of the Royal
                Victoria Hospital and Belfast City Hospital as examples. I have
                nothing but respect for the nurses, doctors and other staff who
                work there, but they cannot cope, and not only in winter. I
                shall not go into the whole matter of trolleys and people
                waiting, but acute services, especially A&amp;E, are not coping.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I emphasise that the picture is the same in
                Belfast City Hospital and in Antrim Area Hospital. I have
                visited all those hospitals. I suppose that no matter what
                Maurice Hayes and his people said about hospitals, they could
                not possibly satisfy everyone. However, with regard to overall
                principles, I have no difficulty in accepting the Hayes Report,
                and I am aware of what it said about the Mater Hospital.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I understand that every politician will make
                a case for the hospital in his or her area. However, in respect
                of the Minister’s points, there is something about the Mater
                Hospital that is not fully realised. The Antrim Area Hospital
                and the Royal Victoria Hospital could not cope with north
                Belfast. It has nothing to do with sentiment, although that is
                involved in all hospitals. It comes down to the direct clinical
                issues that affect north Belfast, which Members will accept is
                the most impoverished area in these islands. To remove acute
                services — even in a few years’ time — is the beginning of
                the end of that hospital. It must be borne in mind that the
                other hospitals cannot cope.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I appreciate and understand that it was not
                easy for the Minister to make the decisions in her White Paper.
                Were someone to ask me what I recommended, I should not find it
                easy, taking account of the picture across Northern Ireland.
                However, the sums have either been done incorrectly or wrongly
                interpreted. I should like the Minister and her Department to
                examine those figures again. They must realise that the people
                of north Belfast — Catholic and Protestant alike — could not
                cope without the Mater Hospital. Its proud tradition extends to
                the Shankill Road, the Antrim Road, Glengormley and the
                ever-increasing population of Newtownabbey and beyond. As I said
                earlier, Antrim Area Hospital could not cope either.</p>

                allow others to make a contribution.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Alban Maginness for raising this
                matter. He has very ably set out the case that must be made for
                the retention of services at the Mater Hospital. Most Members
                should be able to agree with that, and I concur with many of the
                remarks made by the Chairperson of the Health Committee, Dr Joe
                Hendron. He knows from his personal, professional experience how
                the Mater Hospital has met the needs of the people of north and
                west Belfast.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I remember that, a few years ago, a public
                meeting was called in Newtownabbey in relation to the proposals
                that had been announced for the Whiteabbey Hospital. Hundreds of
                people attended, including trade unionists, staff, doctors,
                people in the medical profession, people whose relatives had
                been treated at Whiteabbey Hospital and members of the public.
                The common cry at that meeting was that if, at some stage, as
                part of a devolved Government, there was a Minister from
                Northern Ireland, no locally based Minister could possibly take
                such a decision. Unfortunately, as a result of the Department of
                Health, Social Services and Public Safety’s ‘Developing
                Better Services: Modernising Hospitals and Reforming Structures’
                document, we are now faced with proposals that not only confirm
                the bad news about Whiteabbey Hospital, but deliver a bolt out
                of the blue for the Mater Hospital.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As was rightly stated by Mr Maginness and Dr
                Hendron, Dr Hayes did not suggest the sweeping, radical
                downgrading of the Mater Hospital that the Minister of Health,
                Social Services and Public Safety has proposed. That must be
                emphasised, and, as demonstrated at a recent meeting of Belfast
                City Council, any attempt to pin the blame on the Hayes Report
                must be stopped.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proposals are resisted and opposed across
                the community in north and west Belfast. I met recently with
                Lady McCollum and Patricia Gordon, community workers and medical
                staff. I visited the Mater Hospital and toured the McAuley
                Building. There is unanimous dismay and bewilderment at the
                decision to implement the proposals now, especially, as other
                Members stated, given that £17 million of investment was
                privately raised — with not a penny of that coming from the
                public purse. The suggestion is that the Mater Hospital should
                be downgraded to the same status as a local hospital.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Aside from the impact that that will have on
                the delivery of medical services in the most deprived and needy
                area of our Province, we must remember that the Mater Hospital,
                which serves both communities, is perhaps the biggest employer
                in the area. It is situated in Crumlin, which is the most
                deprived ward in Northern Ireland. When I toured the hospital, I
                was struck by the number of people from both sides of the
                community divide who work in it and who receive treatment in it.
                Both sets of people, regardless of their background, are
                devastated that the Mater Hospital is to be downgraded from its
                current status to nothing more than a local hospital.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has been argued that some provision, such
                as maternity services, will be retained. However, if specialists
                such as anaesthetists are not retained, the long-term outlook
                for maternity services is poor, because it would not provide
                value for money to pay for those services simply to cover
                maternity provision. That the Mater Hospital could be retained
                as a major teaching hospital without the throughput of
                specialised services is not tenable and will not happen in
                practice.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister is delivering a death knell to
                the Mater Hospital, unless she changes her mind; is forced to
                change her mind; or her successor reverses the disastrous course
                along which she seeks to set the hospital.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At a recent meeting of Belfast City Council,
                the political parties unanimously supported the retention of the
                Mater Hospital’s status. There is unanimous support in the
                communities, and it is to be hoped that there is unanimous
                support among political representatives. I appeal to the
                Department and to those civil servants who will guide and advise
                the person who succeeds the current Minister.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Perhaps the Minister and her party have
                decided that this attack on a vital service in the most needy
                community — north Belfast — will go ahead. However, I hope
                that the new Minister will be advised that the House has united
                in opposition to the proposal and that the clear message will go
                out that there should be no interference with, and no
                downgrading of, the services that the Mater Hospital provides.
                If anything, we should recognise the valuable contribution that
                the hospital has made over many years, and we should work to
                retain and strengthen it.</p>

                Structures’, issues such as the Mater Hospital must be sorted

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am very concerned about the proposal to
                remove accident and emergency (A&amp;E) services from the
                hospital, bearing in mind what that would mean for the provision
                of acute services, particularly A&amp;E services themselves. My
                worries about the removal of full casualty services from the
                Mater Hospital are not merely a matter of defending a facility
                in my constituency — although you may note, Mr Deputy Speaker,
                that all the Members from North Belfast agree on a lot of what
                is being said today, simply because of the hospital’s
                location.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, as one of the most deprived areas of
                Ireland, North Belfast relies greatly on the Mater Hospital,
                which contributes to the health of the population. Mr Alban
                Maginness mentioned the number of patients who are treated, but
                he did so in a different context than I. There is no
                justification for the closure of the Mater Hospital’s A&amp;E
                department. According to the figures that the Department of
                Health, Social Services and Public Safety published last month,
                the Mater Hospital’s A&amp;E department treats over 10,000
                more patients each year than Daisy Hill Hospital and over 20,000
                more than either the Causeway Hospital or the Downe Hospital,
                yet all those hospitals are earmarked for A&amp;E services while
                the Mater Hospital is not.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I fully accept that A&amp;E units require a
                certain throughput to maintain effectiveness and efficiency, but
                I cannot see any justification for failing the Mater on those
                grounds. Indeed, although we are all aware of the debates about
                the site of the acute hospital west of the Bann, the Mater’s
                A&amp;E department treats more people than the Enniskillen and
                Omagh hospitals together. Even in Belfast, the Mater’s A&amp;E
                department treats over 90% of the volume of patients who are
                treated at the City Hospital’s A&amp;E department, and
                apparently treats them more efficiently.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have two hospitals in the same city that
                treat roughly the same volume of people every year. One of those
                hospitals is located within a few hundred metres of the main
                trauma unit in the Six Counties, while the other is in another
                part of the city. What justification is there for favouring the
                hospital that is so close to the Royal Victoria Hospital?
                Considering the differences in the performances of those two
                units, the argument in favour of maintaining the Mater’s
                A&amp;E department as part of the provision of casualty services
                in Belfast becomes stronger.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In developing better services, it is conceded
                that the proposed change in the role of the Mater Hospital will
                take some considerable time: it will be at least 10 years before
                anything is done with casualty provision there. A week in
                politics is a long time, and a decade is simply beyond
                reasonable foresight. How can anyone tell with any accuracy what
                the healthcare needs of the people of Belfast and, in particular
                those of north Belfast, will be in 2013?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That being so, is there any rationale for
                making decisions now about what should happen so far in the
                future? I urge the Department of Health, Social Services and
                Public Safety to take that on board and guarantee to maintain
                the Mater Hospital indefinitely. That is not to say that with
                the properly funded development of reasonable trauma services in
                Belfast, there may not be a need in future to review the Mater’s
                A&amp;E department, but we can have that debate when it comes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other Members have given reasons for
                maintaining and assisting the Mater. There have been 30 years of
                conflict, and north Belfast has seen a disproportionate amount
                of death, injury, imprisonment and militarisation. Its condition
                today is a consequence of decades of statutory neglect, and Mr
                Alban Maginness said that the amount of money that the North and
                West Belfast Health and Social Services Trust, as opposed to the
                Executive, gives to the area speaks volumes. The Mater Hospital
                is an important local employer, and removing the A&amp;E
                department will have a detrimental effect on the cohesion and
                morale of the hospital staff as a whole.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The staff of the Mater Hospital, whom I have
                also met, and the unions both fear that the removal of the
                A&amp;E department will in turn undermine the hospital as a
                whole, compromising job security and the ability to attract
                doctors, nurses, and so forth. Some of the reductions in health
                services make no sense when political representatives from all
                parties are arguing for more resources in north Belfast for
                education, youth provision, job creation, leisure provision, and
                so forth. Go raibh maith agat.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other Members have covered many of the
                issues. However, the only way the problems of health and acute
                hospitals will be solved is through the restructuring of the
                Health Service. When that time arrives we will have to consider
                the Mater Hospital’s position.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are two issues involved. First, someone
                gave the Mater Hospital permission to build the fabulous McAuley
                Building, because it was felt that more beds were needed. Why
                did that happen? The money did not come from the Government; the
                community raised it, and it could have been better spent
                elsewhere. Everyone knows that in north Belfast health issues
                such as mental health and the levels of suicide have been
                neglected. Unfortunately, the Government gave the Mater Hospital
                that permission and, in many ways, gave it a vision for the
                future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second issue relates to the
                contradictions in the acute hospitals review group report with
                regard to what is being said now. Those contradictions have been
                well rehearsed. There was a proposal for the partnership of the
                Mater Hospital with the Whiteabbey Hospital for the provision of
                services for north Belfast, Newtownabbey and Carrickfergus.
                Where has that proposal gone? It was included in the
                recommendations of the review group. We were also told that a
                regional service would be provided at the Mater Hospital. That
                has now gone.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to hear from the Minister why
                permission was given to build the McAuley Building when the
                situation was to change. Also, why are there contradictions
                between the two reports?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a former medical registrar at the Mater
                Infirmorum Hospital, I add my support to the retention of this
                great and unique hospital. Following a visit to Lourdes, I wrote
                my second book, ‘Bangor: Light of the World’, which told how
                Bangor became the focus of a religious life of great depth and
                power in the early medieval period of Europe. With the fall of
                the Roman Empire, Irish and British monks were left to salvage
                what was left of Christian civilisation and share in its
                traditions the secrets of wisdom, justice and mercy for all
                mankind. That is what the Mater Hospital means to me.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are many who believe that we have
                reached a stage of nothingness and have invented the philosophy
                of the void. The wisdom that makes the Mater Hospital what it is
                is not irrelevant today, especially in our present
                circumstances. It is not just an embodiment of what is or even
                what will be; it is a temple built with living stones, with
                doctors, nurses and auxiliaries from both the active and
                contemplative life from both religious traditions, dedicated to
                the rights and duties of the person, imbued with a sense of
                honour, justice, mercy and self-sacrifice and of holy hope and
                high humility. Their patients are from the Shankill and the New
                Lodge roads. They are all asking, as one, for entry to their own
                sanctuary. They are the secret suffering poor of north Belfast,
                but they are all pilgrims on the road to paradise.</p>

                services are taken away from a hospital, its position is
                destroyed, and it ceases to be a real hospital. I am glad to see
                that Dr Hendron agrees with that. It is a fact.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If ever the Mater Hospital was needed as an
                acute services hospital, it is today; there is a crying need for
                its services. It is located in an area of dense housing and
                intense poverty. If there was ever a time when we should
                maintain the hospital, it is now. What grieves me is that, while
                many hospitals such as the Mater Hospital have been supported
                and maintained by the voluntary contributions of charitable
                groups, the Department has stolen the money that those charities
                gave.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In my area, we helped to lead actions to
                raise large sums of money for a special heart treatment service
                in Ballymena Hospital. The Department stole that money and took
                it away to Antrim. No harm to the people of Antrim — including
                the Deputy Speaker — but they did not raise that money. It was
                raised for my area, and those benefits should have remained in
                that area. As was rightly said by one Member, planners tell
                people to give their money to ensure that hospital extensions
                are possible, but at the end of the day, the benefit may be
                taken away from them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to end on a good note. Although I
                would not cross every &quot;t&quot; and dot every &quot;i&quot;
                of what Dr Adamson said, he is my friend. He used to give me
                jags, and every time I left for a Third-World country, he came
                to my home and jagged me with great relish, as an Official
                Unionist would want to jag Democratic Unionist flesh, but I
                never held that against him.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The hospital that has done this work; the
                people who backed the hospital with their gifts and all its
                workers from both sides of the community deserve to be
                supported. I trust that, if it is the last thing that this
                Assembly does, it will save the Mater Hospital from being
                demoralised and reduced to being a glorified nursing home. The
                Mater Hospital should be maintained as a thoroughgoing acute
                hospital, giving the people of that area all the services that
                they deserve and need.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Paisley, you have tremendous trust in your
                doctor. <i>[Laughter].</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir John Gorman:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will not take a moment. I just want to say
                that I have some experience of the Mater Hospital. My mother,
                who suffered acutely from a serious problem before the war, went
                there in an emergency and recovered. I had many friends in the
                RUC — now the PSNI — who were very happy to be taken there
                as a result of bombings and shootings, and so on, because they
                believed that they would receive the best of attention,
                irrespective of what the political slant might be.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It strikes me as particularly wrong that £17
                million collected by people years ago — which is probably
                worth about £80 million in today’s terms — should be now
                seen as simply a resource to be absorbed. The attitude seems to
                be: &quot;Never mind where it came from or what the motives were
                for collecting it&quot;. That is quite wrong. I beg the Minister
                in her last few hours to reconsider the matter to see whether
                some of the phrases used in Dr Hayes’s report in relation to
                the Mater Hospital might be given rather more favourable
                connotations. I do not doubt that, being the man he is, he was
                probably keen not to show favouritism to a hospital of which he
                was chairman for so many years.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.45 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Possibly, he was almost too fair. I ask the
                Minister to re-examine the issue to see if, at least, the Mater’s
                teaching and accident and emergency roles can be retained. It
                would be to the benefit of the entire country to see in the
                Chamber, where so many antipathetic remarks have been made among
                parties, unanimity from every party in order to save the Mater
                Hospital.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Aithním, áfach, gur ábhar imní do
                fhoireann an Mater agus do mhuintir thuaisceart Bhéal Feirste
                mo mholadh gur chóir go ndéanfaí ospidéal áitiúil
                nua-aimseartha den Mater, agus is maith liom an deis seo a
                bheith agam tabhairt faoin imní sin.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Proposals for the future of the Mater
                Hospital are set out in the consultation document ‘Developing
                Better Services: Modernising Hospitals and Reforming Structures’.
                The changes proposed were never planned to happen overnight. The
                Mater Hospital will continue as an acute hospital for the
                foreseeable future, providing a full range of acute services.
                The consultation will end on 31 October, and I stress that no
                decisions will be made on any of the proposals until there has
                been an opportunity to consider fully all the evidence and
                information available.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, I recognise that the proposal that
                the Mater Hospital should become a modern local hospital has
                caused concern, both to its staff and to the people of north
                Belfast. I welcome this opportunity to address their concerns.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My objective is to provide high-quality
                modern hospital services to the population here. It is clear
                that hospitals in future will need to collaborate as part of
                clinical networks. Proposals for the Mater Hospital are that it
                should become a modern local hospital with strong clinical links
                to the acute hospitals network, both at the Royal Group of
                Hospitals and Belfast City Hospital. I would expect the Mater,
                as a local hospital, to make full use of its modern facilities
                to provide increasingly sophisticated methods of investigation,
                diagnosis and day procedures.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to the recent £17 million
                investment and the tremendous work done by people in the
                community to bring that about, we must in future ensure that the
                investment in the Mater is used to its fullest in serving the
                population of the area. That must be given careful consideration
                before coming to any final decisions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Under these proposals, the Mater Hospital
                will also provide a base for a range of expert clinicians,
                specialist nurses and other health professionals, who will
                relate to the hospital needs of the population it serves, making
                a distinctive contribution to the overall provision of modern,
                high-quality services in the heart of the local community.
                Developing local hospitals in this way will require considerable
                and continuing investment in modern equipment and staff
                training.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have proposed that maternity services at
                the Mater Hospital should be retained, but the hospital has been
                experiencing increasing difficulties in maintaining those
                services. Therefore, I have proposed that it should exploit its
                close proximity to the new centralised maternity hospital on
                either the Royal Group of Hospitals or Belfast City Hospital
                site to open up new opportunities for supporting maternity
                services at the Mater Hospital on a close partnership basis. I
                expect that the new centralised maternity hospital and the Mater
                Hospital will develop those opportunities to the full.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also realise the concerns of the staff who
                live in north Belfast, where the Mater Hospital is a significant
                employer. They fear that their jobs might be lost in the
                hospital’s transformation to a modern local hospital. The
                Mater Hospital will continue to be a large and busy hospital,
                and it will continue to provide much-needed employment for the
                area.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is not possible to be specific about how
                staff might be affected at this stage, and detailed work will
                need to be undertaken with the health and personal social
                services organisations and other key interested parties to
                identify long-term staffing needs. During the consultation
                process, I was aware of the growing cross-party and
                cross-community support for retaining acute services at the
                Mater Hospital, as well as the strong lobby from the Mater
                Hospital Trust and staff at the hospital. I am sure that that
                will continue to be reflected in the responses to my
                consultation up until its close on 31 October, as it has been in
                Members’ contributions today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I assure Members that, as stated in the
                report ‘Developing Better Services: Modernising Hospitals and
                Reforming Structures’, the importance of making full use of
                the modern facilities at the Mater Hospital is fully accepted.
                The hospital has an excellent range of facilities, and in any
                future configuration of hospital services we must ensure that
                those facilities are used to their best advantage through
                clinical networking and building on new achievements in medical
                treatment and technology.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members raised points about the phasing out
                of services. Acute services will continue for the foreseeable
                future and will be reviewed according to levels of capacity and
                deprivation as those are assessed. There is no question of
                phasing out acute services over the years in the way that has
                been suggested. Any decisions will look at the needs assessed at
                a particular time and the overall capacity of the service to
                deliver those services to people in the area.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Teaching status will remain as part of a
                clinical network of acute and local hospitals, and opportunities
                for more rounded training for medical staff will be available.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Before coming to any decision on the chronic
                obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) clinic, we must look very
                carefully at the services provided in any area where such a
                disease is a feature of deprivation and associated ill health. A
                final decision has not been made, and the information referred
                to in this debate will be reflected in the responses to the
                consultation.</p>
