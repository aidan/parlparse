                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I propose to conduct proceedings in
                accordance with the decisions of the Business Committee, which
                has allocated four hours to the debate. As the next two motions
                relate to the exclusion of members of a political party from
                holding ministerial office, I propose to conduct one debate. I
                will ask Mr Trimble to move the motion, and I will then call Mr
                Adams to respond. Both those Members may speak for up to 30
                minutes. All the timings I am giving are maximum timings, not
                minimum or normative timings. The debate will then be open to
                Members, and each of those called may speak for up to 10
                minutes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the end of the debate, I will call on a
                Sinn Féin Member to respond and on Mr Trimble or his nominee to
                make a winding-up speech, each being allocated 15 minutes to do
                so. I will then put the Question on the first motion, and if the
                first motion is agreed, the second motion falls. If the first
                motion is negatived, I will call Dr Paisley to move the second
                motion formally, and, without debate, I will put the Question. I
                remind Members that the votes on those motions will be on a
                cross- community basis.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That in consequence of the failure of the
                Provisional IRA to offer up its illegal weaponry for
                destruction; the Republican Movement’s continuing terrorist
                threat, and active pursuit, of terrorist outrages to secure its
                aims; the maintenance by the IRA of an active terrorist
                organisation; the growing number of cases of IRA involvement in
                terrorist activity in Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland
                and across the globe; the fact that the Provisional IRA is
                inextricably linked to Sinn Féin; and the involvement and
                dominance of members of Sinn Féin in the decision-making
                &quot;Army Council&quot; of the Provisional IRA, this Assembly
                resolves that Sinn Féin does not enjoy its confidence because
                it is not committed to non-violence and exclusively peaceful
                means and further, in accordance with Section 30 of the Northern
                Ireland Act 1998, determines that members of Sinn Féin shall be
                excluded from holding office as Ministers for a period of 12
                months from the date of this resolution. <i>— [Rev Dr Ian
                Paisley]</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Trimble:</p>
                </font></b><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, I will explain what the consequences
                of the motion will be. I expect that later today the motion will
                be endorsed by a majority of Members. If it fails to receive the
                requisite cross-community support, it will have no effect.
                However, if it does receive that support, the motion will effect
                the removal of Sinn Féin Ministers from office. I wish to make
                that clear from the outset. The draft of the motion sticks to
                the terms of the Northern Ireland Act 1998. A motion passed on
                those terms will exclude that party’s representatives from
                office. We decided that there was no point in having any surplus
                verbiage. If the motion does not receive the requisite
                cross-community support, my party and I shall act. First, we
                shall withdraw; secondly, the Ulster Unionist Ministers will
                resign. We will follow that procedure with the objective of
                bringing about the complete and indefinite suspension of the
                Assembly. I hope that that will be achieved in a week or two.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our withdrawal will mean that we shall not
                participate in Executive business, which means that the
                Executive will not meet. The purpose of the interval is to
                enable Ministers to tidy their desk and arrange an orderly
                transfer of responsibility to those who succeed them. At the
                beginning of next week, I shall announce the precise
                arrangements for resignation. I say that to make our position
                clear.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to express my appreciation to the
                Progressive Unionist Party for its support of the motion. Some
                people have expressed surprise that we have accepted that
                support, but we are glad of it. As I stated at the first sitting
                of the Assembly, we have always taken the position that the fact
                that people have a past does not mean that they cannot have a
                future. We knew that when we embarked on the process, which we
                hoped would be transitional. I have no doubt about the PUP’s
                commitment to exclusively peaceful and democratic means.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the Speaker said, the DUP motion will be
                moved should the Ulster Unionist Party motion fail to achieve
                the requisite cross-community support. We shall support that
                motion, as it will have the same effect as our motion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have tabled the motion because, in the
                past three and a half years — indeed in the 17 months that we
                have been in office — the Republican movement has failed to
                demonstrate that it is committed to exclusively peaceful and
                democratic means. We embarked upon the process in the belief
                that it would be a process of transition, giving an opportunity
                to those who have been involved in paramilitarism to leave
                violence behind, move into the democratic process and commit
                themselves to exclusively peaceful and democratic means. That
                opportunity existed. We have been patient, but it is now more
                than seven years since the Downing Street declaration first put
                that to the test. It has been more than three and a half years
                since the agreement was made, and we have had periods of office
                that amount to 20 months. There has been ample opportunity for
                transition. We have been extremely patient, but we have not seen
                any evidence.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The key element that has been used as a
                litmus test of commitment to exclusively peaceful and democratic
                means is the decommissioning of weapons and other materiel.
                Decommissioning has always been important, and other parties
                recognise that. It is not responsible to leave lying around many
                hundreds, if not thousands, of weapons and quantities of
                bomb-making material in Northern Ireland and the Republic of
                Ireland. Modern weapons do not rust if they are stored carefully
                — which is probably the case in these instances — so the
                danger is always present. It is important that decommissioning
                take place, not only to deprive other people of the opportunity
                of using the weapons, but as an indication that people are not
                reserving for themselves the possibility of a future resort to
                violence. It is an indicator of future intent.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If there had been any clear expressions of
                future intent over the past three and a half years, things might
                have been different. We did not even receive what I asked for on
                the afternoon of 10 April 1998 when the Good Friday Agreement
                was signed, which was for people to say that the war was over.
                There have been no clear statements or any clear actions to
                indicate intent.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As others have done, we must emphasise that
                the retention of a private army shows that there is no
                commitment to exclusively peaceful and democratic means. Even if
                the private army were wholly inactive, its mere existence shows
                that those people are not committed to exclusively peaceful
                means. If one is committed to exclusively peaceful means, there
                will be no private army.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall restate the commitments that were
                made and will go back to the agreement and beyond, right back to
                the Mitchell principles, published in January 1996 and endorsed
                by Sinn Féin. Then, Sinn Féin members said that they would be
                committed to</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;democratic and exclusively peaceful
                means of resolving political issues; to the total disarmament of
                all paramilitary organisations; to agree that such disarmament
                must be verifiable to the satisfaction of an independent
                commission; to renounce for themselves, and to oppose any
                efforts by others, to use force, or threaten to use force, to
                influence the course or the outcome of all-party negotiations;
                to agree to abide by the terms of any agreement reached in
                all-party negotiations and to resort to democratic and
                exclusively peaceful methods in trying to alter any aspect of
                that outcome with which they may disagree; and to urge that ‘punishment’
                killings and beatings stop; and to take effective steps to
                prevent such actions.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have read out the Mitchell principles in
                full because they are, sadly, still relevant to the state of
                society in Northern Ireland. Those principles were agreed by the
                parties in January 1996, and here we are in October 2001. Have
                all parties in the Chamber taken effective steps to prevent
                punishment killings and beatings? They have not.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Mitchell principles were subsequently
                incorporated in the Good Friday Agreement. The commitment to
                exclusively peaceful and democratic means is cited again and
                again in the agreement. I could refer to paragraph 4 of the
                declaration of support, or to paragraph (b) of the Pledge of
                Office in annex A of strand one, in which there is reference to
                the commitment to non- violence and exclusively peaceful and
                democratic means. There are over half a dozen points at which
                that commitment occurs. That is the first Mitchell principle.</p>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second Mitchell principle, which refers
                to</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;the total disarmament of all
                paramilitary organisations&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">is also in the agreement, in the section on
                decommissioning. Paragraph 3 states:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;All participants accordingly reaffirm
                their commitment to the total disarmament of all paramilitary
                organisations.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That in itself is a commitment and an
                obligation. That in itself imposes an obligation on all
                participants with regard to the disarmament of paramilitary
                organisations. I know that there is a qualification to that —
                the qualification that refers to working constructively and in
                good faith — which is frequently resorted to by those who
                pretend that they have no obligation. However, that qualifier is
                merely a statement that people will act in good faith, which is
                assumed to be the case for all the obligations that people
                undertake. In any event, the second sentence, in which it
                appears, refers only to the timescale, not to the obligation
                itself. There is no doubt, therefore, that there is an
                obligation in the agreement. I make that point in order to
                establish that people have been in breach of that obligation
                ever since the agreement was made.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The interpretation of the agreement that I
                have given also gains support from a certain letter — a
                significant letter — which was sent to me by the Prime
                Minister on the afternoon of 10 April 1998. It is significant
                because it was issued and circulated before the agreement was
                made, and it was not objected to by any party to the agreement.
                Consequently, in so far as it gave us an interpretation of the
                agreement, it is to be regarded as an authoritative
                interpretation of that part of the agreement. The letter said:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;I confirm that in our view the effect
                of the decommissioning section of the agreement, with
                decommissioning schemes coming into effect in June, is that the
                process of decommissioning should start right away.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That was written before the agreement was
                made. It was circulated and not objected to, and, consequently,
                it is an authoritative interpretation of the agreement.
                Therefore, since June 1998 Republicans — Sinn Féin — have
                been in breach of the agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We would all have liked the Government to
                have been more active in enforcing that obligation and in
                proceeding against those who were in breach of the agreement.
                The obvious way to do that would have been by linking
                decommissioning with prisoner releases. Unfortunately, they did
                not do that. However, because of the failure of Republicans to
                keep to the agreement — they were in breach of the agreement
                — the Government, on two occasions, proposed modifications to
                the procedures in the agreement in response. The first of those
                was included in the Hillsborough declaration of 1 April 1999.
                Proposed nominations for the posts of Ministers were to be made,
                but those would fail to take effect if there were no
                decommissioning. Secondly, the paper of 2 July 1999, entitled
                ‘The Way Forward’, formally proposed the suspension of
                devolution if no decommissioning occurred.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are three important points about those
                papers. First, in the paper of 1 April 1999, Sinn Féin
                expressly accepted the obligation to decommission. The paper
                said:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;There is agreement among all parties
                that decommissioning is not a pre-condition but is an obligation
                deriving from their commitment in the Agreement.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It also stated:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Sinn Féin have acknowledged these
                obligations.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The obligation was in the agreement, and Sinn
                Féin was in breach of it from June 1998. In June 1998, as
                Members will recall, Sinn Féin was in denial about the
                obligation, but in April 1999 it expressly accepted the
                obligation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The 2 July paper reaffirmed the principles
                agreed by the parties on 25 June, which put inclusiveness and
                decommissioning side by side. The parties agreed to three
                principles on 25 June: the principle of an inclusive Executive;
                the decommissioning of paramilitary weapons by May 2000; and
                decommissioning to be carried out in a manner determined by the
                Independent International Commission on Decommissioning. Those
                three principles were agreed, and I noticed at the time that Mr
                Pat Doherty of Sinn Féin said that the three principles —
                firmly embedded in the terms of the Good Friday Agreement —
                could resolve the impasse if there was the political will. Over
                the past three years, where was the political will? Where was
                the absence of will? Some things have happened, and some things
                have not.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The third point is that the 2 July paper
                provided for suspension, and that was agreed by the Irish
                Government. A myth is growing, supported by some so-called
                academic writers, that suspension in some way creates
                constitutional difficulties for the Irish Government; that is
                bunkum. The Irish Government agreed and proposed suspension. The
                2 July paper itself said that the Governments — plural —</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;undertake that, in accordance with the
                review provisions of the agreement, if commitments under the
                agreement are not met, either in relation to decommissioning or
                to devolution, they will automatically, and with immediate
                effect, suspend the operation of the institutions set up by the
                agreement.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The words</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">

                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">are useful in the present context. Indeed,
                the Irish Prime Minister made his support for suspension in that
                situation explicit when he said in the Dáil on 23 November 1999
                that, if there were default, the two Governments would</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;step in and assume their
                responsibilities, including … appropriate suspension
                arrangements.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unfortunately, as we know, there was no
                progress during the summer of 1999. It was not until after the
                Mitchell review that devolution occurred. Indeed, in bringing
                devolution about at the end of November 1999, we demonstrated
                our political will. The best — though rather pithy —
                statement about the precise content of that review was that made
                by the deputy leader of the SDLP, Mr Mallon, who said that the
                SDLP had been told by Senator Mitchell that he understood that
                devolution would happen on 29 November and that decommissioning
                would start by the end of January 2000. That was, indeed, the
                understanding. From my own direct knowledge, I can say that the
                Sinn Féin negotiators were left in absolutely no doubt by us,
                and by George Mitchell, about the importance of 31 January. It
                was made absolutely clear:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;31 January is the final cut-off
                date&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We proceeded to put devolution in place on
                the understanding that there would be decommissioning, but
                unfortunately, by 31 January, it had not happened. That prompted
                the Government, in fulfilment of their promise, to suspend the
                Assembly and its associated institutions in February 2000. It is
                rather sad that, in October 2001, we are back at exactly the
                same point, without having made as much progress as we would
                have liked.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Suspension in 2000 produced results. One
                result came as the 22 May deadline loomed — there was movement
                from Republicans in the shape of the IRA statement of 6 May
                2000. The crucial aspect of that statement was the promise made
                by the Republican movement that it would initiate a process that
                would put its weapons beyond use and, moreover, that it would do
                so in a way that would maximise public confidence. We look back
                at May 2000 and ask ourselves what exactly has been done to
                maximise public confidence.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Governments, of course, had some
                foreknowledge of that statement. We know that because, on the
                previous day — 5 May — they made a statement that set June
                2001 as the date for the full implementation of the agreement.
                In that context, full implementation includes decommissioning.
                The Governments made that statement because we were approaching
                22 June 2000 — the deadline set in the agreement — without
                decommissioning. The deadline for full implementation was moved
                forward to June 2001.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the basis of the promise made by
                Republicans, we agreed to re-form the administration, and we did
                that. Moreover, we re-formed it in a way that did not set an
                explicit time for reconsideration. In our operations in June
                1999, we had announced a date on which the Ulster Unionist
                Council would meet to consider the situation. We did not make
                that an explicit deadline, although people interpreted it as
                such and we were criticised for that. On re-forming the
                administration, we did not therefore set any explicit time for
                reconsideration. The leader of Sinn Féin will recall that we
                spoke together on one occasion immediately after the summer of
                2000. On that occasion, I lamented the fact that we were not
                seeing steady progress on the decommissioning track and said
                that, without progress, a crisis would be inevitable — even if
                we did nothing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I explained our position to our party
                conference on 7 October. I am tempted to recall the precise
                words that I used on that occasion, but I will not, because time
                is pressing. I made it clear that we would take action if
                Republicans failed to make progress. I did not announce the
                action at that stage, because I suspected that some of my dearly
                beloved party colleagues would use Sinn Féin’s failure to
                move as an excuse to summon a meeting of the Ulster Unionist
                Council, with a view to changing party policy. Although we had a
                clear plan of action on 7 October, we held back until 27
                October. On that day, I announced our decision to exclude Sinn
                Féin representatives from participation in the North/South
                Ministerial Council. We have sustained that exclusion since and
                will, if necessary, continue to sustain it until such times as
                the Sinn Féin Ministers demonstrate clearly that they are no
                longer in breach of the agreement. So far they have failed to do
                that, but we hope that they will.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Education (Mr McGuinness):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the leader of the Ulster Unionist Party
                give way?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Trimble:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No. I am sorry, but I will not give way. I am
                running short of time. I am often told that, at party meetings,
                I bore the party into submission, and it looks as though I am
                doing that on this occasion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We took action in October with regard to Sinn
                Fein’s failure. We proceeded in a careful and graduated way.
                There was a reason for that. We are not using decommissioning as
                an excuse to destroy devolution. Our objective was, and is, to
                achieve devolution and decommissioning; even my opponents in the
                party understood that. The alternative proposals put to the
                council on that date — over the signature of, among others,
                Jeffrey Donaldson — expressly endorsed the concept of
                inclusive devolution. The significance of that has not been
                fully appreciated.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We could not wait for ever. We had
                consultations in the party in January, and there was a consensus
                that 2001, the date set by the Government, was the key date. To
                convey the importance of that to the public, I made it clear on
                the anniversary of the IRA promise that if there were no
                decommissioning by June, I would resign with effect from 1 July.
                I kept my promise.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A further three months have elapsed, and it
                is, consequently, inevitable that we come to this point. The
                motion and the consequent withdrawal of Ministers are the
                logical and inevitable results of that resignation, and that was
                the inevitable consequence of the failure of the Republican
                movement to keep its word.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When I announced the resignation on 8 May,
                there was an interesting comment in ‘The Irish News’
                editorial the following day:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;the circumstances might have been
                different if the IRA ceasefire had been properly observed, but
                this has simply not been the case.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nor has it. There have been 30 murders by the
                IRA since the ceasefires, and matters are not improving. We
                cannot see any progress on that.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.30 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have seen the dreadful behaviour that has
                been occurring in north Belfast; the behaviour of the Loyalists
                in Ardoyne is dreadful. However, we must bear in mind that that
                comes after Sinn Féin spent the summer hotting up the
                interfaces of north Belfast and after an attack, in June, by
                Republicans on Loyalists in the Protestant part of Ardoyne.
                Therefore one must remember where the origins of that were.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After the summer I said that Republicans have
                no credibility left with any segment of Unionist opinion and
                very little credibility without it. I hope, even at this late
                stage, that Republicans will make some effort to rebuild
                credibility, but they must do it clearly, cleanly, openly and
                honestly. I hope that that happens.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are two motions today. There was the
                possibility of a joint motion with the DUP. I was not
                enthusiastic about a joint motion. It would have made the debate
                a clash between two sectarian blocks — Unionists on this side
                and Nationalists on the other. I thought that undesirable. To
                avoid that situation I was prepared to risk what might have been
                the embarrassing consequence of not getting the necessary
                signatures. I did not want to turn the debate into a sectarian
                confrontation. There are some Members who would like that, but I
                do not want that. I must ask the SDLP to consider carefully what
                it will do. Will it allow the debate to become a purely
                sectarian confrontation? Will it vote with Sinn Féin purely out
                of sectarian solidarity? Will it endorse the position that I
                think it ought to — namely, that a clear obligation has not
                been kept and there are consequences that must flow from that?
                If it is not prepared to do that now, when will it do that? How
                much longer must we wait? We have waited three and a half years
                since the agreement. We have waited nearly a year and a half
                since forming the Administration. Promises that were made by
                Republicans during that time have not been kept; violence has
                continued. There comes a point where a line must be drawn or the
                community will come to the conclusion that the process is
                failing and will not achieve its results.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As was said in one of the Dublin newspapers
                yesterday, the action that I am taking is done in the hope that
                we will preserve the agreement. There is more to the agreement
                than the participation of Sinn Féin, desirable though that
                might be. We must consider how to preserve what is important and
                see whether that can still provide a basis for society here to
                move on. I hope that it will, but I believe that the action we
                are taking today is necessary, just as it was in February 2000.
                I believe that it will be fruitful, just as that action was
                fruitful. The only question is how long we will have to wait,
                and that is a question I must leave with others.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are debating the issue against the
                background of another bigger conflict and the consequences of
                terrorism elsewhere. It would be appropriate for my Colleagues
                and I, and for many people in the Chamber, to say that, while we
                must focus on our own circumstances, we do so conscious of a
                sense of solidarity with those people in the United States who
                were recently the victims of terrorism; with the American and
                British Governments in the action that they are taking; and with
                our own armed forces that have been in action today. They have
                our full support and will continue to have it, regardless of
                what problems we have here. We are conscious that we operate in
                a wider world and have obligations to the rest of our nation and
                to the world as a whole.</p>

                exclusively peaceful and democratic means.&quot;</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I could bridle against that, or I could
                outline the background of the Members on the opposite Benches
                who are either in the armed forces of the state or the
                unnofficial armed forces of the state. However, I will not do
                that because I agree with David Trimble — the fact that a
                person has a past does not mean that he cannot have a future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to make one thing clear: there is no
                basis for the exclusion of this party or for motions to exclude
                this party. There is no basis in the agreement for this sort of
                motion. I listened to what Mr Trimble said, and I want to make
                it clear that Sinn Féin has honoured every commitment that it
                made. It may not be good enough, and the party has a lot more to
                do, but it has tried to play a positive, leadership role in the
                peace process. Sinn Féin has taken risks; it changed its party
                policy; it changed its party constitution and created real
                initiatives — all to advance the peace process and demonstrate
                a real, forward-thinking way of advancing the search for peace.
                The motion is about the battle within Unionism — it is about
                the battle for the leadership of Unionism at this difficult time
                for Unionism.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sinn Féin has worked hard and consistently
                in the Assembly. The party’s two Ministers — the Minister of
                Education, Martin McGuinness, and the Minister of Health, Social
                Services and Public Safety, Bairbre de Brún — have carried
                out their duties without favour and in an exemplary manner. At
                every level of the structures that were established under the
                agreement — the all-Ireland structures, the implementation
                bodies and the Committees — Sinn Féin members have performed
                their duties with diligence. I reject the motion, and I reject
                the accusations that were directed at the party to excuse the
                behaviour of Unionism.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No one is surprised at the motion from the
                DUP. Some of the smaller parties that have become smaller since
                they came in here are resolutely opposed to the peace process
                and have said so from the very beginning. The DUP never had the
                gumption to deal with the issues properly with Sinn Féin or the
                Ulster Unionist Party. At every opportunity the DUP has sought
                to undermine and frustrate the potential for progress and the
                Good Friday Agreement. It does so because it is against change
                — that is the reason. It is against the principles of
                inclusiveness, equality and justice. The DUP draws its
                aspirations and inspirations from the old failed politics of the
                apartheid system that used to exist here. It is anti-Catholic,
                anti- Nationalist and anti-democratic — <i>[Interruption].</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The DUP’s political philosophy, which is
                shared by some legal types opposite me, is based on
                discrimination, prejudice and real fear. It has a lack of
                confidence in itself to make peace and to move forward with
                other people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I reject that philosophy, as will all
                thinking people. However, the DUP has a mandate, which we must
                recognise. We must try to come to terms with that party’s
                opposite view of the world. It is also interesting that, of all
                the parties, the DUP takes the most delight from being here and
                from the influence that comes from attending this institution.
                Essentially, the DUP’s big problem is that there are Fenians
                about the place — and that we are Fenians who are unrepentant,
                who can represent our constituency, and who also have a vision
                for the future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Regrettably, there are those in the UUP who
                share that odd, quaint and played-out old view of the world.
                While some in the UUP signed up for the Good Friday Agreement,
                they did not really support the fundamental changes that it
                required. From the beginning they refused to embrace the
                principles at the heart of the agreement. They engaged
                tactically and initiated an approach, the purpose of which was
                to dilute the potential of that historic breakthrough.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">David Trimble was forthright earlier. In his
                letter of last October, and in his remarks to the UUP
                conference, he said that he was about achieving suspension of
                the institutions by creating a rolling crisis within the process
                and seeking to blame Republicans and Nationalists.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have no doubt that the issue of weapons is
                a huge one for Unionists, as it is for Republicans and
                Nationalists. Many people listening to the debate will question
                whether the focus is on only one section of the arms debate.
                They will ask why Unionism is silent, or at the very most
                mumbling, about the almost 250 bomb attacks and the other
                killings and attempted killings that have taken place. The
                Unionists must also bear in mind that many people do not
                understand why a Unionist leader has not walked up to Holy Cross
                Primary School with the little Catholic schoolchildren.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, Members on this side of the Chamber
                may appreciate that there are real concerns in the Unionist
                fixation on IRA guns. Apart from the tactical use of the issue
                as a blockage and a precondition for progress, there are other
                real concerns. We must ask ourselves how we can seek to sort
                that out. Can it be sorted out with people who will not even
                talk to us — people who are perhaps decent enough within their
                own families, but who reduce the debate to cat-calling across
                the Floor? Can it be sorted out with people who are in denial,
                who will not even ask why there had to be a peace process and a
                Good Friday Agreement in the first place? <i>[Interruption].</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Trimble brought us to the core of the flaw
                in the process. That flaw was the letter that MrBlair gave him
                at the time of the Good Friday Agreement negotiations. We all
                know that the letter is worthless, but Unionists have clung to
                it since then, and that is the fault-line. Every crisis since
                that Good Friday can be traced to that point. The letter showed
                a willingness on the part of the British Government to pander to
                Unionism, to acquiesce to a Unionist veto and to create a space
                for those who wanted to hollow out, and seek a renegotiation of,
                the agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is also clear that the British Government
                have not honoured their obligations or commitments under the
                Good Friday Agreement — on policing and demilitarisation, on
                equality and on justice issues. We have done our best and will
                continue to do so.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Just for the record, it is worth noting that
                great progress has been made on a range of issues, not least
                that of IRA weapons.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.45 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are two indisputable facts. First, the
                peace process exists because of initiatives taken by
                Republicans. While others have conspired to weaken, fracture,
                collapse or bore us all to submission, we have wedded ourselves
                to continue a succession of initiatives with the objective of
                enhancing the process. Secondly, no matter about the heckling or
                hectoring, the lies and false accusations, Sinn Féin is
                determined to do all it can to make this process work and to
                make it work in the interests of all the people of this island.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issue of weapons can be resolved — that
                is my clear view. I also believe that if Unionists, the British
                Government, the Irish Government and all the other parties are
                prepared to work together in a true partnership, we can
                collectively, as the Good Friday Agreement says, achieve this
                goal as quickly as possible. I have said many times, and I am
                sure you will agree, that it is not possible to resolve this
                issue on terms laid down by the DUP, or indeed the UUP and the
                British Government, or on the basis of threat, veto or
                ultimatum. It can be worked out only on the basis of the Good
                Friday Agreement. And what is the mechanism for that — the
                Independent International Commission on Decommissioning (IICD).
                The IICD together with all armed groups should be allowed to get
                on with making that mechanism work.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Last month a historic breakthrough was
                rejected by Unionists — a mistake in my view. The historic
                breakthrough was when the IICD announced that it had agreed a
                scheme with the IRA to put arms completely and verifiably beyond
                use. It is also in the public arena that the IRA continues to be
                engaged with the commission. Now, if I have to listen and try to
                understand what Unionism is saying, Unionism has to understand,
                or at least try to understand it, when I say that these are not
                small, unimportant events.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No one who lived in, and survived, the 1970s,
                the 1980s, most of the 1990s, or who has any understanding at
                all of conflict resolution, Republican history or theology,
                would have considered any of these things possible back then. In
                a Republican context, these are huge developments. They actually
                point, if you have the vision to see it, to a future free from
                IRA weapons. But what has Unionism done? It has walked away from
                these openings. It refused to engage when these openings were
                created, and it is now threatening to walk away from the
                political institutions. Unionism, which said that Republicans
                would walk away, is now threatening to bring down the
                institutions. Mr Trimble has been found to have acted
                unlawfully. As a man of the law, legally trained in that
                profession, I am sure he finds this very irksome. He is the only
                one — the only one — who has been found to have acted
                unlawfully. It is he who is ignoring the mandates of all the
                other parties, the referendums on the Good Friday Agreement
                itself, his responsibilities and obligations and the obligations
                of his party under the agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ten days ago, at the Sinn Féin Ard-Fheis in
                Dublin, I said that there was no easy way to sort these issues
                out. I reiterated my commitment, and that of our leadership, to
                playing a positive leadership role in bringing a permanent end
                to political conflict on our island, including the end of
                physical-force Republicanism. Maybe Unionists do not believe me
                when I say that, but I am committed to it — I have said it
                publicly. I wonder if Unionism really wants the end of physical-
                force Republicanism. I am put in mind very much of James
                Molyneaux’s remarks that the IRA cessation of 1994 was the
                most disturbing development in the history of this statelet.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Coming out of 30 years of conflict, all of us
                perhaps have to learn that when Republicans take initiatives,
                they are seen as threatening by Unionists, and when Unionists
                behave as they do and say the things they do, that is seen as
                threatening by Republicans and Nationalists.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In respect of all of that, I am on a learning
                curve. I believe that Mr Trimble — though he may deny it —
                believes that we who have met him are committed to peaceful and
                democratic means. In my heart and mind, I believe that very
                clearly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have to continue to work in that broad
                Republican constituency, which has suffered grievously. There is
                no monopoly on suffering, but it has suffered grievously since
                partition. We are trying to bring an end to all of the armed
                groups, including the Irish Republican Army.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, perhaps to the great joy of those on
                the opposite Benches, Sinn Féin will not be any part of any
                effort to criminalise or to deem as terrorists those men and
                women who fought when they thought that they had no option, but

                It is in the interest of the whole House that Members who are on

                choice, but who had the integrity, the courage and the wisdom to
                support a peace process when they had that choice.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let me go further: as I said at the burial
                place of Tom Williams, there are brave people on all sides of
                each conflict. There are brave people in the British forces, in
                the Loyalist forces and among those who fought on the Irish
                Republican side. We have that shared past, and I urge Unionists
                to think again.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I urge Unionists to not turn their backs on
                the potential for permanent peace and a new future and to take
                up the leadership challenge presented to us all by the process.
                I ask those more enlightened Unionists who might believe that
                there is such a thing as pluralist Unionism to stop looking over
                their shoulders at less progressive elements, including the
                quaintly named Democratic Unionist Party, or even those in their
                own party who represent a minority opinion. They should give
                leadership to the section of Unionism that voted for the Good
                Friday Agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Not for one second do I underestimate the
                difficulties that the process poses and represents to Unionists.
                I do not think that people on the opposite Benches really
                appreciate the difficulties that it also presents for
                Republicans or Nationalists. However, notwithstanding that, we
                all have to make peace with each other, and we all have to get
                into the shadow of each other to get some sense of how to move
                the process forward.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We want to try to address Unionists’
                concerns in a spirit of goodwill and respect, but the process
                cannot continue to be regarded as a zero-sum gain in which
                equality, justice and democratic rights and entitlements are
                seen as concessions to Nationalists and Republicans.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The process is unique — in the Irish and
                the British experience. It presents us all with an opportunity
                to reach across divisions and try to shape out a new
                dispensation. The Good Friday Agreement is three and a half
                years old. It was a defining moment in the history of Ireland
                and the Irish peace process. It was the result of lengthy
                discussions and of protracted and difficult dialogue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unionists were not involved in that process
                — not with our party — and that is a great pity. At a time
                of international conflict, when other peace processes continue
                to disintegrate, and when we have an opportunity to demonstrate
                that there is another way, I appeal to Unionists not to squander
                that opportunity. Unionists have a different view of the
                situation, but they should take note that if the political
                institutions collapse as a result of Unionism’s refusal to
                work them, Unionism will have raised the threshold when we

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The old days are finished. We are committed
                to making the current model, even in its flawed and fractured
                form, work. Unionism must get real; the world has moved on.
                One-party rule is no longer acceptable. Nationalists and
                Republicans are no longer a powerless, abandoned, leaderless
                minority in an Orange state. Those days are gone forever.
                Unionism is no longer a monolithic power block. &quot;Not an
                inch&quot; or schoolboy hectoring from the Back Benches are no
                longer any substitute for real courage and the ability to carve
                out a real future for people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Agus seo iad mo fhocail dheireannacha. The
                Good Friday Agreement cannot be renegotiated. Conflict is not
                the way forward; dialogue is the only way forward. I call on the
                Assembly to reject the motion. Go raibh maith agat.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr Ian Paisley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome today’s debate. I regret that we
                do not have a joint Unionist motion. However, my party will vote
                for the Ulster Unionist Party motion, and I welcome the fact
                that its leader has indicated that his party will vote for our
                motion. I regret that immediate resignations will not be
                forthcoming, merely a withdrawal of all Unionists from the
                Executive. I am glad at that belated withdrawal; they should
                never have been there in the first place. My party brought down
                the first appointments to office in the Assembly, which we would
                do today if we could. We have lodged our letters of resignation,
                but those resignations should take place immediately and should
                not be postponed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Tony Blair, the Prime Minister of the United
                Kingdom, has told the people that they must make a choice. Do
                they side with justice or with terror? The Assembly must face
                that choice. No amount of special pleading by the leader of
                IRA/Sinn Féin can cover over the fact that his party is
                associated in the lodge — if I may call it that — of
                international terrorism. Who attended his party’s conference
                in Dublin? He had ETA, the Basque terrorist group in Spain, a
                representation from the Palestine Liberation Organisation and
                Puerto Rican separatists in attendance. What are his men doing
                in Colombia with terrorists — the Revolutionary Armed Forces
                of Colombia (FARC)? That group kidnapped three missionaries from
                the New Tribes Mission organisation in 1993, whom it has now
                murdered. Is that freedom fighting? That is an act of murder and
                terrorism.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">IRA/Sinn Féin says that Unionists are not
                with it. There has been a change across the whole world, and
                people are opening their eyes to what terrorism is and what it
                really intends to do. The regime established in Northern Ireland
                by the Belfast Agreement shares the same characteristics of that
                of the Taliban in Afghanistan. Men of violence who have actively
                supported terrorism in any so-called democratic Government can
                no longer be tolerated in Northern Ireland. That is injustice at
                its height. It demeans, not enhances, the democratic process.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.00 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Rumsfeld, the US Defense Secretary, said
                yesterday that harbouring a terrorist carries a price. If
                Northern Ireland continues to harbour terrorism in its
                Government, that also carries a price. That price has been too
                high, and the consequences are clear for all to see.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have a corrupt arrangement that postpones
                violence until the men of violence require the next concession,
                then that is followed by another threat of violence, and so
                strategically escalated concession after concession goes on.
                Today must mark the end of these concessions. Weapons that have
                the mark of the murderers’ fingerprints on them must be taken
                in and destroyed, and those who have used them must not be
                pleaded with to hand them over. The British Government should be
                honest, cease from their hypocrisy and treat all terrorists
                alike. They did not send a letter to the Afghan Government
                saying &quot;Please do this&quot;: they demanded it. The Afghan
                Government did not do it, hence the bombings and the war
                declared on international terrorism. The so-called peace process
                has not been moving towards peace but towards concession after
                concession.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The House has an opportunity to declare that
                it is with world opinion and with those who believe in
                democracy, justice, fair play and the right to live. The House
                can vote to declare on whose side it is. Terrorists have no
                place in a democracy, no matter from what section of the
                community they come, and they must realise that there is no
                place for them until they repent and</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;bring forth fruits meet for
                repentance&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Why does IRA/Sinn Féin want to keep its
                weapons? Why does it not hand them over? If it is dedicated to
                peace and living in peace with its Unionist neighbours and the
                rest of the community, as we have heard today, why does it hold
                on to its murder weapons? Murder weapons have to be surrendered.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We also have the hiding of those murder
                weapons and the immunity given to that hiding by the Government
                of the Irish Republic. Let the Governments of the world come
                clean on this issue and declare to all terrorists, including
                IRA/Sinn Féin that is represented in this House, that this day
                is over. All terrorism must be dealt with, and all terrorists
                must suffer as a result, by ridding them of the weapons that
                they keep in reserve so that they can continue to blackmail
                democratic people and squeeze concessions from them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The time has come for action. We will not get
                cross- community support today. Members will not vote for the
                motion because, along with IRA/Sinn Féin, they are tied in to a
                process that they think will eventually bring about a united
                Ireland. I have more votes from the people of Ulster than any
                other politician in this House or outside, and I say that Ulster’s
                Unionist people will not be beaten. They will stand for what is
                their right — to decide their future as part of this United
                Kingdom. No amount of blackmail, murder, terrorism or tormenting
                the people of this land will bring the Ulster Unionist people to
                their knees.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are going to defend that which is our
                right. With no malice against anyone, we believe that all men
                should be equal under the law and all men equally subject to the
                law. Until the leader of IRA/Sinn Féin learns that lesson,
                there will be no peace in this Province.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Think of the orphans. Think of the widows.
                Think of those who mourn today, and as we think of them, let us
                think of the insult that has been hurled in their faces by Mr
                Adams that the men who shot down their loved ones were freedom
                fighters — freedom fighters who killed innocent children and
                innocent babes-in-arms, who murdered fathers before their
                families and carried out atrocity after atrocity. When votes of
                sympathy were passed in public places, they refused even to
                stand to their feet, but identified themselves with all the
                terror and bloodletting that had been brought about.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today, the House must declare what side it is
                on. Unionists will be declaring that they are not on the side of
                terror.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Mallon:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is with a sense of loss that I rise to
                speak to the motion, a sense of loss with the realisation that
                the opportunity to create a template for conflict resolution
                that could be used around the world is being put in abeyance. I
                do not say lost, but put in abeyance for some considerable time.
                I remember President Clinton’s visit to Armagh, when he made
                the point that he could now go to any other country in the world
                and tell his hosts that they could solve their problems by
                looking at how they were solved in Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also have a sense of sadness. In two weeks’
                time, there will be nobody sitting on these Benches. In two
                weeks’ time, there will probably be no Assembly sitting. In
                two weeks’ time, all decisions will be moved from here to the
                Northern Ireland Office, to those who come here, do their jobs
                diligently, but without the commitment that is in the Assembly
                and the Executive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have a sense of futility that, given what
                is happening throughout the world, and the enormity and
                complexity of those problems, we have squabbled our way once
                again into suspension and put at risk that which is absolutely
                essential to making the new future that we all seek.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is a matter of regret that the Ulster
                Unionist Party has tabled this motion. Its members were highly
                committed, able negotiators in the talks leading up to the Good
                Friday Agreement. They have been very able Colleagues in the
                Executive. However, this motion is a mistake. It is no different
                from earlier motions and attempts by the DUP and others to
                destroy the agreement. It has been initiated by the
                Burnside-Donaldson axis in imitation of DUP tactics.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Previous motions of this nature were rightly
                described by the Ulster Unionist leadership as stunts. They knew
                that they would not be successful. You cannot solve the type of
                problems we have with stunts, whether they come from the DUP,
                the UUP or any other party under any type of pressure. This is
                really about the internal power play of Unionism within the
                Ulster Unionist Party and between the UUP and the DUP.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is an unseemly struggle for who leads
                Unionism. In a fight such as this logic and principle are very
                often forgotten, and that is happening now.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Look at the irony in that one of the parties
                to the motion speaks and interprets for Loyalist paramilitarism;
                so that attendant to this Ulster Unionist Party motion are the
                opinions which are seen manifest in bomb explosions, vitriol,
                sectarianism and the type of attacks that we have seen. The
                Ulster Unionist Party is a proud party; it does not need that
                type of association.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our party has consistently worked throughout
                to establish the institutions. Our record of working in
                partnership with the Ulster Unionist and Sinn Féin Ministers in
                the Executive speaks for itself. At the same time, we have
                argued consistently for the putting of arms beyond use. We have
                supported, and not interfered with, the efforts of the two
                Governments and the Independent International Commission on
                Decommissioning. In doing that, I have no sympathy whatsoever
                with the Republican movement — indeed, I recognise the
                overwhelming onus on it to honour its commitments and to follow
                the primary responsibility, which is there for all of us in the
                Good Friday Agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Decommissioning was settled by the agreement,
                which recalled that its resolution</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;is an indispensable part of the process
                of negotiation&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The agreement sets out the commitment of all
                participants to the total disarmament of all paramilitary
                organisations. How often have I heard people dismissing this as
                an irrelevancy, as an unreasonable Unionist demand? How often
                have I heard it said that they will not jump to meet the desires
                and needs of a British Government; that this is not what
                Republican areas and supporters want; that this is, indeed, an
                impossibility? What they have been doing, in effect, is
                signalling their unwillingness to implement the agreement fully,
                thus undermining Unionist confidence with it and defying the
                will of the Irish people who voted in such overwhelming numbers
                for the total disarmament of all paramilitary organisations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A heavy onus now falls on the Republican
                leadership to undo the damage that has been done and to turn the
                recently emphasised commitment to decommissioning into effective
                action. Words are not enough; deeds speak. The SDLP in
                conformity with the agreement seeks the completion of
                decommissioning to the satisfaction of Gen de Chastelain — no
                more, no less. I do not know whether, or when, that will happen,
                but I know, and I believe that everyone in the Chamber believes,
                that without decommissioning, the agreement will not survive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Without decommissioning and the standing-down
                of paramilitary organisations, there will not be reconciliation
                and political stability on the island of Ireland. Without
                decommissioning, the time will come — and maybe has come —
                when there will not be any room in public or democratic life
                throughout the world for parties associated with paramilitary
                organisations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Shortly after I became Deputy First Minister
                Designate, I said that the agreement gave us the opportunity to
                build something new for ourselves and to change utterly that
                which had gone before. I still believe that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly, the Executive and the
                North/South bodies have proved their value and potential.
                Northern Ireland, and the whole island, is a better place
                because of their operation. They have provided the setting for a
                bright economic period and have enhanced the potential for
                investment.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is thanks to those bodies that the
                community, which Members lead, won the battle against
                foot-and-mouth disease. Even in the difficult circumstances of
                the past fortnight the Executive were able to produce a draft
                Programme for Government and a draft Budget and make strategic
                decisions on gas pipelines and roads that will improve people’s
                lives. There have also been decisions that will begin to help in
                the difficult process of bringing peace to north Belfast. I pay
                tribute to Sir Reg Empey who has been a good colleague in recent
                times in the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First
                Minister.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I conclude with a plea to those who have
                tabled motions today and to those who have caused the motions to
                be tabled: it is seldom in the history of any area that has
                suffered conflict resolution that all of the ingredients for a
                solution are in place. We have the agreement; we have the
                institutions; we have the machinery; and we have the panoply of
                support that is essential. What would some of the countries
                involved in conflict give to have those advantages? What would
                they give to have the agreement, the institutions and the
                machinery for solving problems? Do not throw the opportunity
                away. Do not squabble this political generation into political
                extinction. Use it; use it now; and use it well.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thank you, Mr Speaker, and thanks to the fan
                club on the Unionist Back Benches. I also thank Mr Adams for his
                kind words to me and for the words of tribute that he paid to my
                predecessor and friend, Sean Neeson.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no doubt that since the referendum
                was held we have encountered multiple problems in implementing
                the agreement — decommissioning is the biggest problem. Those
                problems have arisen because Republicans and Loyalists have
                failed to live up to their obligations, at least under the terms
                as everyone else views them. However, in the case of Loyalist
                paramilitaries there are no Ministers, so no exclusion motion is
                appropriate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issue before the House should be simple:
                it should be one of democrats versus those who are still
                prepared to resort to violence. Those who have a past are
                entitled to have a future, but some do not seem to want a
                present. This morning Mr Adams treated the House to a rehash of
                the Ard-Fheis speech. I do not expect him to condemn his
                comrades for their past activities; I am realistic enough in
                that regard. However, in the Chamber today Members expect to
                hear a clear, strong lead from every party as to the way of the
                future, and I regret that they have not heard that in the detail
                that they should have done.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr D McClelland] in the
                Chair)</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many groups have engaged in violence and, Mr
                Deputy Speaker, you will know as well as I do that there have
                been three murders in south Antrim recently — all committed by
                Loyalists. Ironically, two of the victims were Protestants who
                were assumed to be Catholics. In all of this Sinn Féin will
                argue that its guns have been silent since 1994, but,
                unfortunately and palpably, that is not the case. There have
                been numerous beatings and shootings, and up to 30 murders have
                been committed against dissidents and drug dealers. There is a
                warped notion that one can kill without impugning the ceasefire
                so long as it is only a case of Unionists killing Protestants or
                Nationalists killing Catholics. The Alliance Party considers
                that the integrity of the ceasefire does not depend upon the
                interplay between the religion and politics of the victim and
                the perpetrator respectively.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Trimble said that he did not wish to have
                a single Unionist motion because he did not wish the motion to
                be regarded as being sectarian. I found that bizarre. Once David
                Trimble and his Colleagues sought to co-opt the PUP to signing
                their motion it became a simple issue of Unionist versus
                Nationalist; not an issue of democrats against those who resort
                to violence.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On Saturday, I heard Mr Ervine say that
                decommissioning was just around the corner. I therefore presume
                that he feels that the motion, in the context of unilateral
                sanctions, is going to help, not hinder. I would like him to
                explain how those sanctions could possibly be beneficial.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Trimble has compounded his error — the
                error of being sectarian and making it a purely Unionist matter
                — by trying, yet again, to impose a deadline. That is
                particularly surprising, given that he highlighted in his speech
                the occasions when he had not imposed a deadline and when he had
                tried not to have one. By his actions over recent weeks and by
                his threat of what he and his Colleagues will do when the motion
                falls, he has again imposed a deadline. Experience has proved
                that deadlines have never worked and will never work in the
                process. The unilateral Unionist deadline that almost
                destabilised the Mitchell review in late 1999 was a classic
                example of that. There are other examples. Unilateral deadlines
                have never worked, because the talks process never worked on
                that basis. It worked when it was inclusive, when people were
                brought together and when they sought to reach an accommodation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The sanctions on North/South meetings, which
                have been in place over the past year, not only did not work but
                have been held by two courts to be illegal. Today Mr Trimble
                seemed to rejoice in that judgement because he was playing
                politics and misusing the courts. It was not the legal system;
                it was a matter of his use of the courts to make a political
                point.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the UUP is serious about decommissioning,
                and if it wants the Assembly to consider matters in a genuine,
                balanced way, why did it put forward this pan-Unionist motion?
                Why did it not talk to the SDLP, the NIWC or Alliance about how
                there might be joint action to confirm the integrity of the
                process and to ensure that decommissioning happened? It knows
                that exclusion could only be a realistic prospect if there were
                widespread agreement, yet it has not sought that agreement. It
                is simply playing Unionist politics.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Following the summer holiday excursions to
                Colombia and the dreadful events of 11 September in New York and
                Washington, there is worldwide pressure on any organisation that
                is carrying out acts of terrorism. However, today, the day after
                British forces, as Mr Trimble has highlighted, went into action
                against the Taliban and Osama bin Laden, the Ulster Unionist
                party is giving the IRA &quot;wriggle room&quot;. This is the
                only way that it can be presented. The rest of the world is
                turning against terrorist groups while Unionists are taking that
                pressure off by being unilateral and one-sided.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Mr Mallon reminded us in July, the
                Government have responsibilities in this area, yet they have
                taken no action. Mr Mallon implied that if the Government were
                prepared to take action, he would follow it through. I trust
                that if they do take action, the SDLP will live up to that
                promise.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unionists and Republicans have groups that
                are allegedly on ceasefire and which have taken no action on
                decommissioning. Decommissioning is long overdue on the part of
                all paramilitary groups, including those linked to Sinn Féin,
                the PUP and the UDP.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is the serious issue of the removal of
                weapons, but the motion is not dealing with that. It appears to
                have been precipitated by Ulster Unionist members such as David
                Burnside and Jeffrey Donaldson, and it is not in any way seeking
                a way forward for the institutions. It has played into the
                internal games of the Ulster Unionist Party, and it is most
                regrettable that Ulster Unionist Members of the House have taken
                the opportunity to follow it through. Perhaps the unhappy looks
                on their faces, the corridor chats last week, the talk of
                further postponement and the endeavours to avoid crisis are an
                indication of what most Unionist Members — at least those from
                the Ulster Unionist Party — really think about this.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In proposing the motion, Mr Trimble said that
                his objective was to have both decommissioning and devolution.
                However, the motion is merely attempting to buy off his internal
                dissidents. The motion, followed by further threats of
                resignation, has, as Mr Mallon has just said, every potential to
                destroy devolution without bringing decommissioning any further
                forward. It should be resisted.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the light of the horrific terrorist
                activity in the United States of America on 11 September one
                could be forgiven for believing that the people of Northern
                Ireland would expect something different in the approach to
                terrorism from Northern Ireland parties. We have listened to Mr
                Mallon’s words and to the approach of the SDLP. We need to
                bear in mind that that party is washing its hands like Pontius
                Pilate and refusing to join with other democrats in excluding
                from Government those who are inextricably linked to a terrorist
                organisation. No amount of smoke, mirrors or imagery will change
                that fact.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Trimble has laid out a catalogue of blame
                for the plight that those of us who are committed to peaceful
                and democratic means find ourselves in. He mentioned the British
                Government and Mr Blair’s betrayal of the pledges that he made
                that those involved in and inextricably linked to terrorist
                organisations would not remain in Government. In the referendum
                Mr Trimble encouraged the people of Northern Ireland to support
                that position and endorsed the Prime Minister’s guarantee. The
                Irish Government also had a duty. Mr Trimble reminded us that we
                are three and a half years into the process and still not one
                ounce of Semtex or one bullet has been handed in by the IRA.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We would have expected different things from
                those in authority in the United States of America. Not one
                person whom I have spoken to or met with has not been amazed by
                the events in Dublin at the weekend when the United States of
                America’s Ambassador to Ireland attended the terrorist
                conference and brought the American Administration into
                disrepute. Circumstances such as that have contributed to the
                fact that Sinn Féin is in the Government here today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A crucial question has to be asked about the
                Ulster Unionist Party’s involvement in bringing about the
                present situation. It is clear that Mr Trimble has discredited a
                worthwhile and needed debate on the exclusion of those
                inextricably linked to terror by aligning himself with, and
                seeking the support of, those who are fronting Protestant,
                Loyalist paramilitary activity. That he did so to enable himself
                to table a motion to exclude those who are involved in armed
                Republicanism has everyone aghast.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Trimble did not need to do that to achieve
                today’s debate. He could, personally, have walked into the
                Business Office any time during the past 12, 18 or 24 months and
                signed any one of the various motions in the name of the DUP,
                the Northern Ireland Unionist Party, Mr McCartney’s party and
                others tabled to exclude Sinn Féin, which required only one
                further signature. Mr Trimble can attempt to excuse his
                position, but that leads us to the real game plan and to the
                real reason for his taking the convoluted route of seeking the
                support of the PUP. He told my Colleagues and myself that he
                wanted to delay the motion to exclude Sinn Féin at the behest
                of MrBlair — the man who, Mr Trimble said, betrayed the
                Unionist cause and gave false promises and undertakings. This is
                the man who is still pulling the strings of Ulster Unionist
                Party policy at Glengall Street.</p>

                Féin; he has made that clear. He said that he wished to see it
                remain in Government, and he noted the valuable contribution
                that it had made to the process. Mr Trimble has embarked on a
                scheme to allow time for some act of decommissioning that will
                catapult him back into his position as First Minister, with Mr
                Mallon as Deputy First Minister. I remind Mr Trimble, and lest
                Members think that this point is hypothetical, those in the
                Government agencies in Northern Ireland —</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I say this as a warning to those in the
                Ulster Unionist camp who may weaken in the next few weeks. I
                remind Mr Trimble that he said that, even if there were to be
                some act of decommissioning by the IRA, that would not convince
                him, nor would it convince the people of Northern Ireland, that
                Sinn Féin/IRA, represented by Martin McGuinness and Gerry
                Adams, is fit to be in Government. A paramilitary organisation
                may decommission a few weapons; the LVF decommissioned weapons
                some years ago. However, I do not imagine that the family of
                Martin O’Hagan would regard that as a guarantee that that
                organisation would not return to violence.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Trimble and his Colleagues work hand in
                hand with the Government to have him and his Colleague, Mr
                Mallon, reinstated in the Northern Ireland Executive. There is
                only one way for Unionists to exclude Sinn Féin from the
                process, and it is in our hands. We cannot depend on other
                Governments or on the other people at whom Mr Trimble points the
                finger of blame. Mr Trimble and Dr Paisley could remove their
                Ministers from the Government today, and Mr McGuinness and his
                Colleague, Ms de Brún, would no longer be in the Executive. If
                we cannot have decommissioning, and if the price for Government
                in Northern Ireland is having terrorists in that Government, we
                should seek a better form of Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Trimble said that Mr Ervine and Mr
                Hutchinson had convinced him that they were in favour of peace
                and that he could do business with them. Mr Adams said that if
                that is the case, it does not matter what the IRA’s position
                is; Sinn Féin Members need only convince Mr Trimble that they
                are seeking peaceful and democratic structures in Northern
                Ireland. If Mr Trimble is to be consistent, he cannot take a
                different approach.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need to remove from the process those who
                pollute and corrupt it. Mr Trimble chided the Democratic
                Unionist Party in this Chamber for months and said that to
                withdraw Ministers would make no sense. He told the DUP that it
                was still up to its neck in the process, as he and his
                Colleagues will be for the next two weeks. Had he any integrity
                or decency, he would do what the DUP leader has done. Dr Paisley
                has proposed the immediate resignation of his Ministers. I trust
                that Mr Trimble will follow his example, and that he will not
                play around with the process any longer. The honourable and
                decent thing for Mr Trimble to do is to resign. He should
                withdraw his Ministers, and the Executive will fall today.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support both motions. Leaving aside Mr
                Cedric Wilson’s comments, I welcome the united Unionist front
                in this debate. Speeches made today have reflected the Unionist
                community’s frustration at an agreement that has failed to
                deliver and, particularly, at the inability of the forces of
                infidel Republicanism to state that the war is over and prove it
                by giving up weapons.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have said before that my difficulty with
                the Belfast Agreement was not so much decommissioning, or even
                prisoner releases, but the North/South bodies. As a Unionist, I
                had a genuine fear that they could lead to some form of joint
                authority. However, decommissioning and prisoner releases were
                also important moral issues. We are dealing with an important
                moral issue today — decommissioning.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a real need for decommissioning.
                Looking at the situation in north Belfast, with which some of us
                are familiar, and the orchestration of much of what has happened
                recently, we can see the need for some form of decommissioning.
                Over the years, 132 members of the security forces have lost
                their lives in north Belfast. More significantly, 281 Protestant
                civilians in the upper Ardoyne area have lost their lives during
                the troubles. That is why we must view the situation seriously.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issue of decommissioning concerns us all
                and must be addressed. Sinn Féin has cynically used the process
                to change its strategy. If Sinn Féin were genuinely of the
                opinion that the war was over, there would have been an element
                of repentance — an apology, or an assurance that it would not
                happen again and some evidence to show that. There has been no
                repentance. Instead, Sinn Féin cynically changed the system.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is unfortunate that when Sinn Féin
                changed its strategy to one of orchestrating violence, it knew
                exactly how people in the Protestant community would react.
                There are difficulties in the Protestant community because of
                that. Protestants have reacted predictably and, at times, have
                followed self-defeating strategies that have taken away from
                what is happening in those areas. They have distracted attention
                from the failure of the Provisional IRA to decommission and from
                the needs of a Protestant community that has suffered greatly
                — more so than the Catholic community, particularly in north
                Belfast. Attention has been deflected away from the genuine
                needs of people in those areas. It is slightly nauseating to
                hear Members of Sinn Féin deriding the large amount of money to
                be invested in north Belfast and saying that the Protestant
                community, which is greatly in need of that money, should not
                receive it because it is a payment for violence. That is untrue
                and inaccurate. Of course, Sinn Féin can, and does, get away
                with making such statements.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I understand why the Protestant community
                follows self-defeating strategies. Housing conditions in
                Protestant areas have been poor, and that problem has not been
                addressed. The Provisional IRA has failed to give up the weapons
                of war that have created such unease and uncertainty in the
                Protestant community. Attitudes in that community have hardened,
                with the result that if a referendum on the agreement were held
                today among the Protestant community, there would be a wholesale
                rejection of everything that many Members have tried to
                establish. Thankfully, I was not one of those Members.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What is the difference between a freedom
                fighter and a terrorist? I am not sure. I had a strong
                Presbyterian upbringing, and, to me, right was right, and wrong
                was wrong; I still see it that way. I do not see how it can be
                said that a war is going on between the Provisional IRA and the
                British occupying forces. Where were the British occupying
                forces at La Mon, Tullyvallen, Darkley, Kingsmills and Teebane?
                Where were they on Bloody Friday — an exercise orchestrated by
                a Member of this House? Eleven people were blown to bloody
                smithereens because of the activities of that individual.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is an absolute need to give up the
                weapons of war, to decommission, if only on moral grounds. No
                one who is involved in democratic politics should be allowed to
                hold on to illegal weaponry. People are pretending to be
                involved in the democratic process but are holding on to the
                weapons of war. We all know why. They hold on because some of
                them hope to go back to war for a final push towards their
                ultimate aim. They do not realise that people down South do not
                want them either, but that is a debate for another day.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today, we are debating a serious moral issue.
                People who are involved in the democratic process do not need
                illegal arms. For those in democratic politics, there is a legal
                imperative not to hold illegal weaponry and not to be involved
                in illegal activities such as gun smuggling, protection rackets
                or bludgeoning a community into support, even if the community’s
                wish is to reject such actions. All those issues are involved.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion for all the right
                reasons. I welcome the fact that there is a united Unionist
                front. I urge the House to reject Provisional IRA/Sinn Féin and
                to exclude it from Government.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ervine:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unlike my Colleague, I hardly celebrate such
                Unionist unity. If there are as many knives in my back when I
                have finished as there were in David Trimble’s before he
                started, we will know how much Unionist unity there is.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We in the Progressive Unionist Party are
                accused of hypocrisy, and I am sure that we will be accused of
                more later. I need to clarify that my party’s policy is one of
                inclusion and pluralism; we recognise that exclusion is at the
                core of our historical difficulty. If exclusion is that core,
                inclusion is a way to correct it. I wish that it were a perfect
                world and that we could do what we wanted on any given day. We
                made a decision to sign a motion. We had never signed one
                before. Nobody was that keen on asking us, because we were
                expected to refuse.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are in an interesting phase. With or
                without this motion, we face a suspension, an election, or
                whatever the Secretary of State decides on, following
                consultation. Perhaps, however, we have an opportunity to tell
                each other the truth, to hear that there are serious problems
                and that others have not fully understood or been prepared to
                understand? I can give examples. Once, there was 72% support for
                the Good Friday Agreement. There were those who thought that 26%
                of the vote was the majority. They found out differently; there
                was a readiness in both sections of our society to try, to
                explore and to see.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When we walked out of Castle Buildings on 10
                April 1998, we all said &quot;Bye-bye&quot; to each other. We
                all sold the agreement in ways that could not be described as
                collective. We were fearful — if we cannot convince the people
                whom we need to take with us, where will we go from there? In a
                divided society, no one can convince the people whom he or she
                represents that they are going in the right direction alone;
                former enemies are also needed. If the theories and arguments
                that are being put forward are aimed at pointing people towards
                the future — along what are, undoubtedly, uncharted waters —
                those people’s representatives and their former enemies must
                tell them that they are going in the right direction. People
                need to be shown that circumstances have changed. That has not
                happened.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.45 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Trimble referred to the mention of
                decommissioning in the Downing Street declaration of 1993. I
                have never been a loud advocate of decommissioning. I have been
                a loud advocate of each person’s taking responsibility for
                identifying changes and shifts. In the first instance, in a
                divided society, that can only be a change in language. However,
                if someone is asked to say that the war is over and that person
                cannot do so, that means that the war may not be over. If there
                are so many caveats, it may not be possible to believe that it
                is over. That has been the case.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Progressive Unionist Party’s withdrawal
                from the process, after the Weston Park talks, was an
                acceptance, on our part that unless the Unionist community could
                see greater political effectiveness from the Good Friday
                Agreement we could not proceed. To achieve progress the opposite
                side must recognise the efforts of Unionists who have taken
                risks and are prepared to take greater risks. The opposite side
                must acknowledge those risk-takers, rather than believe, as it
                has consistently wanted to, that Unionism was attempting to
                exploit weakness and that there was some kind of game plan
                involving Mr Trimble and Mr Donaldson. It was thought that the
                difficulties that the Unionist leadership was experiencing were
                part of a game to box the Provos in. That could not be further
                from the truth.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The opposite side is bound to see the hatred,
                the bitterness and the venom in the Unionist community. We can
                change the old adage &quot;If you put three Republicans in a
                room, the first issue on the agenda will be a split.&quot;; now
                it is &quot;put any three Unionists in a room, and the first
                issue on the agenda will be a split.&quot; Republicans saw a
                society being salami-sliced. Some incidents were not
                individually earth-shattering but, taken as a collective, were
                nightmares for Unionists. We believed that there was a chance
                that when we explored the future, we would see the curtain come
                down on a brutal and awful past. That belief was blown out of
                the water by something as simple as the case of a lady who
                wanted to present prizes in a Catholic school. The Duchess of
                Abercorn wanted to present prizes for literature to pupils in a
                Catholic school. Sinn Féin vociferously opposed that on the
                basis that the lady is a member of the royal family. Sinn Féin
                was wrong — she is not a member of the royal family. Unionists
                reeled at that. Then, when Fr Denis Faul met the RUC to discuss
                crime levels, a crowd of Sinn Féin activists hounded Fr Faul
                and the RUC officers, and Unionists reeled at that too. We
                thought that it was OK to have that dialogue; we were told that
                dialogue worked and that we must make politics work. In his own
                inimitable way, Fr Denis Faul was trying to make something work
                for a community that was suffering from increased crime.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There was the nonsense over the Angelo Fusco
                extradition to Northern Ireland. The extradition was perfectly
                legitimate within the parameters of the Good Friday Agreement,
                but pressure exerted by Sinn Féin leaders tragically encouraged
                the Irish Government to change their mind. Unionists heard a
                certain language from the leadership of Sinn Féin but saw
                different behaviour from Sinn Féin — or in some cases IRA —
                activists. Which is the true element?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is difficult for someone who has stood
                exposed in his own community, having said that he believed that
                Sinn Féin and its leaders, Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness,
                were genuine about the future, to discover that most of his
                community, while willing to listen when the question was first
                asked, are unlikely to believe that Sinn Féin is genuine.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There will be another chance to put things
                back together. In some ways, the motion highlights the fact that
                we the Unionist community cannot be salami-sliced. The Unionist
                community cannot think that it will manage this society easily
                by itself and leave Republicanism and Nationalism behind. There
                must be a collective way to create inclusion — not a
                collective form of exclusion — so that people will be
                relatively comfortable. It might be a long time before we are
                completely comfortable. However, I appeal for us to do that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In answer to David Ford, who asked where my
                confidence in decommissioning was, I should explain the comments
                that I made on Saturday. My confidence in the delivery of
                weaponry is not founded on morality. This society uses morality
                as a weapon, which does a great disservice to our hopes for the
                future. In a divided society, there is no single overarching
                morality or truth. We can weld ourselves into a little
                homogenous unit and touch each other’s anal parts, like
                chimpanzees, for comfort, but we must learn to live together.
                The choice is simple. In order to show that politics works,
                decommissioning, or putting weapons beyond use — as some
                people like to term it — will come out of practicality, not
                morality.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Soon, we will face a choice. I hope that when
                the motion is defeated, as it undoubtedly will be, Sinn Féin
                does not spit out the dummy. I hope that it will recognise that,
                for whatever reasons, there is a requirement to give confidence
                to the Unionist community. Whatever move it makes, could it
                please ensure that that move is recognisable?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms McWilliams:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">October has turned out to be a sad month. It
                is also the month in which the Shankill bomb and the Greysteel
                murders took place. It is the month of the funeral of Marty O’Hagan,
                the first journalist to be killed in the troubles, and of the
                military response in Afghanistan. Undoubtedly, one of the
                saddest things for us is that we meet for probably one of the
                last times before we go into yet another suspension.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some of the language used today was
                important. We have heard again and again, as Mr Trimble said,
                that if a person has a past, he or she can still have a future.
                Those are important words, and they should not be disparaged. We
                should all apply those words to ourselves. I am fed up with the
                denial, the minimisation and the rationalisation that goes on
                when we talk about our past. Every one of us contributed to that
                past, so let us stop denying that we are unconnected to the
                reasons for our differences.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important that we continue to hear that
                militant Republicanism will be redundant — not in the past
                tense but, as David Ford said, in the future tense. That must be
                worked out. It is important that when Martin McGuinness, who is
                named in one of the motions today, contributed to the book ‘Being
                Irish’, he specifically addressed the Unionist people, arguing
                that</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">in what he also hoped would one day become a
                multicultural, secular society. Those sentiments would not have
                been expressed in the 1970s. However, they were expressed last
                year and continue to be expressed this year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is time to move beyond the newspaper
                articles that undermine confidence and the shock security
                disclosures of the past few months. It is also time to move
                beyond someone else’s deadlines. The IRA need not wait for the
                correct political context to be set by others — I believe that
                it is within the IRA’s power to set that context itself. That
                is why our language and our actions are important. If we go into
                review, we must ensure that the political context remains
                uppermost in our minds.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am despondent. We have one final
                opportunity not to do what we have done during every other
                review, which is to create and continue a cycle of breakdown and
                patch-up until we have almost destroyed the community’s
                confidence in our ability to make the agreement work. It is
                hurtful to use the word &quot;exclusion&quot; and tell people
                that they are not wanted, that they are to be excluded or
                marginalised — except for those who feel that they have a
                self-importance given to them at birth. It is important that,
                when an exclusion motion is tabled, or a review is entered into,
                parties realise that it is not only their issues that are on the
                agenda, but all parties’ issues. Authorship of the agreement
                is ownership of the agreement, as we should work to include all
                parties. Some Members may say things that we do not wish to
                hear; none the less, it is extremely important that we hear
                them, especially if some think that those who support the
                agreement are the minority of a majority. A majority voted for
                the agreement in the referendum. However, if those who support
                the agreement are now in the minority, we must hear them say why
                it is not working.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clarity about substantive issues and about
                the creation of relationships that enable those substantive
                issues to be dealt with makes for good negotiations. We know the
                substantive issues that contribute to making the agreement work,
                but we are useless at creating the relationships that would
                enable us to deal positively with those substantive issues. We
                must stop talking at each another and begin to talk to one
                another. To date, that major ingredient has been missing. We
                know the confidence-building measures that must be put in place.
                Our communities almost despair that we have not got enough faith
                in one another to put those confidence-building measures in
                place. Senator Mitchell said that</p>

                wife and his father-in-law, but he still believes that it was
                important for him that we put the agreement together. He
                believes more work must be done. As political leaders, the least
                that we can do is to stop demanding political progress and begin
                to work at it. If we are to go into review, the most important
                message that we can send out to people is that, this time, we
                shall set the terms of reference. It is ridiculous to talk about
                opening up the entire agreement. We know what substantive issues
                must be worked at and fixed, and that is the message that we
                must send out to the community.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCartney:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since entering the Assembly I have been
                consistent on two points. First, the political representatives
                of active terrorist organisations retaining arms have no place
                in the democratic process. Secondly, I have a committed and
                dedicated opposition to all forms of sectarianism. As far as I
                am concerned, the remarks by Mr Adams about people who do not
                want Fenians, as he described them, about the place are totally
                and completely inappropriate, and I have made that case many
                times here.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the basis of those principles there is
                absolutely no way in which, even at the price of Unionist unity
                on this, I could conceivably support the UUP motion. There is no
                basis upon which one can argue, from either a rational or a
                moral ground of justification, that a motion to exclude one
                group which is not entirely dedicated to peaceful methods should
                be supported by another group that is guilty of exactly the same
                intransigence.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Until today I had thought that if there were
                a contest for the crown of utter political hypocrisy, Mr Trimble
                and Mr Blair would be the front runners. However, Mr Adams has
                placed himself in prime position for that crown. When we hear
                people such as Mr Adams, Mr McGuinness and Mr Ervine give forth
                lofty sentiments about working together, democracy and peace, we
                have to examine their antecedents. Mr Adams himself was
                commander of the Belfast Brigade on Bloody Friday, and Mr
                McGuinness was a self-confessed officer — commanding officer,
                perhaps — in the Derry Brigade during a period when 22 people
                had their lives taken from them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We hear the mantra repeated by Mr Trimble,
                and echoed by Mr Adams, that because people have a past does not
                mean that they cannot have a future. It could be nonsense, or it
                could be true. However, the real issue is where they stand at
                present and whether they have shown any ability or capacity to
                transmute themselves from terrorist to democrat. I see no
                evidence of that. I see no such evidence because both Mr
                McGuinness and Mr Adams are members of the seven-man IRA Army
                Council, and recent information is that Mr McGuinness is now the
                general officer commanding. We have these people coming forward,
                and we have the &quot;trainspotter supreme&quot; gesticulating.
                Someone should send him a pair of binoculars so that he can see
                Mr Adams and Mr McGuinness more closely.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The truth is that Mr Trimble, as usual, has
                got absolutely nothing. He got nothing when he signed the
                agreement in April 1998. He was totally conned by Mr Blair.
                These are two lawyers. Mr Trimble is a lawyer who was conned by
                a letter from Mr Blair that gave him some sort of comfort. Mr
                Trimble should have understood that one party to a multi-party
                agreement, even if that one party were a Government, could not
                alter, amend or substitute any term of that agreement without
                the consent of all. That is the sort of stuff for first-year law
                students, not an alleged constitutional lawyer.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He desperately wanted to get his sticky
                fingers on what he believed to be the levers of power in the
                devolved Government. He got nothing after the Mitchell review in
                autumn 1999. He tells us now that George Mitchell made all sorts
                of statements about what was agreed, but when George was asked
                to make some public utterances as to what had been agreed,
                George disappeared. Mr Trimble got nothing after the
                Hillsborough talks in May 2000 either. However, before leaving
                George Mitchell’s review, I should mention the infamous letter
                of resignation. This man of political awareness and acuity was
                so confident that the IRA would decommission that he offered his
                letter of resignation if his hopes were not fulfilled.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. Can
                the Member clarify whether he is speaking for or against the
                motion?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCartney:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is not a point of order, and I do not
                have to clarify it. It is typical of the bogus points of order
                that Mr Adams engages in. The truth is that Mr Trimble got
                absolutely nothing then. Then there were the Hillsborough talks
                in May 2000. He got absolutely nothing then either. Having got
                nothing three times, he was willing to be persuaded that he
                should re-enter the Assembly and the Executive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now he is under pressure from his own party
                and believes that there is a window of opportunity because of
                the events in New York and Washington. The focus of the world
                democracies is on terrorism generally, and sooner or later it
                will be on the terrorism of the IRA. He believes that that
                provides him with an opportunity to bring this, on the face of
                it, macho motion to exclude Sinn Féin.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In truth it is nothing of the kind. In
                essence the motion is a fraud. It permits Mr Trimble to withdraw
                his Ministers, hang about for 10 days or two weeks while all
                sorts of pressures are brought on Mr Adams and Company to
                produce some absolutely worthless gesture about decommissioning
                that will enable Mr Trimble to get those sticky fingers back on
                the levers. So the UUP motion is not one that any democrat could
                support.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There was talk from Mr Mallon about stunts,
                but this is not the first time that a motion supported by every
                Unionist has come before the Assembly. In December 1998 the UKUP
                proposed a motion that every Unionist agreed with. What was that
                motion about? It was about preventing the representatives of
                paramilitary organisations who had not decommissioned from
                entering the Executive until they had shown their bona fides.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Trimble supported that motion, but a few
                months later he abandoned all that and entered, in league with
                members of Sinn Féin, into the Executive. Having got them into
                the Executive, he was faced with the problem of how he could get
                them to honour the basic requirement of any democracy. Of
                course, all along the line he failed. Now, probably in league
                with his puppet master in 10 Downing Street, he produces the
                argument that they have to be put out.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Two weeks ago I described the political
                hypocrisy of Mr Trimble as mind-boggling. That was based on his
                condemnation of the UDA for its activities in north Belfast.
                However, he used the UDA and the UVF and their political
                representatives to get the Belfast Agreement signed and to be
                elected as First Minister. Now, within two weeks, he excels even
                that level of hypocrisy by inviting the representatives of one
                set of terrorists to bring about the demise of another.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I speak in favour of the motion. I am not
                sure if there has been an amendment tabled, given the attacks on
                Mr Trimble. There is a crisis of confidence in the political
                institutions and the political process in Northern Ireland.
                Whose fault is that? Even the IRA recognises its culpability.
                Its statement spoke of putting in place a</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;confidence-building measure&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no confidence, and that lack of
                confidence has led to the motion’s coming forward. The
                Provisionals have been involved in 32 murders since 1994.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the IRA will not disarm and disband, the
                time has come for the House to ensure that its political
                representatives have no role to play in the governance of
                Northern Ireland. As a result of the terrible events in the USA
                on 11 September, the free world has changed forever. Sinn
                Féin/IRA must realise that. Its fascist campaign is over; it
                cannot be resurrected.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Prime Minister has declared war on
                terrorism. If he is serious, he could send no clearer signal of
                his intent than to start here in his backyard. I have not
                forgotten the Prime Minister’s handwritten pledges made to the
                people of Northern Ireland in May 1998. They included the
                promise that those who use or threaten violence would be
                excluded from the Government of Northern Ireland and that
                prisoners would be kept in prison unless violence was given up
                for good. I ask the Prime Minister about the promises to the
                people of Northern Ireland. He has failed us miserably.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yet Sinn Féin/IRA arrogantly continues to
                defy public opinion in Northern Ireland and the Republic of
                Ireland, and it ignores the public statements of Her Majesty’s
                Government and the Irish and American Governments.
                Decommissioning is patently not just a Unionist demand or the
                result of a Unionist deadline; it is a democratic demand and
                part of a democratic deadline. In seeking justice, we do not
                seek to bring down Stormont and the democratic institutions.
                Indeed, it is because Stormont and the democratic process mean
                so much to us and we have so much respect for them, that we
                cannot allow either this place or this process to be debased any
                longer by the presence of the political representatives of
                terror in the Government of Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Republicans confound the truth regularly,
                because the problems that they allegedly suffered under the
                Stormont Parliament come at the lower end of the scale of human
                grievances. To make comparisons with South African people under
                apartheid, as they often do, is absurd. Their comparisons only
                belittle the serious grievances suffered by those people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Republican campaign slowed down legal
                reform in Northern Ireland. The result of the IRA-inspired rape
                of this community was more hatred, distrust, bitterness and
                strife between the people of Northern Ireland. The Republican
                movement should hold its head in shame. Seven and a half years
                after Dick Spring said that the IRA must decommission, it has
                failed to do so. The Republicans are the wreckers of the Good
                Friday Agreement. Their continued campaign was, and is, wrong;
                it is criminal and filled with deceit.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As for the claim that the guns are silent —
                what nonsense. I referred to 32 people murdered by the
                Provisionals. However, even if it were true, it would be
                irrelevant. During the period of the Cold War, many people
                protested against nuclear weapons. The fact that those weapons
                were silent did not make them any less of a threat. It is the
                same with the illegal stockpiles of weaponry held by the IRA.
                The usual excuse of silent guns will come as a surprise to the
                RUC officers who came under automatic fire in north Belfast
                recently. It will also come as a surprise to the families of
                those who suffered IRA punishment shootings. The real human
                rights abusers are those who shoot or beat young people tried by
                a kangaroo court. Yet there is a deafening silence from senior
                Sinn Féin Members, including their Ministers. Strangely they
                are not so reticent when they suspect Loyalists or the security
                forces of wrongdoing.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The schizophrenia that characterises
                Republicanism is, therefore, alive and well today. At the Sinn
                Féin party conference 10 days ago, Gerry Kelly said that he
                knew all three Colombian &quot;tourists&quot; — that is
                strange. When they were arrested, Sinn Féin was at pains to say
                that those men were not party members and that no one, even
                those who had appeared on platforms with them at previous
                gatherings, seemed to know who they were. Gerry Adams had to be
                told by the Cuban Government that Niall Connolly was his party’s
                representative in Cuba and Latin America — that is
                questionable. I wonder how many other representatives about whom
                he knows nothing are out there? No doubt, they and Mr Adams are
                as elusive as a wet fish.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition, let us not forget the Florida
                gunrunning plot. At the time of the incident, the IRA said that
                it was not responsible, yet those who were convicted are now
                listed as Republican prisoners alongside the killers of Garda
                Gerry McCabe. In the dark world of Sinn Féin/IRA, evil is good,
                murder is justifiable, and the truth, like other people’s
                lives, is a cheap commodity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recently, the president of Sinn Féin claimed
                that terrorism is ethically indefensible. Where has Gerry Adams
                been for the past 30 years? The dead and wounded of Bloody
                Friday, Claudy, Birmingham, La Mon, Harrods, Enniskillen or
                Canary Wharf could have told him that a long time ago. The
                victims of those attacks, which were all on civilian targets,
                would have little difficulty in identifying those responsible as
                terrorists rather than freedom fighters. How dare the
                perpetrators of these outrages on civilians send condolences to
                the American victims of terror? Links to ETA, the Palestine
                Liberation Organisation (PLO), Libya and now the Revolutionary
                Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) are well documented.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The problem for Sinn Féin/IRA is that the
                truth hurts. It has told so many lies and generated so much
                propaganda that it believes its own publicity. It cannot accept
                the fact that the IRA is a terrorist group, because it cannot
                face the awful truth of what it has done to this country and its
                people over the past 30 years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us look at what it has done: it has
                bombed the centres of cities and towns; destroyed the economy;
                frightened off outside investment; created unemployment;
                murdered the forces of law and order; and murdered and maimed
                innocent people, Protestant and Catholic. Despite this, it has
                the effrontery to talk about human rights, jobs and equality.
                That is blatant hypocrisy, and with full intent to deceive the
                uninitiated.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Footage of IRA funerals shows that leading
                Sinn Féin members play key roles in those events, and some
                might even say that they organised them. The prime example must
                be the funeral of Thomas Begley, the mass-murderer of innocent
                shoppers on the Shankill Road. Was Mr Adams not a pallbearer
                that day? In response to the cry &quot;Bring back the IRA&quot;,
                a certain gentleman felt confident enough to reply, &quot;They
                haven’t gone away, you know&quot;. How could he speak with
                such authority?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The same individual now issues thinly veiled
                threats to those Nationalists who are tempted to join the Police
                Service of Northern Ireland. It appears that it is acceptable
                for Sinn Féin MLAs to be in the pay of the British state by
                virtue of their Stormont seats, but not so for young Catholics
                who want a job serving all the people of Northern Ireland as
                part of the police force.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is, therefore, time to call a halt to the
                gut-wrenching hypocrisy of Sinn Féin/IRA. This process has
                given it a chance to leave behind its past and to build for
                itself a democratic future. It is not the fault of democrats
                that the IRA is still wedded to the path of fascist armed
                struggle. Democrats should not be expected to indulge the IRA
                any longer, and they should not be punished for the failure of
                fascists. We have been patient and have gone beyond the extra
                mile in an attempt to secure peace, while others have not
                budged. Time and time again we have jumped.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">David Trimble, with tremendous courage, has
                taken great political and personal risks to sustain the process.
                No one could have done more, and I pay tribute to his skills,
                resilience, dedication and responsibility. However, the
                responsibility for the present crisis lies with the Sinn
                Féin/IRA Republican movement as a whole. It alone has failed to
                fully implement the Good Friday Agreement. Having listened to
                Sinn Féin today, I know of no spectacle more offensive and more
                ridiculous than the Republican movement in many fits of
                pretentious morality. I support the motion.</p>

                Cuireadh an rún seo chun tosaigh ag iarChéad-Aire a sháraigh
                níos mó ná uair amháin go neamhnáireach Gealltanas Oifige

                do chruinnithe earnála na Comhairle Aireachta Thuaidh/Theas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion brought by the former First
                Minister relies on section 30, subsection 2(a) of the Northern
                Ireland Act 1998. He seeks to exclude members of Sinn Féin from
                holding ministerial office, and when one of them rises to speak,
                he leaves the Chamber.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My party’s commitment to non-violence and
                exclusively peaceful and democratic means is unequivocal.
                Therefore, the motion has no rational basis. It represents no
                more than a smokescreen for subsequent action aimed at
                collapsing the institutions. What we are dealing with here is
                the outworking of Mr Trimble’s wrecker’s charter as set out
                in his letter to fellow Unionists a year ago, when he outlined
                his intention to see a crisis in the Assembly, achieve
                suspension of the institutions and place the blame on
                Republicans.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It would appear that Mr Trimble is opposed to
                change. His motion will fail. He may, however, succeed in again
                provoking the suspension, or even the collapse, of the
                institutions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Section 30 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998
                allows for the exclusion from office of any Minister on the
                basis of a failure on his or her part to observe any of the
                terms of the Pledge of Office. These terms include a pledge to
                discharge in good faith all the duties of office. They include a
                pledge to serve all of the people equally and to act in
                accordance with the general obligations in Government to promote
                equality and prevent discrimination.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let me remind Members also that the code of
                conduct, which Ministers must abide by, requires Ministers to
                operate at all times in a way conducive to promoting good
                community relations and equality of treatment. Furthermore, in
                the declaration of support for the agreement, participants
                commit themselves to partnership, equality and mutual respect as
                the basis of relationships in the North of Ireland, between
                North and South, and between these islands.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is ironic, therefore, that we are debating
                a motion put forward by a former First Minister, who in his
                period of office was in clear and flagrant breach of the
                agreement’s Pledge of Office on a number of counts — its
                code of conduct, its declaration of support, and the Northern
                Ireland Act 1998. In his period of office as First Minister, the
                courts found that he acted unlawfully in refusing to make
                nominations to the North/South Ministerial Council’s sectoral
                meetings.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is also ironic and a little hypocritical
                that Mr Trimble informs us of his intention to bring the motion
                challenging my party’s commitment to non-violence and
                exclusively democratic means yet tells us in almost the same
                breath that when his motion fails, as it clearly will, he will
                withdraw his party colleagues from the Executive and bring about
                the collapse of the institutions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It would appear that Mr Trimble’s own
                commitment to democratic means extends only to the point at
                which he ceases to get his way. Mr Trimble announced his
                intention to put his motion to the Assembly and, at the same
                time, threatened to take action to bring down the political
                institutions if his motion does not get the endorsement that he
                seeks. It does not seem to matter to Mr Trimble that over 70% of
                the people who participated in the referendums, North and South,
                voted in favour of the full operation of the institutions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Against a background of overwhelming support,
                North and South, for the agreement and the institutions, Mr
                Trimble has provoked the suspension of the operation of these
                institutions three times. He has fractured the operation of the
                North/South Ministerial Council and blocked sectoral meetings of
                that Council on education, and health and food safety. His
                actions have led to the postponement of further plenary meetings
                of the Council, and he has impeded proper ministerial
                consideration of work on accident and emergency services,
                emergency planning, high technology equipment, cancer research
                and health promotion. He has impeded the operation of the Food
                Safety Promotion Board at a time when food safety is so crucial
                to people across the island of Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Trimble has threatened to withdraw his
                party’s Ministers from the Executive to render unworkable the
                remaining political institutions and to bring about a further
                suspension or collapse. No one should underestimate what the
                effect will be if Mr Trimble is allowed to continue with his
                wrecker’s charter. Many of those who voted for the
                institutions did so in the belief that an Executive comprising
                local Ministers could and would benefit their lives in the way
                that we have committed ourselves to doing in the Programme for
                Government. They voted in the belief that if we are to catch up
                with the rest of Europe on the delivery and quality of services
                — health and social services, in particular — we stand a
                much better chance of doing so with an Executive of local
                Ministers and a local Assembly than under direct rule, which
                presided over the rundown of those same services in the past.</p>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most importantly, the Good Friday Agreement
                offered a historic opportunity for a new beginning, a fresh
                start for everyone in society. It gave all Unionists the
                opportunity to see myself, as Minister of Health, Social
                Services and Public Safety, and my party Colleague, Martin
                McGuinness, as Minister of Education, impact positively on their
                lives. That is beginning to happen. The agreement gave
                Nationalists the opportunity to see Unionists carry out their
                offices for the benefit of all and act without holding on to
                power for themselves and without excluding others. That we still
                await.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those who refuse to take up the challenges
                place at risk the opportunity to make the agreement a success.
                It is little wonder that people now ask me whether the prospect
                of success might be precisely what motivates or agitates Mr
                Trimble. I am asked whether it is Mr Trimble who is becoming
                increasingly nervous as Nationalist Ministers, and others, show
                evidence of their commitment to serve everyone equally. People
                also wonder whether Mr Trimble has the same difficulty, or even
                greater difficulty, with Sinn Féin and SDLP Ministers’
                placing equality at the heart of Government as he has with
                accepting the democratically expressed wishes across the island
                of Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The logic of seeking to move from the
                conflict of the past to a new and peaceful future is to realise
                that to overcome the hurt of the past requires dialogue and
                co-operation. The key to conflict resolution is a resolve to
                avoid using the process to gain short-term political advantages
                over old adversaries. Dialogue, negotiation and implementation
                of agreements already reached cannot and must not be reduced to
                political manoeuvring. We who are partaking in a transition
                process need to convince our supporters that co-operation rather
                than confrontation is the way forward. To undermine those who
                seek an alternative way is to risk a mood swing against the
                whole process. That would benefit no one.</p>

                Irish Governments and the political parties. The two Governments
                published a paper on 14 July 2001 which set out in detail the
                progress made on the implementation of the agreement and on
                aspects that were within the responsibility of the devolved

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although there is no review of the Parades
                Commission, it is true that, in a statement in August 2001, the
                Government said that to create greater consenus on the parades
                issue and a less contentious environment, they would initiate a
                review of the operation of the Parades Commission and the
                legislation under which it was established. The Government’s
                statement also indicated that the review would involve
                consultation with interested parties, including the Irish
                Government. On that basis, it appears logical for this

                Do the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister agree that
                the Executive should encourage the Prime Minister to proceed

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If there is a review, it is essential that
                not only the Executive but the entire Assembly be consulted. A
                significant number of consequential problems arise because of
                the failure to have the matter addressed, and they cause
                disruption to the devolved services. Therefore, as the
                representative institution of the people of Northern Ireland,
                the Assembly should be asked for its opinion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is evident that the commission is not
                achieving consensus in our community. There is still widespread
                disagreement over contentious parades, even though they are a
                small proportion of the number of parades that take place in any
                year. Nevertheless, it is clearly a contentious issue, and it
                has not been resolved by the actions of the current Parades
                Commission. That is why I am pleased to note that, in their
                submission in August, the Government indicated that they would
                initiate a review of the operation and the legislative basis
                under which the commission was established. That is the key to

                a review is unnecessary, given that the Parades Commission has
                done a good job, in the main, in determining contentious parades
                in an independent and dispassionate manner? It has also taken
                controversial decision making away from the police, providing a
                neutral environment in which parades can take place.</p>

                being dealt with satisfactorily is mistaken. The process was
                supposed to bring about consensus in local circumstances and
                avoid controversy. That patently has not been the case. We have
                endured several contentious decisions that have not received
                support from various sections of the community — it is not a

                question of waiting lists, given that the problem appears to be
                getting worse, although there is ample hospital capacity in
                other European countries?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In essence, the Member’s question is a
                matter for the departmental Minister. However, we have had long
                discussions about waiting lists and about the problems facing
                the elderly in our communities. Unless more money can be found
                for those services, the problems will continue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the previous Question Time, I expressed
                the hope that there would be a robust approach to the issue
                during Assembly debates on the Programme for Government and the
                Budget — and in the relevant Committees — to ensure that
                resources are available to give the aged and those in immediate
                need of acute services the attention that is their due. It is an
                important issue. If the Assembly is still here, this matter will
                be its acid test. I hope that it will show the robustness that
                is required.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Statistics can prove anything, but let us
                have the statistics. I can confirm that the Assembly’s first
                Budget in December 2000 provided an additional £114 million
                over the existing planned expenditure for the Department of
                Health, Social Services and Public Safety in 2001-02. The
                Department’s budget for 2001-02 is 5·3% higher than
                expenditure in the previous financial year, compared to an
                estimated 9·4% increase for the equivalent services in England.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In September, the Executive agreed a draft
                Budget for 2002-03 that will provide a further £31 million over
                indicative plans, representing an 8·1% increase over plans for
                the current year. No comparable information is available for
                Britain. Despite those statistics, there is still not enough
                money for the type of services that the Member asked about.</p>

                take up ministerial office, they have refused to participate in

                Ministers, the Executive have ensured that matters are
                progressed, even in the absence of ministerial co-operation, so
                that the people of Northern Ireland are not disadvantaged by
                their absence. The allocation of £40 million for the

                funding of free travel for the elderly are but two examples of
                such action. Nevertheless, people will inevitably draw their own
                conclusions. The two Ministers will, no doubt, claim credit for
                the actions of the Executive while trying to undermine its

                politics and the Departments suffer. The wider community depends
                on good government, and it is being short-changed. The Member

                of the present building. The Peace II programme that I referred
                to in my initial answer was not signed off by the European
                Commission until June 2001. Therefore it was not possible to
                submit a formal application for bids until October 2001. My
                Department is fully involved in the process. It is encouraging
                Translink to submit applications at the earliest opportunity. I
                hope that significant progress can be made and that, in the
                not-too-distant future, we will successfully obtain the
                resources needed for a new bus station in Downpatrick.</p>

                with Sustrans, the transport charity, on the development of the
                national cycle network in Northern Ireland. The first phase of
                the network, known as the millennium routes, is now
                substantially complete and comprises 527 miles of cycle network,
                both on-road and off-road. The Roads Service will continue to
                assist Sustrans as it seeks funding for the second phase of the
                national cycle network. That phase will include the provision of
                a proposed further 350 miles of cycle lanes which will extend
                the network to a number of rural towns. In the meantime, in
                conjunction with district councils, and in support of the
                Department’s transportation objectives, the Roads Service is
                seeking to improve cycle usage by focusing on the development of
                urban cycle networks in a number of towns across Northern

                we recently opened the cycle/footbridge in Coleraine, which has
                proved to be very successful. Sustrans is very supportive of the

                from Armagh to Coleraine via Dungannon and Cookstown, the A29.
                The western division of the Roads Service is carrying out
                several minor capital schemes on the route between Dungannon and
                Swatragh. Some further minor schemes are programmed on the same

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The section of the route from Newry to

                process planned for the Roads Service’s 10-year
                forward-planning schedule. The chief executive of the Roads
                Service will write soon to Members to detail schemes to be
                considered for inclusion. Several schemes on that link corridor,
                which include a Dungannon bypass, will be included in the list
                of schemes to be considered. I hope that Members will remember
                that I have said &quot;to be considered&quot;. In the past, when
                things were being considered, Members often assumed that they
                were being done. In the meantime, I assure you that the Roads
                Service is committed to maintaining the road structure and the
                running surface of the Newry to Dungannon route and will

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In recent years my Department’s Roads
                Service has completed a number of major road schemes to enhance
                the roads infrastructure in the west of the Province. Most
                notably, these schemes have included the A5 Omagh throughpass,
                stages 2 and 2B, the A509 Aghalane Bridge, the A5 Leckpatrick
                scheme and the A5 Magheramason scheme. The Roads Service also
                has plans to undertake a significant number of further major
                roads schemes in the west of the Province in future years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As far as public transport in the west of the
                Province is concerned, my Department’s rural transport fund
                supports 14 rural bus routes and 11 rural community transport
                partnerships. These services are in addition to the normal
                Ulsterbus services that run throughout Northern Ireland. My
                Department is currently preparing a draft 10-year regional
                transportation strategy for Northern Ireland. It will set out
                the longer-term strategy for the delivery of transport policy
                throughout Northern Ireland and provide a strategic framework
                within which funding decisions on investment in roads and public
                transport can be taken.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The strategy will fully recognise the
                importance of accessibility in rural areas and in particular the
                significant structural maintenance backlog on minor roads in
                rural areas. The draft strategy is due for completion in the
                autumn.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister mentioned the A5 in the Omagh
                area, but I am particularly interested in the A4, and much work
                has been done there. The ‘Shaping our Future’ document shows
                the regional transportation infrastructure to mean minimal
                transport development west of the Bann.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was amused to hear that a bypass for
                Dungannon is being considered, although there was no mention of
                a bypass for Moy on the A29. It is a notorious bottleneck, and I
                hope that a feasibility study will be done to alleviate pressure
                on that particular part. I welcome the Minister’s transport
                policy, and I want to know what has been done about the A29 Moy
                bypass.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will try to cover roads, public transport
                and the regional transportation strategy. Mrs Carson raises two
                specific issues — the Moy bypass and the A4. Several schemes
                are included in the Road Service’s construction programme and
                the major works preparation poll, and I have mentioned some of
                them. The improvements to the A4 at Eglish and Cabragh are
                further good examples. I will respond to the Member in writing
                regarding proposals for the Moy bypass and the A4.</p>

                on the matter of bypasses for Cookstown and Magherafelt if we
                are to have a proper, appropriate and successful transport
                infrastructure in the west of the Province? They are needed
                urgently, as that is a major route to the sea and the airport
                and thus vital to the economy of west of the Province.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The short answer is yes. There are several
                towns in Northern Ireland about which I have received
                significant representations regarding bypasses, and each of them
                must be judged on its merits. I do not underestimate the
                importance of the towns that Dr McCrea mentioned. However, the
                difficulty lies in the resource implications for each of them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members will be aware of the continuous
                representations that have been made to me about more than a
                dozen areas, all of which are in need of bypasses. Members will
                also be aware of the criticism that the Department receives when
                a bypass has been agreed. However, we will proceed nonetheless.
                I do not in any way underestimate the economic implications for
                Cookstown and Magherafelt.</p>

                I welcome the Minister’s answer, particularly regarding the
                Eglish roundabout and Cabragh. Does he accept that in the past
                the transport infrastructure was severely underfunded in the
                constituencies in the west, and can he guarantee that he will
                skew resources in order to make our roads safer, in line with
                roads in the rest of the Six Counties?</p>

                with some authority on the implications for resources that have
                been allocated since I became a Minister.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Finance and Personnel, when
                he announced his draft Budget for 2002-03 on 25 September, spoke
                of additional money being allocated to the roads programme. Some
                £8·79 million of that is to maintain current levels of
                investment in the country’s roads infrastructure. The increase
                is essentially to avoid reductions in planned service throughout
                Northern Ireland, including West Tyrone, that would otherwise
                have been necessary because of additional costs, including the
                effects of the aggregates tax. For example, it will allow the
                Roads Service to start work on the Strabane bypass next year,
                following completion of the statutory procedures. I am also
                aware of the importance of routes such as the western A5 and the
                south-western A4, which are key transport corridors to West
                Tyrone. As I indicated in my recent letter to Members, the Roads
                Service has identified a number of major works on key corridors
                for possible inclusion in the 10-year forward planning schedule.</p>

                beyond his constituency. Subject to the successful completion of
                the necessary statutory procedures, and the availability of
                funds, it is hoped to start work on a number of schemes — and
                the Omagh throughpass is among them — in early 2003. The cost

                is vital to an area such as West Tyrone, which is solely
                dependent on a road network for all its transport needs? Does he
                accept that the accumulated roads maintenance backlog has had a
                detrimental effect on the condition of those roads? Does he
                accept that it is very difficult to attract inward investment or
                promote more locally based economic development, given that a
                40-tonne lorry cannot travel above 40 miles per hour anywhere in

                and take note, that economic development can be hindered as a
                result of the infrastructure not being provided. We come back to
                the chestnut of sufficient funds being available to provide that

                Department is currently considering three major planning
                applications for approximately 1,100 dwellings and associated
                facilities on green belt lands in the Carryduff area. The demand

                Undoubtedly, there is great demand. To ensure that balanced and

                Radioactivity and the liquid effluent would contribute about one
                ten thousandth of 1% of the total activity discharged from the
                site in liquid form. At these levels, it is expected that the
                most exposed members of the public would receive around 0·002
                microsieverts per year from the operation of the MOX plant. At
                this rate, DEFRA estimates that it would take 10,000 years to
                get the same exposure as in a single chest X-ray.</p>

                very dangerous radioactive material up and down the Irish Sea.
                It is a matter of concern for this island and many other islands

                due to exposure to radon at home, and 12% is as a result of
                medical exposure. Nuclear discharges account for less than
                0·1%. In the assessments, which are carried out periodically,

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Northern Ireland Waste Management
                Strategy was published by my Department in March 2000. Its main
                aim is to achieve sustainable waste management through the
                reduction, re-cycling and recovery of waste. A key requirement
                for the strategy is the development by district councils of
                waste management plans, showing how they propose to meet the
                targets in the strategy and provide the strategic network of
                waste management facilities that will be needed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The strategy set a deadline of the end of
                June 2001 for the submission to my Department of final draft
                plans following public consultation. All three council
                partnership groups submitted draft plans to my Department before
                the end of June. However, these were pre-consultation rather
                than final drafts.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My officials have recently met with
                representatives of the three groups and provided information to
                assist them to finalise the draft plans for public consultation.
                My Department has also provided a workshop to assist councils to
                identify the best practicable environmental option in their
                plans.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Completion of those plans and the
                establishment of the physical infrastructure needed to meet the
                strategy’s objectives and targets will be central to its
                success.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of the Environment recently

                concerned with planning policies for the development of waste
                management facilities. The Department has also funded a further
                study of waste arisings in Northern Ireland. The results will
                assist councils in making their decisions on waste management.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An important part of the machinery to deliver
                the strategy was the establishment of the Waste Management
                Advisory Board. The board held its inaugural meeting on 6 June
                2001. I am confident that it will play a key role in the
                guiding, monitoring and progression of the strategy.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some councils did not make representations to
                the Department of the Environment until June 2001, and the
                Department received only consultative documents rather than
                draft plans. That held back the Department. There was £3·5
                million set aside, but the Department had to return £1 million.
                However, I assure the Member that that does not mean that the
                Department will treat the issue any less seriously.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department hopes to push the education
                plans when the other plans go out, because if one issue is put
                in front of another it is forgotten about and it loses its
                impact. That is why the education plans are not running now.

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The EU Commission’s proposals for a sixth
                Environment Action Programme, first circulated to Members for
                comment last January, will soon go before the European
                Parliament for Second Reading. Therefore, it is likely to be
                some time before the content of the programme is finalised. The
                UK is broadly supportive of the Commission’s proposals, and I
                have endorsed that line.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The programme includes a more vigorous
                approach to implementing existing environmental policy,
                integrating environmental objectives into social and economic
                policies and developing more sustainable production and
                consumption patterns. That approach would undoubtedly provide
                challenges for Northern Ireland as well as for other parts of
                the UK and other member states.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, much of what the Executive have
                initiated on the environment since devolution means that
                Northern Ireland should be well placed to respond to those
                challenges. That includes the commitments to sustainable
                development and environmental protection set out in the
                Programme for Government as well as the substantial increases in
                resources provided for environmental protection in the Budgets
                for 2001-02 and 2002-03. The proposals in the sixth programme
                identify a number of priority action areas at European level.
                Those largely coincide with environmental priorities on both GB
                and Northern Ireland levels.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Environment Action Programme identifies
                five key approaches, one of which is to integrate environmental
                concerns into all relevant policy areas. How does the Minister
                envisage his Department integrating those environmental concerns
                into the relevant policy areas?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Environment Action Programme seeks to
                deepen the integration further. In order to effect that, in the
                next few weeks a consultation paper will be published on a draft
                sustainable development strategy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The consultation paper will seek views on the
                implementation framework for sustainable development.
                Simultaneously, that will achieve the four objectives of
                sustainable development: social progress, which recognises the
                needs for everyone; effective protection of the environment;
                prudent use of natural resources; and maintenance of high and
                stable levels of economic growth and employment. In this way
                environmental objectives will be integrated with social and
                economic gains. I assure the Member that the consultation paper
                will look at those issues and that the Department will await
                representations.</p>

                Department has responsibility for zoning land to provide for
                housing growth anticipated by the regional development strategy.
                The Minister for Social Development advises me that increasingly
                developers recognise the commercial potential of providing new
                housing development within co-ownership price levels, and that
                in redevelopment areas houses are being set aside for
                co-ownership in a drive to promote sustainable mixed tenure
                estates. The regional development strategy recently published by
                the Department for Regional Development sets as policy a
                requirement to provide a housing choice by achieving a mix of
                housing tenures and house types, to promote home ownership and
                generally affordable housing and to provide social housing
                targeted to meet identified housing needs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The strategy sets targets for achieving
                brownfield housing development through the development plan
                process. At my specific request — and progress is monitored
                against those targets — account will be taken of the need for
                the planning system to make provision for affordable housing
                particularly, but not exclusively, for first-time buyers and
                those on lower incomes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to quality, in June 2001 the
                Department published planning policy statement 7: ‘Quality

                planning policies for achieving quality in new residential
                developments and advises on the treatment of that issue in
                development plans.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In many areas in Northern Ireland, the
                problem of second home owners has resulted in a situation in
                which there is no settled community. School numbers are in
                decline and church numbers have dropped. In one area in my
                constituency, over 70% of homes are empty for approximately 42
                weeks of the year. As a result, shops have closed, and the post
                office no longer exists. Is the Minister content that his
                efforts will overturn this situation? If so, how long does he

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am aware of Ms Armitage’s concerns about
                second homes in her constituency. The demand is great at the
                moment, and it is not easy to contend with. The recently
                published regional development strategy indicates that, in
                future, development plans will identify settlements and areas
                under pressure from second homes. The development plans will
                deliver a set of criteria which allow for evaluation, in
                consultation with local residents, of the capacity of a small
                town or village to absorb new second home development. The
                development plan process will take account of such matters as
                scale, character and setting. Consideration can be given if
                local planning policies are needed and an assessment made if
                there is a need to zone additional lands to ensure local supply
                of affordable housing.</p>

                taken by the Department to make it an offence to build without

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Department’s policy on the promotion of
                recycling of waste is set out in the waste management strategy
                for Northern Ireland, published in March 2000. One of the aims
                of the strategy is to move waste management practices towards
                increased reuse, recycling and recovery for all waste streams,
                including household and industrial waste. The strategy sets out
                challenging targets for recovery and recycling, and for
                reductions in the quantity of industrial and commercial waste
                and biodegradable municipal waste going to landfill. District
                councils are working to finalise comprehensive waste management
                plans. One of the aims of these plans is to ensure that there
                are adequate facilities for the recycling and recovery of waste
                to meet the targets set out in the strategy. These draft plans
                will be subject to public consultation. In order to help promote
                an informed public debate my Department will mount public
                awareness and education campaigns, which will highlight the need
                for recycling. These campaigns will run in parallel with the

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The main barriers to the expansion of

                Provisional IRA to offer up its illegal weaponry for
                destruction; the Republican Movement’s continuing terrorist
                threat, and active pursuit, of terrorist outrages to secure its

                terrorist activity in Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland
                and across the globe; the fact that the Provisional IRA is
                inextricably linked to Sinn Féin; and the involvement and

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Robinson:</p>
                </font></b><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the first few hours of this debate, I
                noted that several Members spoke in acrimonious tones. The word
                &quot;hypocrisy&quot; seemed to feature in everyone’s speech.
                I look at this debate more positively than some who have spoken.
                I welcome Mr Trimble and the Ulster Unionist Party to this
                debate on the exclusion motion. My Colleagues are well used to
                such things — they have been through them on several
                occasions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the first occasion, Ulster Unionist Party
                Members decided to lock themselves in their Glengall Street
                office. The whiff of the debate might have been too strong for
                them. On the second occasion, they ventured into Stormont
                although they locked themselves in their rooms. Therefore, it is
                real progress to have them here for an exclusion debate. As Mr
                Mallon said, they used to consider such a debate to be a stunt;
                Mr Trimble now sees it as a clever tactical move, replete with
                moral efficacy, and that must be progress for Unionism.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are those who say that it is
                hypocritical of Mr Trimble to withdraw his Ministers, or to
                contemplate doing so, having chided the Democratic Unionist
                Party for many months, if not years, for taking up what he
                described as an unacceptable position. I recall that when Nigel
                Dodds and I first went into ministerial office, he referred to
                us as rogue Ministers. Members may say that that is hypocritical
                of Mr Trimble, but I see it as progress. Just because someone
                got it wrong in the past, it does not mean that he must get it
                wrong in the future. I welcome the fact that he has taken the
                DUP line on exclusion and withdrawal. He may want to take it a
                step further and recognise that immediate resignations are
                required.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are also those who consider a joint
                Ulster Unionist/PUP motion to be hypocritical. How, they argue,
                can the UUP table a motion to exclude IRA/Sinn Féin while in
                harness with the PUP? Well, it gives us an opportunity to vote
                twice for the exclusion of IRA/Sinn Fein, and we should not miss
                any opportunity to exclude terrorists from Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The main issue is the exclusion from the
                Government of Northern Ireland of a terrorist group still wedded
                to active terrorism. It is not a new issue for debate — there
                are no new factors. In the debate on 18 September, I outlined in
                detail the breaches of the so-called ceasefire and the
                contraventions of the principle of exclusive commitment to
                peaceful and democratic means. I showed that the Provisional IRA
                had carried out 170 punishment shootings during the period of
                its so-called ceasefire. On top of that, I said that it had been
                involved in 250 paramilitary beatings, in robberies, in
                excluding people from Northern Ireland, in gunrunning from
                Florida, in training and in equipping itself with new expertise
                in bomb warfare in the jungles of Colombia, as well as multiple
                murders. The IRA has murdered Jim Guiney, Robert Dougan, Brendan
                Campbell, Andrew Kearney, Eamon Collins, Brendan Fegan, Paul
                Downey, Charles Bennett, Joe O’Connor, Christopher O’Kane
                and Paul Daly. That organisation is on ceasefire and is supposed
                to be committed to exclusively peaceful and democratic means.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have had the hypocrisy — there is that
                word again, Mr Deputy Speaker — of the leader of IRA/Sinn
                Féin saying in the Assembly today that no reason had been given
                for excluding it from Government. Are not those names good
                reasons why it should be excluded from Government? IRA/Sinn
                Féin is still tied in to active terrorism and has not given it
                up. As Mr Adams said himself, the IRA &quot;has not gone away,
                you know.&quot; It is not necessary to argue too much of a case
                that the Provisional IRA, with its political wing, Sinn Féin,
                is in breach of any requirement to be committed to peaceful and
                democratic means. It has used its weaponry to extract
                concessions and intends to continue to do so.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have had the nauseating spectacle of Sinn
                Féin/ IRA’s attempt to dissociate itself from terrorism
                because, today, there is an acceptance throughout the world that
                those who are involved in terrorism should be shunned. IRA/Sinn
                Féin attempts to distance itself by saying that there is some
                distinction to be drawn between the violence that it was engaged
                in and the violence that we saw in New York and Washington.
                Indeed, at the Sinn Féin conference, the Member for North
                Belfast said that the IRA was not a terrorist organisation:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;When I went to war against the British
                because they were at war with the occupied section of my people,
                I didn’t think it was immoral. On the contrary, I thought we
                had a moral right. But I have no hesitation in condemning what
                happened in America because hijackers took civilians in
                aeroplanes and crashed into other innocent people in the towers
                and the Pentagon. Those were quite obviously acts of
                terrorism.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He cannot condemn the bombing of the World
                Trade Centre out of one side of his mouth and then decree that
                virtue and merit should be ascribed to the bombing of Canary
                Wharf, the City of London, Enniskillen, La Mon or any of the
                other acts of terrorism in which the IRA has been engaged. The
                leader of IRA/Sinn Féin suggests that the heroes of Enniskillen
                and La Mon are brave men. The world rightly condemns terrorism,
                of which the IRA is an integral part.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The road is running out for the IRA. The
                world has changed since 11 September, and its members know it.
                They will now consider trying to placate world opinion by some
                token act of decommissioning. The two dumps with their obsolete
                weaponry have already been compromised. Perhaps they will
                consider concreting over them. That will not satisfy Unionist
                public opinion, nor will it satisfy world opinion. To be
                meaningful and credible, decommissioning must be complete and
                publicly verifiable. Moreover, it will necessitate a programme
                for dismantling the IRA’s paramilitary machine, which in every
                aspect is still active.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The SDLP has coasted through the debate by
                telling the Ulster Unionists, Sinn Féin and the DUP that they
                are wrong, without focusing on its own behaviour. The SDLP could
                keep the Assembly operating, but I know that it will instead
                maintain its link with IRA/Sinn Féin. Like the Taliban in
                Afghanistan, it will not give the terrorists up. However, the
                SDLP must choose between Taliban tactics or side with those who
                will not accept terrorist rule.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Prime Minister, Mr Blair, and President
                Bush, at the start of the present campaign, which affects the
                whole world, said that they would invite nations to choose to be
                with or against the terrorists. They asked &quot;Whose side are
                you on?&quot; Today, in Northern Ireland, the same question is
                posed in this Chamber. When we go into the Lobbies, we will see
                who votes for the terrorists and who votes against them.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Farren:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are debating a motion that should never
                have come before the House. Those of us who signed the Good
                Friday Agreement recognised that it required more than
                signatures to end conflict and to facilitate the development of
                new political partnerships. Mutual trust remained to be built,
                not just by working the new institutions but by delivering on
                all the confidence-building measures prescribed by the
                agreement, including decommissioning. Mutual trust is clearly
                not yet sufficiently present among all the pro-agreement
                parties, and especially not between Sinn Féin and the Ulster
                Unionist Party. Until it is, the agreement’s promise will be
                only fitfully realised and its very continuation endangered.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Removing the only context in which the
                agreement can submit considerably increases the risk of its
                collapse. For 30 years, Sinn Féin supported the IRA’s
                campaign of violence. Thousands of its victims were from the
                Protestant, Unionist community. The need for Sinn Féin and the
                whole Provisional movement to build confidence in its commitment
                to the Good Friday Agreement was therefore an inescapable and
                profound challenge. Building that confidence had to mean more
                than participation — no matter how enthusiastic and committed
                — in the institutions alongside Unionist representatives.
                Participation accompanied by mere promises on decommissioning
                does not generate sufficient confidence that the IRA really
                intends to put its arms permanently beyond use. I accept that
                the inspection of arms dumps has not been unhelpful, but
                promises to the international commission have not been followed
                through by practical steps towards putting arms permanently and
                verifiably beyond use.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Do the IRA and Sinn Féin not see that a
                minimalist and apparently reluctant approach to decommissioning
                is seriously undermining pro-agreement Unionist confidence in
                Sinn Féin’s commitment to the agreement? It is also, perhaps,
                undermining the agreement itself. I cannot believe that they do
                not see that. To judge by some things that were said and by some
                things that were done, I am forced to believe that some of them
                do not care. It is a strange position for a movement that claims
                that its ultimate objective is to unite the people of the
                island.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is not just Unionist confidence that Sinn
                Féin and the IRA are required to encourage. The wider
                Nationalist family in Ireland, which also suffered greatly
                during the 30 years, from IRA and Loyalist violence, and which
                overwhelmingly opposed politically motivated violence is just as
                entitled to know whether the Provisional movement is fully
                committed to exclusively peaceful and democratic means.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As much as anyone who has been involved in
                politics in Northern Ireland, I recognised that putting 30 years
                of violence behind us was never going to be easy or swift, no
                matter how widespread the support. People in both communities
                needed convincing both by their own leaders’ words and by the
                words and deeds of leaders in the other community. Resolute
                action to have all aspects of the agreement gradually
                implemented in parallel was required. A willingness to take
                account of each other’s difficulties, as well as one’s own,
                was required. Perhaps, Martin McGuinness’s words at his party’s
                Ard-Fheis last week about how Unionist concerns need attention
                can be welcomed as a shift in that direction.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The UUP and other Unionists, just as much as
                Sinn Féin, should have realised the need to take others’
                difficulties and perceptions into account. Prevarication in the
                early months of the Assembly over the Executive and the
                North/South Ministerial Council and, more recently, sanctions
                against Ministers’ attendance at North/South meetings have
                raised doubts about the depth of their commitment to the
                political process and the Good Friday Agreement. Loyalist
                paramilitaries claiming to support the agreement should also
                have realised and acted on the requirements to build trust, just
                as much as the IRA. Their re-engagement in violence has been
                even greater than the IRA’s, and it has stretched the meaning
                of being on ceasefire beyond belief. Is the PUP’s support for
                the exclusion motion to be taken as a signal that the Loyalist
                paramilitaries who are associated with that party are, at last,
                prepared to commence actual decommissioning? If so, the PUP’s
                support for the motion, in one sense, can be taken as a welcome
                signal. If not, the sincerity of its support for the motion is
                seriously open to question.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I recognise that the UUP agreed to enter the
                Executive — not once, but twice — following IRA promises on
                decommissioning. As a result, together with Ministers from my
                party and Sinn Féin, UUP Ministers have demonstrated what can
                be done for the people of Northern Ireland when we combine our
                political resources. Last week, I addressed the House with Sir
                Reg Empey on the threats hanging over hundreds of workers in the
                aerospace industry. This week, I am due to engage with Sir Reg
                and Mr Morrow on the economic development of west Belfast and
                the Shankill. I am engaged with Ministers de Brún and
                McGuinness in dealing with drugs and alcohol abuse, especially
                among the young. I make those points to illustrate the positive
                work that the Executive and the Assembly are doing. We should
                work together to address the problems that affect all the people
                of Northern Ireland. However, to sustain our efforts, we need
                more trust and confidence between pro-agreement parties.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are on the brink of another of those
                critical moments that have plagued the implementation of the
                Good Friday Agreement. The SDLP remains convinced that the
                agreement, with all its checks and balances — constitutional
                and political — together with its human rights, policing and
                justice agendas is the only basis upon which lasting peace and
                stability can be achieved. What is needed, even at this late
                stage, is a political breathing space that would help to cement
                the agreement. That would strengthen, not lose or endanger, the
                emerging partnerships. Through their past actions and their
                intentions over the next few days, the Unionist leadership,
                together with Sinn Féin, are denying the process the space that
                it requires.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Leslie:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As someone who has supported the agreement
                through thick and thin, I know a bit about taking political
                risks. I take no pleasure from the fact that we find ourselves
                forced to table this motion. However, I see no alternative. I
                remind the House that the mechanism that is reflected in our
                motion was envisaged in the agreement and, therefore, in the
                Northern Ireland Act 1998.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There were — and still are — three things
                that the Republican movement could do to demonstrate its good
                faith in the implementation of the agreement: decommissioning;
                saying that what it calls &quot;the war&quot; is over; and
                ending the violence. Curiously, ending the violence perhaps
                receives the least attention. Although it appears from the
                evidence of recent years that the Republican movement has given
                up fighting the Army and the police — a contest in which it
                could never get more than a draw — it has certainly not given
                up terrorising its own community; nor have certain Loyalist
                elements. When it suits them, Republicans and Loyalists
                terrorise the interface to make one side stir up the other.
                Nowhere would an end to violence be more welcome than in those
                paramilitary fiefdoms. Unfortunately, those fiefdoms seem to
                have expanded over the past five or six years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Republican intimidation and terror
                machine was at its most visible during the recent election
                campaign. In ‘The Irish News’ on 5 June 2001, Ms Rodgers,
                who was the SDLP candidate in West Tyrone, said that she had
                received a warm reception from most people in West Tyrone, but
                that</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;there are some Sinn Féin supporters
                who are engaged in a sinister and systematic campaign of abuse
                and intimidation against me and my election workers&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is a disgraceful situation in a
                democracy. When that election was over, Ms Rodgers said that she
                did not want to make a fuss. Had that intimidation come from
                part of the Unionist community, we would still be hearing the
                fuss. There is no doubt that it suits Sinn Féin to undermine
                the electoral process, but it does nothing but harm to the SDLP
                and the institutions that are elected through that process. I
                sometimes wonder whether the SDLP is really the voice of
                moderate Nationalism — the voice of the community that is
                having to live under the jackboot of nightly terrorism from the
                Republican machine.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For clear language on the subject, I turn
                south of the border to Mr Quinn, the leader of the Irish Labour
                Party, who made some pertinent comments at his party conference.
                He said that</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;To be a Republican is to believe in the
                sovereignty of the people. But these people are not true
                Republicans. For three years, they have refused to comply with
                the mandate explicitly voted for by the people of the whole
                island, north and south. That mandate was to put arms beyond
                use.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He went on to say:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;it’s time… to stop peddling the
                lie, that the putting of arms beyond use is some kind of British
                or Unionist diktat. It is a direct order from the Irish people,
                no more and no less.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On occasion, we hear similar language from Mr
                Mallon. I have a question for Mr Mallon and his party. If a
                direct order of this kind is disobeyed, what action follows the
                words? Mr Bush and Mr Blair made direct demands of the Taliban
                regime. When they were not obeyed, that regime got the answer
                — in fact, just the beginning of the answer — yesterday. It
                is just as well for the IRA and the Irish Republic that we are
                dealing with this issue entirely through the constitutional
                mechanisms available to us, and not by more drastic means.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The SDLP could have won considerable
                political advantage by distinguishing itself from Sinn Féin. A
                consistently robust attitude towards intimidation by the IRA and
                towards its failure to decommission would be an obvious way to
                express that distinction, and I am surprised that the SDLP
                rarely seems to adopt such an attitude. The SDLP could also
                point out that terrorism has contributed nothing towards the
                realisation of the dream of a united Ireland. Indeed, it has
                made that possibility more remote than ever. Those are powerful
                arguments but for some reason, they are not being properly made.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The d’Hondt system was used to form the
                Executive. The system was not designed for that purpose; it was
                designed for use in the formation of Committees. The d’Hondt
                system, when used in the formation of an Executive, creates an
                unusual and distorted system of government. It was employed
                mainly to accommodate the Republican movement. If Republicans
                are not going to fulfil their obligations on decommissioning and
                non-violence, there is no need to persist with those
                distortions. That, however, does not mean moving away from an
                inclusive system of government. It means drawing a distinction
                between a fully inclusive system that includes terrorist
                organisations and an inclusive system that does not include
                those terrorist organisations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The appointments to the Policing Board have
                already created a precedent for that situation, and I warmly
                welcome the SDLP’s appointments to that board. I believe — I
                suspect that the SDLP believes — that, in due course, Sinn
                Féin will make appointments to the board. I would like to
                believe that, in due course, Sinn Féin will do what is
                necessary for its representatives to become bona fide members of
                the Executive. However, as Mr Attwood said a few weeks ago,
                without some use of the stick, how are we going to persuade Sinn
                Féin to do that? The precedent of the Policing Board shows the
                correct course to follow as we seek decommissioning and
                non-violence. In the interim, a price must be paid by those who
                do not comply with the will of the vast majority of the people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Ulster Unionist Party wants to work in an
                inclusive system, and we find it offensive to be accused of
                having any degree of equivocation on that score. My Colleagues
                and I have worked assiduously in every part, and through every
                mechanism, of the Assembly to demonstrate our commitment to
                inclusiveness. We have worked companionably and constructively
                with all parties, and we have shared information and ideas with
                a view to providing good and fair governance for all the people
                of Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has been said that the IRA will not do
                anything under pressure. It certainly does not do anything when
                it is not under pressure. Each time proper pressure is applied,
                we start to see some sort of movement in the Republican machine.
                Once again, we must apply pressure. The routine is becoming
                wearisome, but that is what we must do. Otherwise, we will
                continue to have a situation in which paramilitaries decide what
                peace is and in which the Provos say that there will be no peace
                if they have to give up their guns.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must ask again what sort of society we
                want to live in. Is it to be a society that recognises and
                values diversity, and in which equality means equality of
                respect and opportunity, and freedom means the ability to live
                in peace with others? Or is it to be a society based on ideas
                peddled by the Republican movement, in which diversity is seen
                as a threat, the only law is Provo law, equality means joint
                authority and freedom has been perverted to mean a hatred of all
                things British?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is the sort of society in which all too
                many people find themselves living in a climate of fear in those
                Republican ghettos.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1998, the people of Northern Ireland and
                the Republic of Ireland decided which road they wished to
                travel. The Republican movement is still standing at the
                crossroads, where we should leave it while it dithers about its
                next step forward. We should proceed without the Republican
                movement.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh míle maith agat, a LeasCheann
                Comhairle. Whatever the purpose of the motion, I have no doubt
                that it has little or nothing to do with achieving that which it
                purports to seek. In fact, the movers of both motions know that
                none of this will result in Sinn Féin’s expulsion from the
                Executive. The more that the Ulster Unionist Party protests that
                its motivation to collapse the political institutions is to
                force the IRA into an act of decommissioning, the more obvious
                its real intentions become.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Ulster Unionist Party now differs only
                tactically from the DUP and from those Unionist paramilitaries
                engaged in daily gun and bomb attacks. In fact, today’s motion
                is part and parcel of a deeply rooted resistance within Unionism
                to political change and to the effective delivery of the
                equality agenda. We saw that at the time of the referendum on
                the Good Friday Agreement when almost 50% of Unionism voted to
                reject the peace process. We see that every day in the
                despicable blockade of schoolchildren on the Ardoyne Road.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I listened with disbelief as Mr Trimble and
                other Unionist spokespersons attempted to rationalise the
                reality of naked Unionist bigotry and sectarianism. A recent
                enduring image was created when Mr Trimble walked into the
                negotiations in September 1997 — in what he termed a show of
                Unionist unity — shoulder to shoulder with the political
                representatives of the UDA, the UFF, the Red Hand Defenders and
                the UVF. On entering Castle Buildings, David Trimble asserted
                that they would not negotiate with Sinn Féin but would achieve
                my party’s expulsion. He did not succeed then, and he will not
                succeed now. Four years later, David Trimble is still fascinated
                and fixated by Sinn Féin; four years later, his authority and
                his ability to lead his community and his party is eroded.
                However, he still clings to the failed and foolish notion that
                to exclude the largest non-Unionist party in the North will
                somehow solve Unionism’s problems.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am obliged to point out that Sinn Féin
                represents more than 21% of the electorate — one in five of
                the people who live here. I must ask whether that is the
                democratic commitment of those who would seek to exclude that
                community. The threat to the Ulster Unionist Party comes from
                within Unionism, not from Republicanism. The Ulster Unionist
                Party leader has delayed implementation. He has been prepared to
                repeatedly break the law and to use public moneys to pursue his
                futile and unsuccessful legal defence of his party political
                actions. David Trimble has carried letters of resignation in his
                pocket. Finally, he resigned from the Executive — how ironic.
                I wonder has it even occurred to him that one of the
                consequences of his foolish brinkmanship is that he finds
                himself in the very position that he has sought to impose on
                Martin McGuinness and Bairbre de Brún. He is the one who is
                outside the Executive. That would be funny were not it so
                serious.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Instead of putting those sad experiences
                behind him, it seems that the Ulster Unionist Party leader is
                intent on repeating his mistakes by waltzing out of these
                institutions — once again hand in hand with Dr Paisley and
                supported yet again by the PUP. However, there is a certain
                consistency to David Trimble. It is not only his relationship
                with Dr Paisley that has been opportunistic, hypocritical and
                ambivalent, Mr Trimble’s on-off relationship with violent
                Unionism goes back to his Vanguard days, and specifically to his
                role as legal adviser to the UDA-led Ulster workers’ strike in
                1974. Indeed, Mr Trimble, we can all have a past as well as a
                future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That ambivalence was again evident when he
                could not reach an accommodation with Dr Paisley in his quest
                for signatures for today’s motion. Who did David Trimble, the
                crusader for decommissioning, turn to for support? He turned to
                none other than the political representatives of the
                non-decommissioned UVF. That is not so surprising when you
                recognise that Unionism’s real agenda is not at all about
                decommissioning. Were that his genuine objective, the leadership
                of Unionism had the opportunity to demonstrate authority and
                vision in early August when John de Chastelain, in strict
                accordance with the Good Friday Agreement, reported that he had
                successfully negotiated a formula to put IRA weapons beyond use.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was presented on a plate, largely because
                Sinn Féin had used its influence on behalf of the peace
                process, but Unionism could not find the courage to respond
                positively. I was disappointed to note today that neither Seamus
                Mallon nor Sean Farren availed of the opportunity to defend the
                initiative on IRA weapons and did not defend the agreed
                mechanisms of the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, at the time, neither did the Irish
                or the British Governments. Even now, such validation would be
                very helpful. Unionism’s real agenda is to stall the change
                that is already in train and to slow the progression towards a
                society that is built on equality. It matters not to the
                opponents of change how peacefully that objective is pursued.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ulster Unionism’s consistency has been its
                persistent opposition to change, but if Unionism believes that
                it can prevent change, it is sadly mistaken. If Unionism
                believes that it can return to the days of untrammelled power,
                it is even more mistaken. And if Unionism believes that it can
                deny Sinn Féin’s electoral authority as the representatives
                of the majority of Nationalist and Republican people in the
                North, it is absolutely and fundamentally mistaken.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sinn Féin is committed to resolving all of
                the issues between us by entirely peaceful and democratic means
                — all problems, including the issue of weapons. I am pleased
                to have the opportunity to reiterate that today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I urge those Unionists who do accept that
                there is a need for change to accept the hand of friendship that
                Sinn Féin offers and to join us in managing that change, so
                that it will be peaceful and beneficial to all of the people of
                Ireland, regardless of their religious or political persuasion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I respond to a point raised by Dr Paisley in
                his contribution: contrary to his assertions — and it would be
                helpful if he would check the facts — there were no
                representatives of either ETA or the Puerto Rican organisations
                at our party conference. They neither attended, nor were they
                invited to attend. It is important that the record reflect the
                facts.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Collective elected leadership is the
                responsibility of us all. We are the representatives of our
                divided society. We represent the diversity of our society. We
                can self- determine in the Assembly to make politics work and to
                deal with the issues that have sustained conflict and division
                for generations, or we can self-determine not to do that. But
                what happens then? Go raibh míle maith agat.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As my Colleagues have already indicated, the
                SDLP will support neither exclusion motion. We will oppose both,
                just as we have opposed all previous exclusion motions. The SDLP’s
                position in regard to exclusion motions has not changed; the
                position of the party opposite has.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I understand the frustrations that are
                expressed in the Chamber today, and outside of it, regarding the
                failure to achieve decommissioning. We do not join with Sinn
                Féin in dismissing those concerns, and we are not playing games
                of &quot;now you see it, now you do not&quot;. In other words,
                we will not address a party conference saying that there are
                legitimate Unionist concerns and then march in here and rubbish
                the very legitimate Unionist concerns that have been expressed
                — concerns that are well rooted in the agreement itself.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is three and a half years since the Good
                Friday Agreement. It is time that we achieved decommissioning
                — not only by Republicans, but by all paramilitary groups.
                That was the promise of the agreement. People voted for the
                agreement with the prospect that along with the inclusive
                political institutions we would have decommissioning.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I reject those who insist that
                decommissioning is a red herring, or that it is a rejectionist
                ruse. For several years we have heard Sinn Féin’s claims that
                decommissioning was not a requirement of the agreement in the
                first place; that the insistence upon decommissioning was a
                figment of Unionist rejectionism. Because I reject that, I
                welcome what Martin McGuinness said at the Sinn Féin Ard-Fheis:
                the party seemed to recognise that there are legitimate Unionist
                interests in respect of decommissioning.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those legitimate requirements in respect of
                decommissioning do not attach or belong to Unionism alone,
                inside this Chamber or in the community at large. We need to
                achieve decommissioning not only in the interests of the wider
                community, but to meet the democratic requirements of the
                country.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Trimble spoke earlier about wanting to
                preserve the agreement and these arrangements. The SDLP wants to
                work with all other parties, not just in preserving the
                agreement but in developing it and the operation of all its
                institutions to their fullest possible potential. It is
                precisely because we want to protect the agreement that the SDLP
                has not supported exclusion motions in the past and will not
                support exclusion motions today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In doing that, I want to nail Peter Robinson’s
                misrepresentation that somehow we will be simply voting with
                Sinn Féin. [Interruption].</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The DUP went through the Lobbies with Sinn
                Féin against that amendment. So, who voted with Sinn Féin in
                relation to the decommissioning issue in the Chamber a few weeks
                ago? Mr Peter Robinson need not think that he can throw up some
                sort of asides against the SDLP.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us be clear. If we are going to preserve
                these arrangements, we must make more progress. The institutions
                have worked well. In all the recrimination that might break out
                in the Chamber, let us not forget that together we have operated
                these institutions and these arrangements well. All parties in
                the Chamber have operated Committees well; all parties in the
                Executive have contributed to better governance in this part of
                the world. All parties that have participated, and that have
                been allowed to participate, at any level in the North/ South
                arrangements have made effective contributions to improving
                co-operation on this island.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The irony is that the institutions are now
                threatened, not because of any inherent failures in the them,
                not because of an inability of parties in the Chamber or
                elsewhere in the arrangements to work together, but because of
                difficulties in other areas of the agreement. We must make those
                good. The best way to concentrate on making good those
                outstanding issues elsewhere in the agreement is not by
                collapsing the institutions. I do not see how we get to the
                fuller implementation of the agreement by jeopardising such
                implementation as we already have by playing a game of chicken
                with the institutions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Just as the SDLP opposes exclusion, it also
                clearly opposes the evasion that has passed for the Republican
                response to the issue of decommissioning.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have already welcomed the remarks that
                Martin McGuinness made at the Sinn Féin Ard-Fheis. However,
                contrast them with what I think was Mitchel McLaughlin’s
                second reaction to events in New York. In one contribution he
                actually said that seeing aeroplanes used in that way to attack
                people shows the nonsense of decommissioning; if things can be
                used in that way, then weapons are not the issue. That amounted
                to equating some of our issues with violence with the violence
                in New York, contrary to the rest of the Sinn Féin spin on that
                issue.</p>

                other’s comments appears to be a stock-in-trade on all sides
                of the House — nobody is particularly guilty of it. While
                Members may want to clarify matters, I cannot take matters of
                that kind as points of order on which I can rule.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McLaughlin seems to think that I was
                referring to a particular TV programme. I said it was about his
                second contribution. It was not in the TV programme that he was
                referring to. He will find that the quote was carried in several
                media sources at the time, and not actually repudiated.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since New York, Sinn Féin has tried to say
                that that was terrorism and that anything that has happened here
                is not terrorism. We have heard language about things being
                &quot;ethically indefensible&quot;. Members across the Chamber
                have said, and I agree, that there is no ethical difference
                between the violence in New York and the violence that has been
                carried out here in the name of various paramilitary groupings.
                We cannot accept or see the ethical difference.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People might see an empirical difference as
                far as those paramilitary groupings are concerned now. The
                empirical distinction that might be made that could give people
                some confidence and basis of self-respect for continuing to take
                the risks that they have with this process would be if progress
                was achieved on decommissioning — not more commitments made,
                only to be withdrawn. It would be terrible if the Republican
                movement, having made further commitments in recent weeks to
                engage intensively with Gen de Chastelain, were to try to use
                the excuse of crass Unionist tactics — in particular,
                recruiting the two signatures for the motion from the PUP, with
                all of its associations — as the latest excuse for not doing
                anything about decommissioning.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We hear a lot about the &quot;securocrats&quot;.
                We have also suffered in this process at the hands of the &quot;obdurocrats&quot;
                in the various paramilitary organisations who will not move.
                They insist that they will determine the pace at which the
                process moves on, that they will determine that various things
                have to be done as bargaining chips to achieve decommissioning.
                I take the point that was made earlier by Sinn Féin Members,
                but let us remember that that bargaining-chip process has been
                going on at an inverted level on the part of Republicans as
                well.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need to make sure that we can move forward
                with this agreement and the institutions intact. We can only do
                that if we are able to believe that this dispensation gives us
                all hope of a new inclusive basis for working together. The best
                way to create the belief that people have changed their ways
                over past violence is for them to give up the means.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the debate on the two motions. I
                also welcome the fact that on this occasion there is a good
                turnout — particularly on the Ulster Unionist Benches. When
                this was previously debated, I think that only Mr Kennedy was
                present to speak and vote. The change and the progress that has
                been made away from negative language such as
                &quot;stunts&quot;, &quot;political opportunism&quot; and
                &quot;waste of time&quot; has to be welcomed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Unionist community will welcome the fact
                that there is a unity of purpose among Unionists in the Chamber
                today in taking on Sinn Féin/IRA and attempting to put them out
                of the Executive. Many of us wish that it had come earlier.
                Belated as it is, we welcome it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also welcome the fact that the leader of
                the Ulster Unionist Party has indicated that he is prepared to
                withdraw his Ministers and that he is going to have them resign,
                or dismiss them. Although that too could have come sooner, it is
                welcome. Many of the arguments that we are debating this evening
                have been rehearsed here before. The situation has not changed:
                there has been no decommissioning, and there was no
                decommissioning when we debated the issues in the past.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If it is right now that IRA/Sinn Féin should
                not be in the Government of Northern Ireland, it was right in
                May 2000, because exactly the same situation pertained then as
                does now. It was right in November 1999, when the decision was
                taken — wrongly — to put IRA/Sinn Féin into the Government
                in the first place. All the damage that has been done to the
                democratic process, and the corruption of that process, could
                have been avoided, had those wrong, misguided decisions not been
                taken by the leader of the Ulster Unionist Party.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have made progress, and more parties now
                support the motion. However, it would be very welcome if the
                Prime Minister, who was very strong, and rightly so, in his
                denunciation of terrorism on the international stage were also
                to open up a new front against terrorism in his own backyard. He
                should join with the political parties who are trying to rid the
                Government of Northern Ireland of those who still remain totally
                wedded to the use of the Armalite in one hand and the ballot box
                in the other.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There will be no use in standing up in the
                House of Commons later tonight to decry the fact that
                Governments across the world are providing safe havens and cover
                for terrorists when in part of the United Kingdom there are
                members of a political party and a Republican movement, which is
                still wedded to violence, who are at the heart of Government.
                They control half the Budget of this region of the United
                Kingdom. There are double standards, and Mr Blair should face up
                to that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other Members have clearly, and at some
                length, detailed why Sinn Féin has a case to answer. It seems
                that each time those issues are highlighted — whether it be
                the Colombian holiday adventure of three leading Republicans, or
                today’s debate — so that the spotlight is turned on the
                murderous activities of the Republican movement, the stock reply
                is that Sinn Féin has no case to answer.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a very strong case to answer. There
                have been 30 murders since 1994. Guns have been used, beatings
                have been carried out, and there has been racketeering and
                intimidation. There has been a summer of violence, much of
                which, as the Chief Constable made clear, was orchestrated by
                the IRA. We had the Florida gunrunning episode, during which it
                was made clear that at the highest levels the Republican
                movement was involved in the plan to import armaments from the
                United States. Sinn Féin’s liaison with the narco-terrorists,
                the drug dealers of Colombia, has also been very clearly
                exposed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The nauseating distinction, already pointed
                out by my Colleague Peter Robinson, made by some in the
                Republican movement who label the terrorism of 11 September as
                unacceptable and claim that they were not engaged as terrorists,
                but as freedom fighters in a struggle for liberation, is also
                hypocritical. That hypocrisy will not be lost on the relatives
                and loved ones of those who they turned into human bombs, or
                left orphaned, and for whom they have not one word of remorse,
                regret or apology. Rather, they try to justify their war and
                their terrorism.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have listened to Mr Mallon lament the fact
                that in two weeks’ time there may not be an Assembly. Of
                course, that is very much down to how he and his Colleagues vote
                today. Will they decide to back the terrorist frontmen, or will
                they vote with the democrats to put the frontmen out of
                Government? That is their choice.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I listened to the argument that to exclude
                Sinn Féin would not be in keeping with the provisions of the
                agreement. The agreement and the legislation that flowed from it
                include explicit provisions for the exclusion of parties.
                Therefore, a vote to exclude parties would carry out what is
                included in the Act and, therefore, what flows from the
                agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To answer all the talk about full and early
                implementation of the agreement, why not use one of the
                provisions in the legislation that was designed to exclude
                parties that are not committed to exclusively democratic means?
                The SDLP’s decision to vote along with Sinn Féin/IRA is not
                based on any desire to protect the agreement; it is a decision
                to protect its own party. The SDLP should have learned by now.
                Mr Durkan, in his first speech in the House as leader elect of
                the SDLP, does not seem to have learned anything from the past
                four or five years. He should have learned that by going down
                the same road with Sinn Féin/IRA and by refusing to take it on,
                he is encouraging its greater electoral success.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I remind Mr Durkan — and he should consult
                Hansard — that on Tuesday 18 September, when it is clear that
                the SDLP amendment weakened the import and thrust of the DUP
                motion proposed by Peter Robinson, the SDLP called for the
                decommissioning of IRA weapons and the DUP supported that. He
                should, therefore, correct the comments he made earlier.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have also listened to the argument that the
                only way to achieve decommissioning is to persist with the
                approach of including Sinn Féin/IRA in Government and to
                continue to offer the carrot rather than the stick, and that
                nothing will be achieved by coming down hard. The carrot has
                been dangled in front of Sinn Féin/IRA for the past two to
                three years. We were told initially that unless it got into
                Government, it could not be expected to decommission. We were
                then told that it was not in Government long enough to prove to
                its troops on the ground that it was worth persevering. It has
                now been in Government for almost two years, during which time
                it has continued to engage in murder — and still it will not
                decommission. It is long past the time to use a bit of stick. It
                must either be the handover of weapons or expulsion from the
                Government of Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There was much coverage in the weekend
                newspapers about a move on IRA decommissioning, and on such
                occasions we have become used to the IRA/Sinn Féin leadership
                coming forward with a gesture designed to put itself on the high
                moral ground, so to speak, in propaganda terms. Let me make it
                clear that the concreting over of two redundant compromised arms
                dumps will not fool anybody in Northern Ireland. We were told by
                Members on both sides of the House that decommissioning would
                have to be completed by May 2000. We are still waiting for
                decommissioning to begin, and gestures and stunts will not work
                and will fool nobody.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a basic flaw in the agreement, and
                while the motion may not succeed because it does not have
                cross-community support, let it be remembered that as a result
                of the vote tonight, the continued presence of Sinn Féin/IRA in
                Government does not enjoy cross- community support. It
                invalidates its presence in Government just as much as it may
                claim that the vote is invalidated by lack of cross-community
                support. It applies both ways.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There must be a fundamental review of the
                agreement. Let us stand on the side of democrats, reject
                terrorism and vote for these motions.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr M McGuinness:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, this has been a long and difficult
                journey for all Members, including Sinn Féin Members. It has
                been a difficult journey for the Ulster Unionist Party, the SDLP,
                many of the smaller parties and, of course, the DUP. Against all
                the odds, we reached an agreement on Good Friday 1998.
                Undoubtedly, that was, and will remain, a very significant date
                in the history of this island.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was an interesting experience. I found the
                journey to the large room in Castle Buildings interesting; it
                was a hive of activity and a lot of excitement. People came
                together from all political parties, and the political
                representatives of those parties took their positions at the
                table.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.00 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At that time, the leader of the Ulster
                Unionist Party, David Trimble, whom I watched carefully, said
                that he was in favour of the Good Friday Agreement. I could see
                that it was painful for him to sign up to it. When it later
                became clear that the British Prime Minister had effectively
                handed him a side letter on decommissioning, I knew that we were
                in trouble and that the Good Friday Agreement was in big
                trouble. I also knew that decommissioning, contrary to what some
                Members said, would be used to prevent the implementation of the
                agreement and that it would be a big problem for Sinn Féin in
                the political process.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When Jeffrey Donaldson walked out of the
                peace talks, it became clear that some Ulster Unionist Party
                members were not prepared to face up to the change that the Good
                Friday Agreement heralded. Ever since that day, the Ulster
                Unionist Party has tried to deal with its internal
                contradictions over the agreement. The Ulster Unionist Party has
                tried to ride two horses. It stated publicly that it was a
                pro-agreement party, but at the same time it caved in to people
                such as Jeffrey Donaldson, David Burnside and others who were
                opposed to the agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I listened to Robert McCartney pooh-poohing
                the notion that Fenians were not wanted about the place. I have
                also heard senior members of the Ulster Unionist Party state on
                television in the North of Ireland since Good Friday 1998 that
                they were opposed to the Good Friday Agreement because they were
                opposed to power sharing. They believe that there should be
                majority rule, and that is what the DUP believes. The DUP is not
                a pro-agreement party; it is opposed to the Good Friday
                Agreement lock, stock, and barrel. It does not want a Fenian
                about the place. Not only does it not want a Fenian of the Sinn
                Féin variety, it does not even want one of the SDLP variety.
                Boxcar Willie, Peter the Punt, Papa Doc — none of them wants a
                Fenian about the place. That has posed a huge challenge to Sinn
                Féin.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the recent years, Sinn Féin has tried to
                deal with the need to implement the Good Friday Agreement fully
                and to get all the political parties who said that they were
                pro-agreement to put their shoulder to the wheel to get the
                agreement implemented in full. That has been a difficult task,
                particularly given the Ulster Unionist Party’s decision that
                it would emasculate the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Peter Mandelson changed the rules on flags to
                satisfy the Ulster Unionists. The British Government caved in to
                the Ulster Unionists on the policing issue; they were not alone
                in that. At an early stage, the British Government caved in to
                Unionist attempts to rewrite the section of the Good Friday
                Agreement that deals with decommissioning and how it should be
                handled; they were not alone on that either.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This morning I listened to the leader of the
                Ulster Unionist Party taking Members on a legalistic journey for
                about 15 minutes. Many Members wondered where it was all
                leading. Not once during those 15 minutes, when he tried to
                state the legal case in defence of his exclusion of Bairbre de
                Brún and myself from the North/South Ministerial Council, did
                he acknowledge that he had twice been found to be acting
                illegally by a court in Belfast. Of course, the British
                Government have not said a word about it — <i>[Interruption.]</p>
                </i><b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order. Will Members check that any
                communication equipment that they have is either switched off or
                on vibrate mode, so that Members can continue the debate
                uninterrupted by pagers or phones.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr M McGuinness:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was interesting to hear the leader of the
                Ulster Unionist Party say that he had no doubt about the
                commitment of the PUP to use only peaceful and democratic means.
                I say that while freely acknowledging that David Ervine and
                Billy Hutchinson have been two of the most positive contributors
                to the peace process over recent years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Only 12 months ago, members of the UDA and
                UVF were killing one another on the Shankill Road, yet David
                Trimble sought the support of a party associated with what
                happened then. Responsibility for what happened on the Shankill
                Road lay mostly with the UDA, because of its anti-agreement
                stance.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">David Trimble made another important
                statement. He said that decommissioning was important as an
                indicator of future intent. With due respect, I have never heard
                such rubbish. It took someone on the Unionist Benches, a short
                time later, to point out that the LVF had indeed decommissioned
                some time ago, yet it was the LVF who killed Rosemary Nelson and
                the LVF who recently killed Martin O’Hagan. That is the
                reality.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The hullabaloo about decommissioning has not
                gone down well in the Nationalist/Republican community. People
                watched in amazement as the issue was elevated over the rest of
                the agreement, despite 250 pipe bomb attacks on the Nationalist
                community throughout the North. Yesterday, at the Davitt’s
                Club in Swatragh, County Derry, a child lifted a pipe bomb, and
                we never heard a word about it. Condemnations are dragged out in
                television interviews.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We see despicable scenes in north Belfast,
                with little children walking to school with spittle running down
                their faces. I was there several days ago and was told by
                people, with immaculate credentials, that the protesters at
                Glenbryn held pornographic photographs of women up to parents of
                the children as they walked into the school. Who was with the
                protesters that morning and afternoon? Nigel Dodds, the MP for
                the area, was there with them.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dodds:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Speaker. It is
                entirely wrong and outrageous for this IRA commander, members of
                whose organisation went into a hospital and shot through
                incubators, such is its regard for children, to stand there and
                tell barefaced lies about what happened.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order. The Member knows very well, from here
                and from elsewhere, the language that should be used in the
                Chamber. Therefore in response to his point of order, I put back
                a point of order.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr M McGuinness:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am satisfied with the accuracy of the
                information that I received on that matter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I said that it had been a difficult journey.
                There are good and decent people in the Ulster Unionist Party,
                as there are undoubtedly good and decent people in the Unionist
                community who voted to endorse the Good Friday Agreement three
                years ago. It is important that we try to build bridges and work
                together. For 18 months, we have worked together in the
                Executive. We have worked well with the SDLP and the Ulster
                Unionist Ministers at Executive meetings. The public would be
                pleased to see the way in which their elected representatives
                approach the work that goes on at those meetings on health,
                education, agriculture, the environment, the economy and many
                other matters.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People continually ask where Sinn Féin
                stands in relation to the Unionist community and Unionist
                political leaders who say that they are in favour of the Good
                Friday Agreement. We value the contribution made by those
                people. Unionists must also take on board the strong opinions in
                the Nationalist community about the way in which they have
                messed about in the past three years, while we tried to
                implement the Good Friday Agreement. I am sure that everyone
                heard my Ard-Fheis speech. In it, I acknowledged that some
                Unionists feel strongly about decommissioning. Some Unionists
                also feel that the issue can be used to prevent change and
                political progress. It is important that Sinn Féin deals with
                the concerns of those whom we believe are serious about the
                search for peace on this island. Without contradicting Mark
                Durkan, I stress that I am not retracting what I said in that
                speech. I am saying that the decommissioning issue must be dealt
                with and that all political parties have a responsibility to do
                their part to make it happen. Where do I stand? If
                decommissioning were to happen tomorrow morning, I would be as
                pleased as Punch. It is my job and that of all pro-agreement
                political parties and the two Governments to try to make it
                happen. We must create the circumstances in which we can remove
                all the guns from Irish politics.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not accept that decommissioning is the
                reason for the current difficulties in the peace process and the
                institutions. It would be wrong of me to say that, because I do
                not believe it. We are in difficulty because Unionist political
                leaders of the anti-agreement variety — and even those who say
                they are pro-agreement — find it difficult to come to terms
                with the fact that Sinn Féin is growing in political strength
                in the North and all over the island of Ireland. The Westminster
                and local government election results came as a significant
                shock to the Unionist community. Sinn Féin representatives now
                chair Strabane, Omagh, Cookstown, Magherafelt, Dungannon and
                Newry and Armagh councils. We also have four Sinn Féin MPs.
                People are concerned about the fact that the combined votes of
                the SDLP and Sinn Féin amount to something that can no longer
                be ignored.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The days of second-class citizenship are
                over; the days of Nationalists and Republicans sitting at the
                back of the bus are over. Given the increasing confidence of the
                Nationalist and Republican community, the last thing we want is
                to be part of a political process that consigns any section of
                the community — be it Ulster Unionist, DUP or anyone else —
                to the position that we have endured since the partition of this
                island. Go raibh maith agat.</p>

                a misjudgement, we put the motion down with only my name on it.
                Then I discovered that I had to wind up, as well as propose the
                motion, otherwise I would have happily passed that duty on to
                someone else.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will try to refer to several of the
                speeches that were made. I ask Members whom I do not mention to
                accept my apologies. It is not that their contributions were
                unimportant, but time is limited, and I want to focus my
                comments on those things that are especially significant.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I start by congratulating Mr Ervine on his
                contribution, which was serious and honest. Every Member who
                listened to it will have been impressed by it. I found it
                curious that so many of the comments from other Unionists were
                not directed to the motion; they were not directed towards
                criticising Sinn Féin, although that is their position. The
                bulk of what they said criticised my Colleagues and me. I
                listened to Mr Cedric Wilson, who said nothing that was not an
                attack on me and my Colleagues. The kindest phrase to describe
                it would be &quot;a farrago of nonsense&quot;.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Speaker. The record
                will show that, once again, Mr Trimble has lost it.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Trimble:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am confident that the record will show the
                emphasis that Mr Wilson gave, and it will show that my comments
                were accurate. The same comments are true for 95% of the speech
                by Mr Wilson’s former leader, Mr McCartney. It is so nice to
                see both of them singing from the same hymn sheet again.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCartney:</p>

                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Trimble:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I cannot reply to that comment. The acoustics
                of the Chamber prevented my hearing it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I congratulate Dr Farren on his comments. In
                his opening line, he said that the motion, in a sense, should
                never have come before the House; he was right. If other people
                had kept their obligations and implemented the agreement in the
                way that they should have done, the motion would never have come
                before the House. It comes before the House only because of the
                failure of people to fulfil their obligations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several comments were made about recent court
                rulings. I will not go into details, but nearly all of them
                misunderstood the position. The court said that some of the
                reasons that I gave for my actions went outside the ambit of the
                Act, but it indicated that other reasons were within the ambit
                of the Act. I am acting wholly within the ambit of the Act and
                have been doing so. I have also been acting within the ambit of
                the existing judgements. If the party opposite does not believe
                that, let it go back to the court and challenge it again. It can
                go to the House of Lords and challenge the issue there. Then, we
                will see how things work out.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Reference was also made to the timing of the
                resignations of Ulster Unionist Members. All of those comments
                were wrong. The reason for our action is simply that we are not
                here to cause an abrupt disruption to the business of
                government, but to arrange for an orderly transfer of business
                to the relevant Northern Ireland Office Ministers when
                suspension comes. It is not another deadline — that was a
                fatuous comment. It is not to give the IRA another chance. It is
                not necessary. If suspension comes, people can decommission
                afterwards, and then there can be resumption; that is not a
                problem. The Members who made those comments were completely
                wrong.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The nature of decommissioning was also
                mentioned. We should remind ourselves of the simple. There is
                legislation. It contains a statutory definition. The definition
                states that decommissioning is a method by which weapons and
                other materials are made permanently unavailable and permanently
                unusable. If it is not permanent, it is not decommissioning.
                General de Chastelain, who is there to verify that
                decommissioning has taken place, will certify to that effect.
                Those are the basics. There may be discussion about the details,
                but no one can make any mistake about the basics. Those tests
                must be satisfied; otherwise decommissioning has not taken
                place. I suggest to those Members who are concerned about
                whether or not an act constitutes decommissioning that they
                remember the basic principles. They should wait and see and keep
                those principles in mind if and when something happens. I hope
                that something does happen, but if it does not, the consequence
                of that will lie elsewhere.</p>

                discrepancy between the requirements as set out by the former

                move forward in parallel and the expectation of the Republican

                before it will, for tactical reasons, make any move on
                decommissioning? Does he also agree that the objective of the
                entire exercise was that all parts of the agreement would move
                forward in parallel, and that, regardless of what anybody else

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My hon Friend is right. Indeed, he could have
                gone further and said that while the then Secretary of State
                made it clear that all elements should have moved together, it
                was that Secretary of State who failed to ensure that that
                happened and who consequently did much to bring about the
                present unsatisfactory situation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was interesting to hear a Member quote
                something that I said off the cuff three and a half years ago
                about having a past and a future. It seems to be going down in
                history. I have taken the trouble to locate the text of a speech
                that I made at the first sitting of the Assembly, because it is
                worth revisiting. If I may pat myself on the back, that speech
                was entirely extemporary. If certain Members check the record
                tomorrow, as they have been advised to by Mr C Wilson, they will
                find that they quoted my phrases inaccurately. It will be
                worthwhile if I take a little time to remind them of what I
                actually said. To set the context, I had been questioned about
                my party’s Assembly manifesto, which made references to
                &quot;unreconstructed terrorists&quot;. In response to that, I
                made the following comment:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;A number of Members who are here today
                have done terrible things.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That was simply a reference to the violence
                in which some had been involved in the past. I also said:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;I do not need to elaborate, though I
                should say that those concerned are not all in one corner of the
                Chamber.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That was a recognition that the violent and
                terrible things done in the past were not solely carried out by
                the Republican movement, but that other elements also have
                something to consider.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I then came to the point that has been
                misquoted today. I said that</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;We are not saying, and we have never
                said, that the fact that someone has a certain past means that
                he cannot have a future. We have always acknowledged that it is
                possible for people to change.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It must be noted that that does not mean that
                there is automatically a future — it depends on change. I then
                said:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Because of the situation in this
                society it is desirable that all Members with a terrible past
                should change and should demonstrate that they have
                changed.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I then described the process as an inclusive
                one. I continued:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;There is an opportunity for people to
                take part in the process if they have shown that they are
                committed to peaceful means and democracy. I underline these
                points not out of a desire to exclude but simply to emphasise
                the things that need to be done. The sooner there is a
                realisation of that need, the better.&quot; <i>— [Official
                Report, Bound Volume 1, p17].</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unfortunately, three and a half years later,
                there has not been a realisation of that need, and the change
                has not taken place in the way that it should have done.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan said that the SDLP had always
                opposed exclusion. That was not always the case. I remember
                when, in 1998, the then deputy leader of the SDLP gave a formal
                commitment to exclude. He said that</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;For many Unionists there is the fear
                that Sinn Féin seeks to pocket the maximum sectoral advantage
                from the agreement — membership of the Executive, prisoner
                releases, changes in policing, criminal law reform,
                demilitarisation, new equality legislation — and then will
                fail to honour their decommissioning obligations under the
                agreement within the specified two-year period.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Mallon then continued:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;I believe that this will not occur —
                and that it is not intended. But no one should have any doubt
                that if it did happen the SDLP would rigorously enforce the
                terms of the agreement and remove from office those who had so
                blatantly dishonoured their obligations.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those are his precise words.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member will recall that in that address
                to the SDLP Conference, Séamus Mallon made a twin offer: one
                that reflected and understood Unionists’ concerns and one that
                fully understood the natural suspicions that Sinn Féin had. We
                made a twin offer to both parties, an offer that was aimed at
                setting up the institutions in 1998. It was rejected by the
                Unionist party, and the institutions were not set up until a
                year later.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Trimble:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan is half correct. A twin offer was
                made, but the other half was not necessary because we did set up
                the institutions and included Sinn Féin in the Administration.
                I will not go back on it again.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan’s second point is not correct.
                There is no conditionality here. Mr Mallon said:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;I believe that this will not occur —
                and that it is not intended&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But it did occur. He also said that</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;no one should have any doubt that if it
                did happen the SDLP would rigorously enforce the terms&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has happened. Mr Durkan must therefore
                consider whether it is appropriate not to follow those
                principles through. If SDLP Members seek further advice on the
                matter, I refer them to yesterday’s ‘Sunday Independent’.
                I believe — I stand to be corrected — that the ‘Sunday
                Independent’ has the largest circulation of any daily or
                Sunday newspaper published in Ireland. I should frame yesterday’s
                editorial. It starts:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The Ulster Unionist leader’s move is
                inevitable and largely unavoidable. Mr Trimble’s decision to
                press for Sinn Fein’s removal reflects a crisis of public, and
                not merely unionist, confidence in both the intentions and
                actions of the republican movement in securing the
                decommissioning of paramilitary weapons.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It concludes:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;His move to secure the expulsion of
                Sinn Féin from the power-sharing Executive should not be seen
                as an act of revenge and frustration. It represents a final
                desperate move to save an Agreement that can only be worth
                saving if all who accepted its terms are willing to honour them
                in practice. Mr Trimble is right. That can only mean IRA
                decommissioning. And until it happens, Sinn Féin should have no
                place in government.&quot;</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is yesterday’s issue of the ‘Sunday

                its advice.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sinn Féin Members have lost the plot. They
                have been offered opportunity after opportunity that they have
                not taken. They seem to think that the game that they have been
                playing for the past three years can go on indefinitely; it
                cannot. Time and time again, we have given them opportunities.
                In dealing with the matters that they raised, the Government
                went much further than my Colleagues and I wished. Every point
                that they raised at Weston Park was dealt with sympathetically
                by the Government. What happened? There was silence in August
                — silence and inactivity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sinn Féin Members are determined to keep
                their heads down, hoping that somehow the problem will blow
                over. Consequently, this action is necessary to show them that
                it will not blow over. There is only one way now in which they
                can proceed, and the sooner that they summon up the courage to
                do so, the better. When they decommission — they probably
                will, eventually — they will demonstrate something extremely
                important: the war was wrong.</p>

                have been flawed; it might have needed changes. Those changes
                could have been made peacefully. The violence that Republicans
                engaged in made the situation worse. They spread more bitterness
                in the community; they slowed down positive changes that would
                otherwise have happened; they have achieved nothing but the
                deaths of 3,000 people; and they have left a dreadful legacy to
                this society. It is time that Republicans addressed the need to

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That in consequence of the failure of the
                Provisional IRA to offer up its illegal weaponry for
                destruction; the Republican Movement’s continuing terrorist
                threat, and active pursuit, of terrorist outrages to secure its
                aims; the maintenance by the IRA of an active terrorist
                organisation; the growing number of cases of IRA involvement in
                terrorist activity in Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland
                and across the globe; the fact that the Provisional IRA is
                inextricably linked to Sinn Féin; and the involvement and
                dominance of members of Sinn Féin in the decision-making
                &quot;Army Council&quot; of the Provisional IRA, this Assembly
                resolves that Sinn Féin does not enjoy its confidence because
                it is not committed to non-violence and exclusively peaceful
                means, and further, in accordance with Section 30 of the
                Northern Ireland Act 1998, determines that members of Sinn Féin
                shall be excluded from holding office as Ministers for a period
                of 12 months from the date of this resolution. —[Rev Dr Ian
