                1 July 1998 that reports be presented by the First and Deputy
                First Minister(s) (Designate) and by the Committee on Standing
                Orders by this date, I wrote to the Secretary of State advising
                her of the necessity for a sitting of the Assembly. I have
                received the following letter from Mr Paul Murphy, the Minister
                of State, on her behalf:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Thank you for your letter of 7
                September addressed to … [the Secretary of State], who, as you
                know, is presently on leave.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">By virtue of paragraph 1 of the Schedule to
                the Northern Ireland (Elections) Act 1998 it falls to the
                Secretary of State to determine where meetings of the Assembly
                shall be held, and when.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the light of your indication of the wishes
                of Assembly Members, the Secretary of State hereby directs that
                the Assembly shall meet at Parliament Buildings, Stormont at
                10.30&nbsp;am on Monday 14 September until 6.00 pm on Wednesday
                30&nbsp;September.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Secretary of State will consider making a
                further direction as respects this period, in particular in the
                light of any indications she receives as to the wishes of
                Assembly Members after the Assembly has begun to meet.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Before we proceed, it is only right for the
                Assembly to recognise that an extraordinary amount of work has
                been done by its staff, by various contractors and, indeed, by
                others outside. Members will know that some staff have worked
                exceptionally diligently, often over weekends and far into the
                night. By leave of the Assembly I ask that our appreciation be
                conveyed, through the Deputy Clerk, to all concerned.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Maskey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to address you as &quot;Cathaoirleach&quot;,
                which is the Irish for &quot;Chairperson&quot;.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, the British Secretary of State has, of
                course, designated Parliament Buildings as the location for the
                Assembly. We shall return to this matter in due course, for we
                have a number of concerns.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, the Agreement provides for and
                encourages the promotion of the Irish language, among others.
                Therefore the provision of simultaneous translation facilities
                is another matter to which we shall return in due course.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Initial Presiding Officer:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is for the Assembly to decide where to
                meet after what is described in the Northern Ireland (Elections)
                Act 1998 as the appointed day — the day on which power is
                devolved. The Assembly is entirely at liberty to have
                discussions and to make its own decisions. I wish simply,
                without prejudice, to express appreciation to those staff who
                have worked extremely hard to ensure that we are provided with
                facilities for the present.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The question of the Irish language and Ulster
                Scots was raised at the last sitting and in the interim. We have
                made arrangements for the transcription — translation could
                not be arranged at this stage — of Irish and Ulster Scots in
                the Official Report.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Civil Service trawl has not resulted in our
                obtaining competent transcribers, so we will have to advertise
                outside the Service. That matter is proceeding, but in the
                meantime appropriate arrangements have been made to ensure that
                Assembly business is properly recorded.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Simultaneous translation is an entirely
                different matter, which the Assembly will need to discuss later.
                I have not yet taken action in that regard.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr Ian Paisley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Can it be made clear to Members that if they
                choose to speak in a language not known by all Members, that
                will be included in their time? They cannot speak in a language
                unknown to some Members and then have additional time to speak
                in English.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Initial Presiding Officer:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am happy to repeat what I said previously
                and to affirm that what Dr&nbsp;Paisley says is correct. The
                amount of time that Members have is not altered by the language
                in which they speak. I have already requested that Members using
                a language other than English translate for the sake of other
                Members.</p>

                nGaeilge, go bhfuil an t-am ceannann céanna agamsa agus atá ag
                gach aon duine eile. Ach, má tá mé ag tabhairt aistriúcháin

                an aistriúchán sin a chur ar fáil.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If I or any other Member wishes to speak in
                Irish it is only right that we be given the same amount of time
                as someone speaking in any other language. If, for the benefit
                of other Members, in the absence of a translation system, I have
                to spend time saying in English what I have said in Irish, that
                time must be separate. If I am asked to provide such a service
                for Members who do not speak Irish, but am not given extra time
                to do so, I will not have the same speaking time as others.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Initial Presiding Officer:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I appreciate your view, but the decision as
                to what facilities are available still rests with the Secretary
                of State. It is not yet the decision of the Assembly. When the
                Assembly has power to make its own decisions — for example,
                when and how to meet — it can address this matter. When one
                speaks, it is not only for the benefit of one’s listeners but,
                given that one is trying to communicate with others, also for
                one’s own benefit to make oneself understood. Therefore
                translation is equally important to the person speaking and to
                those listening. Thus I appeal to Members to be courteous to
                each other by making themselves understandable.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The question Mrs&nbsp;de&nbsp;Brún raises
                is, in effect, that of simultaneous translation — something
                which will have to be debated by the Assembly. At this stage I
                have given the only ruling that I think proper.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr C Wilson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I believe that it is the view of the majority
                of Members that this is a huge waste of Assembly time and of
                taxpayers’ money. Everyone in this Chamber is perfectly
                capable of addressing Members in English and being understood
                fully. I have placed my concerns with you, Mr Presiding Officer,
                and the Business Committee and will continue to take that
                position.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wanted to draw attention to two issues to
                which we will return. Mr Wilson certainly does not speak on
                behalf of a majority of Members.</p>

                Hansard staff employed to transcribe Irish or Ulster-Scots will
                also be doing the normal editing in English. The Assembly will
                return to this matter. I wish simply to make a ruling until it
                can be considered more fully.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The best way to resolve the matter is for a
                translation service to be provided as soon as possible so that
                Members can speak in whatever language they choose. As has been
                said, the Agreement gives equality of esteem to both languages
                and, indeed, to Ullans.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is undoubtedly a matter on which the
                Assembly will wish to consult, but those who want to pursue it
                in the meantime should remember that decisions about the
                facilities and funding to be made available to us are currently
                the prerogative of the Secretary of State. Anyone wishing to
                raise such an issue should do so with her.</p>

                about the facilities in the House. I wonder why nothing has been
                said about the elaborate bar that is being provided in the
                basement. That is very strange. In the society in which I was

                8 of the schedule to the Northern Ireland (Elections) Act 1998,
                the privilege given to Members speaking in the House is
                qualified. It is not the absolute privilege which pertains in
                other assemblies and which will apply here when the Assembly
                takes power on the appointed day as set out in the Act. The

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;A written or oral statement made by a

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the debate on the interim
                report from the First Minister (Designate) and the Deputy First

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It seems quite inappropriate for the First
                Minister (Designate) and the Deputy First Minister (Designate)
                to produce a report and simply table it for Members. As the
                report is devoid of substance, that is not a problem today. If
                there were some substance — for instance, a proposal capable
                of amendment — we would need more time to deal with it. On
                this occasion, however, it is not a problem.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Initial Presiding Officer:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You are quite right to draw attention to the
                procedural question of how far in advance Members need to have
                sight of reports and other papers. It is generally appreciated
                that reports should not be widely distributed before they are
                presented in the Assembly. The Assembly has the right to see
                them before others do, although in other places Front-Bench
                spokesmen are often given sight of material shortly — perhaps
                an hour or so — before it is presented. Whether this should be
                considered by the Standing Orders Committee, or whether it is a
                matter of a convention to be understood by Whips’ offices or
                others, is something for the Assembly to decide.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When Assembly Members sign the Roll they
                register a designation — &quot;Unionist&quot;,
                &quot;Nationalist&quot; or &quot;Other&quot;. It is also the
                practice to give the name of the party to which they belong.
                Members will know from the draft Standing Orders that the
                Secretary&nbsp;of&nbsp;State also wishes to establish a register
                of political parties. At this juncture there is no Standing
                Order dealing with the question of those who wish to identify
                themselves as belonging to a political party other than the one
                for which they stood in the election.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have received from Mr Agnew, Mr Douglas and
                Mr Watson a note saying that, following discussion, they have
                agreed to form a United Unionist Assembly Party, with
                Mr&nbsp;Watson as Leader. There is no Standing Order under which
                to give a ruling, or to assist with giving a ruling, on how they
                should now be treated. The nearest Standing Order is the one
                dealing with the signing of the Roll and the registering of a
                designation. Seven days’ notice of any change of designation
                is required.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have discussed this with the parties, and
                it has been accepted that, in the absence of a new Standing
                Order which would clarify the matter, we should apply the seven
                days’ written notice Rule. The party will therefore be
                formally recognised in seven days’ time, and any arrangements
                in respect of it will become substantive then.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Northern Ireland Bill, like other Bills
                of a similar nature, provides for the establishment of a body
                corporate to take responsibility for all legal matters relevant
                to the Assembly, for the provision of property, staff, services
                and financial arrangements for Members and for other such
                matters.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given that the Commission will take full
                responsibility for these matters on the appointed day, and given
                that in respect of all other matters shadow arrangements have
                been made in order that Assembly Members may read themselves
                into their responsibilities, it is proposed that the Commission
                be established on the same basis and with the same numbers and
                arrangements as provided for in the Act during the period of the
                shadow Assembly.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.00 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to emphasise one or two things. First,
                the number of Members was to be five, but I have been advised
                that some of the smaller parties are not content with this.
                Representations on the matter will need to be made to the
                Secretary of State. It is possible for the number to be
                increased, but that will be a matter for the Secretary of State.
                Anyway, there is no guarantee that places would be taken up by
                any particular party. It is a matter for the Assembly</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, Members will notice that some
                aspects of the motion are definite — for example, in respect
                of composition — and others are less so. The item
                &quot;Quorum&quot;, to which we need to refer under the Initial
                Standing Orders, states that the Commission will decide its
                quorum at the first meeting. The reason for this lack of
                definition is that in the Act it is left to the substantive
                Commission to decide its own quorum. Should the Assembly wish to
                give guidance to the shadow Commission, that, I am sure, would
                not be inappropriate. The motion simply follows closely the
                matters set out in the Act.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thirdly, I should emphasise that these
                appointments are to the shadow Assembly Commission and will be
                in force only for the shadow period. There will need to be a new
                resolution — possibly with changes in the membership, and so
                on — for the substantive Commission.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Molloy:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the setting up of the Commission,
                for it is a very important body. It is important that there be
                transparency in dealings about property, staff and services. We
                should also ensure that there is equality of employment. We must
                deal with the whole issue of fair employment in the Civil
                Service. It is important that the Commission be set up now and
                that its work proceed as quickly as possible.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to services and property, there
                is an issue which concerns me. During the presidential visit the
                Union flag was not flown on this Building. Nor was the Stars and
                Stripes. Surely that would have been correct protocol. It was an
                insult to the sovereignty of this state and against the Belfast
                Agreement.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Initial Presiding Officer:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The visit was under the auspices of the
                Government, who still have control of the Building. I understand
                that protocol advice was taken and was followed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Management of the Building will come under
                the auspices of the Commission after the devolution of power.
                Some aspects of the running of the estate will stay in other
                hands, unless it is decided to change the arrangements.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Responsibility for the way in which matters
                are dealt with within the Building will be shared by the
                Commission, Assembly Members and the Executive — the First and
                Deputy First Ministers already occupy some parts of the Building
                — and there will need to be some discussion and negotiation.
                It would be valuable to have a shadow Commission to explore
                these matters before power is devolved.</p>

                of the section headed &quot;Economic, Social and Cultural

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is very important. I appreciate —
                indeed, Sinn&nbsp;Fein appreciates — that there are citizens
                here who value the Union flag, but we do not. There must be
                parity of esteem and equality of opportunity. We need to move
                into a new situation in which, with the agreement in mind, the
                Irish national flag is given parity with the Union flag.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr&nbsp;Initial
                Presiding Officer. I am not sure of the protocol followed by the
                Government, but I think that it is very doubtful. Usually the
                flags of both countries are flown on certain occasions, but I am
                not at all surprised at what the Member has said, for
                Her&nbsp;Majesty’s Lord Lieutenants were also snubbed during
                the visit of the President. What is more, the President’s
                helicopter would not land in the Army barracks at Armagh. It was
                said that that could offend the Irish Republican Army and damage
                the peace process. Special arrangements had to be made.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These are serious matters, and I do not think
                anyone on this side of the House would interpret what has been
                said by the Leader of IRA/Sinn Fein as meaning that the Union
                flag should not be flown. There is no such thing in the
                agreement, and it would be ridiculous to say that the national
                flag could not be flown on a building of this nature.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Perhaps you would also clarify whether the
                grounds and the Building will come under the auspices of the
                Commission.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">May I prevail upon Members to try to keep to
                the business motion, as, indeed, Dr Paisley has just done. As I
                understand it, the current state of affairs is that this
                Building will come under the auspices of the Assembly
                Commission, but not all parts of the estate. Some parts of the
                estate are likely to remain under the direct control of the
                Secretary of State. The Assembly will clearly want to discuss,
                and perhaps even negotiate, these matters. This emphasises the
                need for a &quot;Shadow&quot; body to enable Members to become
                clearer about certain issues in advance of taking power.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is essentially a business motion to
                establish the Commission, and I urge Members not to stray into

                direct its attention to the management not just of this Building
                but of all buildings and land within the Stormont Estate.
                Originally, under devolution, Stormont&nbsp;Castle was very much
                the seat of the Executive, and Stormont&nbsp;House was the seat
                of the then Speaker. I can understand that in recent years there

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">By way of background I should explain that
                the Procedure Committee of the House of Commons is enquiring
                into the procedural consequences of devolution, including
                relationships with the Northern&nbsp;Ireland Assembly, the
                Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly. Members of the House
                of Commons and parties represented there are, of course, free to
                make their own representations, and will undoubtedly do so, but
                the Assembly itself has been asked to make representations on
                the matter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The House of Commons Procedure Committee has
                identified a number of detailed concerns on which comments are
                welcome, but has invited the response by 9&nbsp;October. There
                have been discussions with all the parties on this matter, and
                there is a general view that the Assembly should take the
                opportunity to comment on these and any other related matters.
                Therefore the motion has been put on the Order Paper so that a
                response can be made to the Procedure Committee on or before
                9&nbsp;October.</p>

                Standing Orders. However, there is no provision for
                representation from the United Unionist Party, which will be
                recognised fully in a week’s time. That party will have a
                greater claim to membership of the Committee than the Northern
                Ireland Women’s Coalition or the Progressive Unionist Party
                and the Committee’s business will still be on-going when the
                United Unionist Party is fully recognised as a political party
                in this Assembly.</p>

                When the Standing Orders Committee was established that
                Committee invited at an early stage an observer from those who
                were, and who are still described as Independent Members.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I should also add that a similar invitation
                was accepted in respect of the Committee to Advise the Presiding
                Officer.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Having advised the Assembly today that a new
                party will be recognised in seven days’ time, this matter must
                now be considered properly by the Committee on Standing Orders
                both on the question of recognition, about which I have made an
                interim ruling, and on the question of Committee compositions.
                The number of Members on Committees is at its maximum, and the
                Committee on Standing Orders may wish to advise the Assembly on
                this matter. It is proper that this Committee review the
                Assembly’s Standing Orders, and likewise the Whips should
                discuss the matter themselves and with the representative of the
                new party.</p>

                these are distinct from &quot;political consequences.&quot;</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My understanding is that the House of Commons
                Procedure Committee is looking at procedures at Westminster
                subsequent to devolution. It will not be giving guidance on how
                the Assembly should deal with its procedures. In the past, in
                other political arrangements and when this Chamber was in use,
                there were certain conventions about what could and could not be
                done. With the expansion of devolution, and in these different
                circumstances, more than mere conventions may be required. There
                are also issues about how the House of Commons would address
                some of these matters such as the membership of Committees. Of
                course, we now also have the question of Europe and its
                relationship with Westminster. However, it is not an examination
                of our procedures so much as an examination of the procedures
                that Westminster may wish to make changes to having invited our
                comments.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you have made a ruling on this, then I am
                not quite sure what it is. I asked about the position of the
                prospective United Unionist Assembly Party. Are you saying that
                the Committee on Standing Orders should give an early report on
                that matter before it reports in full on 26&nbsp;October? A lot
                of water may have flowed under the bridge by that date.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to this Committee’s role, the
                House of Commons is looking at the impact of devolution in
                Scotland, Wales and Northern&nbsp;Ireland on the procedures of
                the House. For instance, will a Minister responsible to the
                United&nbsp;Kingdom Parliament be answerable for matters that
                are the responsibility of this elected body? Will he answer
                questions in Parliament on Northern&nbsp;Ireland, questions
                relating to environment, health and education? Will written
                answers come from prospective Ministers in this Assembly? Will a
                Select Committee for Northern&nbsp;Ireland have the right to
                look at matters which have been delegated to the Assembly in
                Northern Ireland?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those are issues that this Committee will
                look at. It will also look at the famed West Lothian question
                — whether representatives who have no right in the House of
                Commons to amend legislation for Northern&nbsp;Ireland should
                see the legislation for their part of the United&nbsp;Kingdom
                amended by Northern&nbsp;Ireland Members.</p>

                entirely improper.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the new party is recognised in seven
                days’ time, that will have consequences for the memberships of
                Committees because, under the current Standing Orders the
                Committees cannot increase the numbers of places. Any proposed
                changes will have to be considered by the Standing Orders
                Committee which could come back to the Assembly in advance of 26
                October with a number of interim reports or reports on various
                issues and seek the Assembly’s backing for approval by the
                Secretary of State. However, it would be quite improper for me
                to give a directive to the Standing Orders Committee. It will
                conduct its own business.</p>

                presented by the Northern&nbsp;Ireland Forum on both Scottish
                and Welsh devolution.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Indeed, there is another procedural question
                which must be addressed and that is the relationship that this

                be coming directly from Europe to the Floor of the House, and we
                will have to consider the procedural ramifications of that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that we will be able to report by
                6&nbsp;October. I note that one report has already been produced
                since 1&nbsp;July. It is not a comprehensive report at all, and
                I hope that this Committee, when established, will be able to

                wishing to add to the work of that Committee unnecessarily, I
                think that the Initial Standing Orders are already clear on this
                point. We do not need clarification from the Standing Orders
                Committee, for Rule 15(2) says</p>

                the Standing Orders Committee, to implement the Rule. The Rule
                also requires that there should be, as far as possible, a fair
                reflection of parties participating in the Assembly. Since there
                is an upper limit of 18 seats, amendments will have to be made
                simply to the balance of the parties on the Committee. It does
                not need any further consideration by the Standing Orders

                could, for example, decide to solve the problem by increasing
                the upper limit to 19&nbsp;members, or by coming to some other
                arrangement, but it would be quite out of order for me to direct

                in respect of Rule 15(2) of the preliminary Standing Orders. The
                problem — and it is one that members of the Democratic
                Unionist Party raised in the Standing Orders Committee — is
                what precisely is to be understood by the word
                &quot;party&quot;. That is a matter that the Standing Orders
                Committee will have to return to at the appointed time.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee to Advise the Presiding Officer
                agreed that the proper course would be to recognise the new
                political party seven days after notice had been given; that
                issue is settled. So under the Initial Standing Orders that
                party will, as from next Monday, have an entitlement to one
                place on each Committee. However, if the composition of this
                Committee is as shown on the Order Paper there would be no place
                available since the Initial Standing Orders make it clear that
                the maximum membership is 18. Therefore the representation of
                one of the existing parties would need to be reduced by one.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The two parties that have the most
                representation per head are the Social Democratic and Labour
                Party and Sinn Fein. Their representation should be reduced by
                one to allow a Member from that Committee, the United Unionist
                Assembly Party, to be included.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should remember that the Committees were
                established not only by Standing Orders but also by a motion in
                the Assembly. The representation by party was fixed by an
                Assembly motion on 1&nbsp;July 1998; I would be exceeding my
                authority were I to allow any changes to the membership of that
                Committee except by a further motion. Your proposition should
                more properly be made to the Standing Orders Committee or in a
                motion to the next meeting of the Assembly.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is it not correct that the responsibility for
                these Initial Standing Orders lies with the Secretary of State?
                She imposed them, and we have had to accept them. That being the
                case, this is not a decision for the Standing Orders Committee
                of this House. The Secretary of State must decide. Surely you
                should be making representation to her, pointing out the
                inconsistency caused by the creation of this new party and
                suggesting that she agree to their being represented on the
                Committees.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Initial Presiding Officer:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I appreciate your analysis of the lines of
                authority, Dr Paisley, but I think it is not entirely correct.
                The authority under which these Standing Orders were put in
                place is, indeed, that of the Secretary of State. Any changes of
                any description to the Standing Orders between now and the
                devolution of power have to be authorised by the Secretary of
                State. However, the execution of those Standing Orders is a
                matter for the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the Secretary of State were not convinced
                that her wishes were being carried out she would, of course, be
                entirely at liberty to make that clear. She has already made
                clear her wish that any further Standing Orders which, as you
                quite rightly say, she would have to authorise, should be made,
                as far as possible, with the agreement of the Assembly. That is
                why — and I make this point on behalf of the Assembly — no
                new Standing Orders should be put in place until the Standing
                Orders Committee and, if possible, the Assembly as a whole has
                been consulted.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You will note that no new
                Standing&nbsp;Orders have been put in place yet prior to the
                initial Report of the Standing Orders Committee and today’s
                debate. I imagine that the Assembly will want those proprieties
                to continue to be recognised.</p>

                Unionist Party is obviously concerned. These Members are
                anti-agreement, and they want to rejig the arithmetic. These
                three Members are clearly within the Unionist bloc, and should
                there be any pruning of the representation, then the parties
                losing a seat or seats should also be within the Unionist bloc,
                in keeping with the broad sense of this agreement.</p>

                representation from one bloc or another; it is a case of getting
                the fullest representation on the Committee. The arithmetic
                means that the Ulster Unionist Party has one representative for
                every seven Members, which is roughly the same as the Democratic
                Unionist Party. By contrast the Social Democratic and Labour
                Party and Sinn Fein each have one representative for every six
                Members, so very clearly it is one of those two parties that has
                to give up one of its Members. In that vein may I ask you,
                Mr&nbsp;Initial&nbsp;Presiding&nbsp;Officer, to move an

                is quite clear about the membership as things were extant. There

                recognised until 10.20 am next Monday — seven days from the
                receipt of the written notice. Therefore the question about its
                membership of Committees will have to wait until after that
                time. It would be entirely proper at that stage for the tabling
                of a motion to deal with the matter.</p>

                Monday there will be a motion ensuring that the Standing Orders
                to which this Assembly is bound shall be upheld and that they
                will have membership of that Committee?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I cannot give the Member an immediate ruling.
                In the Initial Standing Orders and in the draft Orders which the
                Secretary&nbsp;of&nbsp;State sent, and which so many Members
                will have perused, there is a curious absence of information
                about how to deal with the circumstances in which a Member
                changes his party affiliation, a change which may also affect
                the representative arrangements. This is therefore a more
                important matter than membership of this ad&nbsp;hoc committee.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The draft Standing Orders indicate clearly
                the way in which the d’Hondt system should proceed, and when
                the time comes we will do that. However, if a number of Members
                were then to indicate that they were changing their party
                affiliation, subsequent to that, but not their designation as
                Unionist, Nationalist or Other affiliation, then it is quite
                possible that that could change the numbers and the out-working
                of d’Hondt if it were to be reworked at that point. But there
                is no indication about whether it should be reworked at that
                point; whether it should be reworked on the initiation of the
                Presiding&nbsp;Officer of the time; or whether it should require
                a motion to the Assembly proposing that there be a reworking.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is clearly an omission in the Standing
                Orders. It is not surprising that there should be such an
                omission, but I am extremely reluctant, as Initial Presiding
                Officer, to give a ruling on it without thoroughly considering
                the question and consulting with the parties. It may be that
                events will require me to consult, or I may be pressed to make
                some kind of ruling. If so, I will do so as properly and as soon
                as I can. However, the issue only came to me, in a formal way, a
                few minutes before we met, and it would be quite wrong for me to
                make a ruling without such due consideration.</p>

                they are precise. Standing Order 15.2 says that each party, with
                at least two Members, shall have at least one seat on each
                Committee. You will want to ensure that these Standing Orders
                are upheld and, therefore, I ask you to consider that matter. I
                give notice that if the maximum number on any Committee is 18,
                one seat has to be made available for the new party. If we are
                sitting next Monday, we will propose that Sinn Fein’s
                representation be reduced by one to allow the new party to have
                that one seat.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I indicated — and our practice during
                the first meeting of the Assembly made this clear — people are
                free to respond in a number of different ways, and I will do my
                best to interpret what is said accurately and correctly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In whatever language Members wish to respond
                — and most notably, as you indicate, in Irish, or in
                Ulster-Scots as some Members used at the last meeting — I
                assume they will do so at the appropriate point when I call for
                the Ayes and the Noes. Otherwise the Clerks and I will be left
                in some confusion.</p>

                trying to work out a new dispensation, and we should not allow
                the issue of the Irish language to become party political or to
                in any way be seen as being Ulster or Nationalist. It is
                therefore appropriate in your position of Cathaoirleach that you
                reflect that when addressing the Assembly. You did so very
                clearly at the first meeting; I note that it has not been done

                and utterly confused about whether this House is for or against
                a motion. Why can Members not vote in the way that is laid down
                in the Standing Orders — by saying either &quot;Aye&quot; or

                widely as you suggest, I would be entitled to use my preferred
                response in recognition of how people in east Belfast say yes or
                no. If this House is to understand whether Members are for or
                against a motion — and I noticed the odd syllable of English
                creeping into some of Mr&nbsp;Maskey’s speeches this morning
                — can we not just stick to saying &quot;Yes&quot; or
                &quot;No&quot; in a language which I hope we can all speak and

                that &quot;Catch yourself on&quot; means something rather
                different. That is why I appeal to Members that if they wish to
                give assent, they do so in whatever way they wish, either with a
                positive grunt or a more clear articulation when I ask for the
                ayes, and those who wish to vote against give a negative grunt,
                or whatever, when I ask for the noes, and we will do our best to

                intriguing story of fancy political footwork and occasional
                trick photography, but I will not bore Members with the details.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the other members of the Committee
                for their hard work and their contribution to the formulation of
                this document. I also thank others who have attended in their
                capacity as observers for their interest in the work of the

                the Second Clerk and the Third Clerk for their very considerable
                help. The Committee has worked expeditiously and harmoniously to
                get to this point.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee was set up by the Assembly on 1
                July 1998, under Paragraph 15 of the Initial Standing Orders,
                and the terms of reference are as follows:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;To assist the Assembly in its
                consideration of Standing Orders and to report to the Assembly
                by 14&nbsp;September 1998.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee has a composition of four
                Members from the Ulster Unionist Party, four from the Social
                Democratic and Labour Party, three from the Democratic Unionist
                Party, three from Sinn Fein and one each from the Alliance
                Party, the United Kingdom Unionist Party, the Progressive
                Unionist Party and the Northern Ireland Women’s Coalition. In
                the course of its business, the Committee also accorded observer
                status to the Independent Unionist grouping. It met for the
                first time on 6 July and there have been five meetings of the
                Committee since then.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, the Committee gathered information
                from a wide-range of sources. We looked at examples of Standing
                Orders from the House of Commons, from the Dáil, from the
                European Parliament and from other bodies. We have considered 11
                Rules, agreeing seven of them and remitting the other four for
                further in-depth consideration at future meetings. There is a
                full list of those in Annex A to the Report.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have also had to deal with the Additional
                Standing Orders sent to us by the Secretary of State, by way of
                consultation. Members will find a copy of those draft Additional
                Standing Orders in the Report along with the Committee’s
                response to them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The letter from the Minister of State,
                Mr&nbsp;Murphy, indicates clearly that the opinions of the
                Committee on Standing Orders are being listened to. We must now
                deal with some potentially difficult Standing Orders and, from
                next week, the Committee will be meeting twice a week in order
                to take this business forward.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I commend this report to the House. It
                represents the product of many hours of hard and constructive
                work by members and officials of the Committee.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dodds:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I join Mr&nbsp;Haughey in expressing our
                gratitude to the clerks who have had to work very hard at the
                outset of this Committee to gather all the relevant papers and
                documentation from other places. The real work of this Committee
                begins now, for we have really only begun to discuss the main
                issues. It would be wrong to deal just with the procedures and
                the setting up of the Committee and not to detail some of the
                issues which the Committee has already dealt with and, indeed,
                some of the issues which we may have to deal with shortly in
                order to meet the 26 October deadline.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A number of the issues that the Committee has
                dealt with relate to issues that have already arisen today in
                the House. This demonstrates the need to resolve these issues
                urgently, in particular, the question of designation and the
                issue of whether Members should be entitled to change
                designation by giving seven days’ notice. This is not in the
                agreement or in the legislation. But here we have it in the
                Standing Orders, designed to allow Members to jump back and
                forward at seven days’ notice to help particular parties out
                of a difficulty if they feel that they are not going to obtain
                support in the House under the cross-community voting provision.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Despite the opposition of some Ulster
                Unionist Party Members — not all of them — and one or two of
                the smaller parties, I am glad to report that there seems to be
                a general consensus that it is wrong in principle that Members
                who designate themselves as Unionists or Nationalists should,
                after seven days’ notice, be able to change their designation
                purely for the purposes of ensuring that a particular vote is
                won in either the Unionist or National block and then switch
                back to their real designation. Such action would bring this
                House and its proceedings into total disrepute and so it is
                essential that when we are dealing with these Standing Orders,
                we delete this offensive mechanism.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope the Committee Members will see that
                this is a matter of principle and that when Members designate
                themselves as either Unionist or Nationalist, that designation
                should remain — that was the intention and purpose of the
                arrangements that were set up.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the smaller parties argued that it
                would allow for movement if people could change their
                designation. But the only effect of changing from Unionist to
                Other or from Nationalist to Other is that one’s vote is lost
                for the purposes of cross-community voting. The only reason that
                parties want to have this procedural ability to change
                designation is to ensure that, instead of their vote not
                counting under the cross-community provisions, it will count on
                certain occasions when it suits either the Ulster Unionist Party
                or the Social Democratic and Labour Party.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to discuss one or two of the matters
                outlined in the draft Initial Standing Orders sent to the
                Members of the Committee by the Secretary of State and to which
                you referred earlier. The Secretary of State has undertaken to
                take on board what is said by the Committee and by the Assembly
                today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">May I draw Members’ attention to page 1 of
                the Committee on Standing Orders’ Report and, in particular,
                to paragraph B, &quot;Appointment of Ministers
                (Designate)&quot;. It was advanced in the Committee that the
                Assembly should not only have the ability to pass or to reject
                proposals coming from the First Minister (Designate) and the
                Deputy First Minister (Designate) in relation to the numbers of
                Departments and the functions within each Department, but that
                Members of the Assembly should also have the right to table
                amendments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Amazingly there was a view advanced in the
                Standing Orders Committee that that would not be appropriate;
                that it should be a take-it-or-leave-it issue, that when the
                First Minister (Designate) and Deputy First Minister (Designate)
                present to this Assembly their substantive report, the Members’
                should accept it or reject it in total and not have the right to
                put down amendments as the First Minister (Designate) and the
                Deputy First Minister (Designate) would, of course, have
                consulted widely.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The same argument was used during the years
                of direct rule when we were not allowed to amend Orders in
                Council which were brought to the House of Commons by Northern
                Ireland Office Ministers. We had to accept or reject them in
                total.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There were six members of the Committee who
                voted against a proposal that it should be explicitly recognised
                within Standing Orders that we should have the right to put down
                amendments to any such proposal. I hope that the Minister
                present today, will convey the tenor of our deliberations back
                to the Secretary&nbsp;of&nbsp;State and that she will consider
                that there has been a cross-community vote in favour of ensuring
                that amendments can be put forward and deliberated by the
                Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">May I also draw Members’ attention to part
                D, headed &quot;Exclusion or Removal from Office&quot;, of the
                Secretary of State’s draft Additional Standing Orders. The
                Committee has completely omitted any provision which would
                enable the Secretary&nbsp;of&nbsp;State to table or bring to the
                attention of the Assembly those matters that were so important
                during the House of Commons debate. The
                Secretary&nbsp;of&nbsp;State inserted provisions into the
                Northern Ireland Bill which enable her to consider certain
                issues, such as parties not committed to exclusively peaceful
                means, or parties that do not co-operate with the
                decommissioning body or parties who are engaged in paramilitary
                punishment attacks and so on.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There was also provision for those matters to
                be referred to the Assembly. However, there is no provision in
                the Standing Orders for that. Whether that was simply an
                oversight or whether it was deliberate remains to be seen, but
                it must be rectified by the Secretary of State when she
                considers these Initial Standing Orders and when she receives
                the report from the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is incredible to think that the Northern
                Ireland Office could have overlooked this matter, which was the
                subject of intense debate and deliberation in the House of
                Commons. The Northern Ireland Office, having deliberated and
                assured us that these were all issues that the
                Secretary&nbsp;of&nbsp;State would take into account, made no
                provision for the Assembly’s part in that or for any motion to
                be put down other than by the First Minister (Designate), the
                Deputy First Minister (Designate) of a Commission of
                30&nbsp;Members. That must be rectified as well, and I hope that
                the Secretary&nbsp;of&nbsp;State will do that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am sure that Members will devote themselves
                assiduously to the path that is before us. It will be
                challenging to meet the 26&nbsp;October deadline, but it is
                absolutely essential that we have Standing Orders which are
                owned by the Members of this Assembly and which have not simply
                been imposed upon us by the Secretary&nbsp;of&nbsp;State. If we
                leave it to the Secretary&nbsp;of&nbsp;State, we will not have
                Standing Orders which will be acceptable to the vast majority of
                Members.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When I came here this morning I was reminded
                of some words from Scripture:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Lord, it is good to be here.&quot;</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Having been here for an hour and a half, I am
                now beginning to doubt whether it is good. However, I would like
                to join in the thanks being given to the two co-Chairmen of the
                Standing Orders Committee and to all the Committee Members. We
                have worked diligently over these past few weeks at our task to
                produce the rules necessary for the good order and conduct of
                the House. We did, as has already been stated, I suppose take
                the easy way out. We began with the less contentious issues.
                Undoubtedly there will be others which will be more difficult to
                resolve in the future.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report before us is self-explanatory, and
                in commending it to the Assembly I would like to draw attention
                to two specific issues. One is the thorny issue of designation
                whereby</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Members shall then take their seats by
                signing the Assembly’s Role of Membership and registering a
                designation of identity — Nationalist, Unionist or [ ]&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members will note the brackets in the report,
                whereas in the Initial Standing Orders produced by the Secretary
                of State, the word &quot;Other&quot; was included there. Since
                its inception, this party has made it absolutely clear that we
                are not large &quot;N&quot; Nationalist or large &quot;U&quot;
                Unionist. We want to continue to be known, as we have done so
                over the last 20-odd years, that we are clearly a party of the
                centre, of that there is no doubt. The electorate know and
                appreciate that, and the Standing Orders of this House must
                recognise those who are not large &quot;N&quot; Nationalist or
                large &quot;U&quot; Unionist.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Initial Standing Orders state that
                Members designate themselves as &quot;Unionist, Nationalist or
                Other&quot;. It is quite clear to the Alliance Party that that
                &quot;Other&quot; refers to &quot;Other&quot; designation. It is
                not just &quot;Other&quot; left hanging in mid-air. That is why
                we have argued and will continue to argue that the word
                &quot;centre&quot; must be permissible to designation. We will
                not be arrogant and dictate to other Members how they wish their
                designation to be described. I am perfectly happy for the
                Members of the Ulster Unionist Party, the Democratic Unionist
                Party, the Progressive Unionist Party or whoever else to
                designate themselves as Unionist.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like clarification as to the real
                argument that Mr Close is making about designation. I am sure
                that everyone in the House understands the centre ground when
                one talks about economics or social policies, but what in
                constitutional terms is his definition of the centre ground
                between Unionism and Nationalism? It would be a very intriguing
                explanation in view of his remarks.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Close:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Member for giving me the
                opportunity to explain and I could do so at great length, but I
                feel that today would be an inappropriate time in which to
                describe exactly where the Alliance Party stands. The Member
                believes and understands the Alliance Party’s ethos, why it
                came into being and its <i>raison d’être</i> in Northern
                Ireland. The job it has been doing in Northern Ireland needs no
                further clarification from me. I am referring here to the
                Initial Standing Orders produced by the Secretary of State where
                they say</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Members shall take their seats by
                signing the Assembly’s roll of membership and registering a
                designation of identity — Nationalist, Unionist or
                Other.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My argument is that that &quot;Other&quot;,
                as far as the Alliance Party is concerned, means centre. Members
                should not have any difficulty with that because I am perfectly
                content to accept other parties’ designation of themselves. So
                please do the Alliance Party the courtesy of permitting itself
                to be described as a centre party.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dodds referred to this change of identity
                every seven days. We are offering the people of Northern Ireland
                a new opportunity, we want them to respect the dealings and
                operations of this House. We do not want to start off with some
                farcical procedure by which Members can change their designation
                willy-nilly by giving seven days’ notice. That would do us all
                a tremendous disservice, and I urge that that particular
                Standing Order be changed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has been argued that we should recognise
                people’s right to change their designation, and as I suggested
                at the Standing Order Committee meeting, let us recognise that
                right. Perhaps they made a mistake; perhaps they were not sure
                of where they stood, and they should have the right to change.
                But I believe that that right should be restricted to one
                occasion. If they wish to change, let them change once and have
                done with it. But let us not have a situation where on a weekly
                basis, simply for expediency or to thwart the purposes of votes
                in this House, individuals can move from one side to the other.
                That would be inappropriate. This is all I have to say on these
                two issues at this stage. There are others which will, no doubt,
                arise in the weeks ahead. I commend the Report to the House.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms McWilliams:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I, too, rise to respond to this particular
                Standing Order and for exactly the same reasons.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the Northern Ireland Womens’ Coalition
                Members signed the Roll Book, we wrote &quot;Inclusive
                Other&quot;, our reason being that we hope that one day in this
                country people’s political identities can be respected as
                crossing and that we will be able to work with our differences.
                I understand the reasons why the voting mechanisms are as they
                are in the agreement, but the opportunity should be available
                for those who wish to have themselves designated in a different
                way to do so.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">By designating yourself as centre, you are
                saying to the rest of the people here that they are at the
                extremes and I do not believe that to be the case. There will be
                many times when people in this room will take a central,
                socialist or a conservative position on particular social and
                economic issues and no one should be viewed as being extreme for
                having done so.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fact that the seven-day rule is there
                permits a party like ours to protect the agreement. We will not
                vote according to whether it is a Nationalist or a Unionist
                issue. We will vote to protect the agreement, which is the
                mandate on which we were elected. We believe that this rule has
                been inserted to allow us to protect the agreement against those
                who were not in favour of it and do not wish for it to be
                proceeded by this House. We will give the required notice.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The situation will not be so radical; Members
                will have seven days’ notice and those who are opposed to the
                particular issues will know in advance what the arguments will
                be. The Northern&nbsp;Ireland Women’s Coalition will insist
                that this rule is not changed so that people may take advantage
                of it only once; it should remain throughout the four years
                during which the House will be sitting.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a review mechanism in the agreement,
                and those who are unhappy with the current voting procedures or
                the designations, which some would say institutionalise
                sectarianism in this county, can give notice to have that
                review.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But the Standing Order present should be
                retained so that those who experience no difficulty representing
                Nationalists, Unionists and others, in the most inclusive
                fashion, can protect the agreement when we need to.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCartney:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I speak as a member of the Standing Orders
                Committee. My remarks relate specifically to the rule that would
                give licence to political chameleons who wish from time to time
                to change their colour according to the exigencies of the day.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It should be immediately apparent to everyone
                that the working of the Assembly, and whatever structures arise
                from it, is to be based on consensus. The consensus was
                constructed by the agreement to facilitate an operation between
                the two essential groups in Northern Ireland who have been
                advancing their political goals and ideologies: Unionists and
                Nationalists. Indeed, if one looks at the agreement, and
                particularly at the arrangements made for dealing with that
                consensus, one will see that the agreement provides for either a
                majority, a clear majority, within each of those communities or,
                in some circumstances, for a 40% majority.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What was the reason for that? The reason was
                to ensure that, within each community there would be agreement
                that what was being advanced by both was a basis for ongoing
                business. The Ulster Unionists have a very, very narrow majority
                with 28&nbsp;Members plus the assistance of those who have
                demonstrated themselves to be consistent allies, the Progressive
                Unionist Party, giving them a total of 30.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the other hand, opposed to the views of
                the Ulster Unionist grouping are the Democratic Unionist Party,
                the United Kingdom Unionist Party and the three Independents,
                making 28 in number. What is proposed now is to allow the two
                members of the Northern Ireland Women’s Coalition to hop about
                from a Nationalist designation to a Unionist designation, on
                seven days’ notice, which would give them a degree of
                influence entirely out of proportion to the votes they got
                throughout Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have no argument whatever with the
                advancement of the rights of women, though I find a political
                party calling itself the Women’s Coalition a rather curious
                phenomenon, but that is another matter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But the point I do make is that the Women’s
                Coalition originally entered the negotiations on the basis of
                what many people saw as a completely anti-democratic
                arrangement. Under the top-up system 20 seats were divided among
                the top 10 parties thus allowing the Northern Ireland Women’s
                Coalition to have two seats when its total vote in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland was a little over 6,000. Now we have those
                two Members with limited electoral support endeavouring to do
                something which is fundamentally opposed to the principle of
                consensus upon which the agreement is based: they want to play
                see-saw Marjorie daw by changing their designation from
                &quot;Nationalist&quot; to &quot;Unionist&quot; when any crucial
                vote is about to come up.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In those circumstances the proposal put
                forward by the Assembly Member for South Belfast
                (Ms&nbsp;McWilliams) is one that would strike at the very roots
                of democratic consensus in the Assembly, and Nigel&nbsp;Dodds,
                the Assembly Member for North Belfast, has shown us the dangers
                of that very clearly.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I now want to turn to the remarks made by
                Mr&nbsp;Close on the matter of designation. The agreement
                provides for three designations — Nationalist, Unionist and
                Others, and in that context &quot;other&quot; was not being used
                in some derogatory way. Those who are neither Nationalist nor
                Unionist are &quot;other&quot; and the Alliance Party has
                demonstrated that it does not wish to be associated with any
                particular grouping, Nationalist or Unionist.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is entirely irrelevant whether it is
                designated &quot;centre&quot; or &quot;other&quot; because it is
                certainly not Nationalist or Unionist, neither of whom, even
                allowing for the degree of ecumenism that occasionally creeps
                into both parties, could conceivably be described as centre.
                Whether you say left or right, Nationalist or Unionist, none of
                those terms of themselves in itself designates a person as an
                extremist of one form or another.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is my proposal that those who are neither
                Nationalist nor Unionist can describe themselves in whatever way
                they like, but they ought not be permitted to change more than
                once. There is good sense and fairness in allowing people to
                decide that, broadly speaking, their party is now convinced that
                the Unionist or Nationalist ideology and goals are what it
                should opt for, but such people should be permitted to do that
                only once in a four-year term.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I commend to the House the sentiments
                expressed both by Mr&nbsp;Dodds and by Mr&nbsp;Close.</p>

                been borne out by the comments by Ms&nbsp;McWilliams. Under the
                guise of protecting the agreement, she has suggested that the
                Women’s Coalition’s intention is its designation as
                &quot;other&quot; so that sometimes it can be Unionist and
                sometimes it can be Nationalist, not on the basis of any
                political principle, but purely to influence a vote. I have no
                trouble with the words of one member of the Women’s Coalition
                who said</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The Women’s Coalition wished to be
                all things to all men.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I think that that was rather inappropriate,
                but to try to influence a vote in either community, to change
                and dance around, purely for that purpose, is wrong.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Mr&nbsp;Close said, it would bring the
                Assembly into disrepute in the eyes of the general public, if
                someone was able to dance about like that, under the guise of
                protecting the agreement, while really seeking to subvert the
                views of those who have expressed themselves as either Unionist
                or Nationalist. The Rule must be amended, and I hope that
                Members will accept that a small group cannot be allowed to
                manipulate the Assembly in this way.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am glad to see that the Committee had the
                good sense to agree that any proposal brought before the
                Assembly by the First Minister (Designate) or the Deputy First
                Minister (Designate) should be open to amendment. We do not want
                to have to accept it or reflect it simply.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the things said in defence of the
                agreement, especially by members of the Ulster Unionist Party,
                was that it would end the bad old days of Orders in Council in
                the House of Commons, that people would now be able to amend
                proposals that were brought forward. We cannot have that
                re-imposed on the Assembly. We must be able, when there are
                parts of a proposal brought before the Assembly that people do
                not like, to amend the proposal rather than have to vote the
                whole thing down.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I find it rather bizarre that those who
                defended that kind of undemocratic means of doing business were
                telling us that we did not need to worry, because the First
                Minister (Designate) and the Deputy First Minister (Designate)
                would take the opinions of the Assembly into account and consult
                their own parties.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">From the record of the First Minister
                (Designate) over the last number of months, it appears that he
                cannot even take account of opinion in his own party, let alone
                the Assembly. Therefore, it is important that we are able to
                amend reports that are brought forward, rather than simply vote
                on them. I hope that the Assembly will have the good sense to
                agree this and that the Secretary of State will have the good
                sense to accept the amendment as proposed by Mr&nbsp;McCartney.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to endorse the comments of
                Mr&nbsp;McCartney and Mr&nbsp;Wilson. This is a totally
                undemocratic Standing Order. For Members to be able to change a
                designation within seven days and then change it back would make
                us a laughing stock. I would support a proposal that a
                designation be changed once only — that would cover everybody
                and exclude no-one.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I take exception to Ms&nbsp;McWilliams
                implying that the United Kingdom Unionist Party is exclusively
                Unionist. It is important to clarify that the political
                affiliation of someone who comes to us on a constituency matter
                is not an issue.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to clear up the reference to me
                that was made by Mr&nbsp;S&nbsp;Wilson — the Northern Ireland
                Women’s Coalition is all things to all men and women and
                children.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Change of designation has been discussed. It
                is very interesting to note those who accuse the Women’s
                Coalition of possibly bringing the Assembly or the Agreement
                into disrepute. I am very happy to see that they are here to
                defend this institution, and I commend that. There is absolutely
                no question of the Northern Ireland Women’s Coalition’s
                bringing the agreement or the House into disrepute.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Any move to change our designation would be
                made purely in defence of the agreement. As Ms&nbsp;McWilliams
                said, we have been put here to defend the agreement, and we will
                do so. We come from pockets of Unionism, Nationalism and
                &quot;other&quot;, and we represent all three.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One very important thing that this Assembly
                must take on board is the ability to evolve. We do not want to
                get stuck in a mould. We want to be able to evolve towards a
                future that we can all support and work with. If we insist that
                there can be no change of designation, we are insisting that we
                stay in the mould that we have prescribed for ourselves from the
                start. I believe that the people who elected us would like to
                see us all evolve to the point where we can accept Unionism,
                Nationalism and &quot;other&quot; and move forward.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Haughey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Members for their contributions to a
                lively and interesting debate. There are one or two matters to
                which I ought to refer.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First of all, it is important to remember
                there is a distinction between the redraft of the Standing
                Orders which the Standing Orders Committee is considering and
                the additional Standing Orders which are being put forward by
                the Secretary of State to supplement the Initial Standing
                Orders. Under the legislation she has the authority to do so.
                The Standing Orders Committee was asked to comment on them; we
                have done that, and Members have a copy of our comments. That is
                a different issue from the redraft of the Standing Orders which
                will be adopted by the Assembly when it assumes full authority
                under the legislation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I presume that there will be a full debate on
                the final Report of the Standing Orders Committee when it comes
                before the Assembly and that Members will then be able to go
                into detail on the various provisions of the Standing Orders.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is also important to understand that the
                legislation currently going through the House of Commons will
                enshrine in law the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement, and
                may not depart from that agreement. It would be invidious and
                quite unacceptable if the elaboration of the Standing Orders of
                this Assembly were allowed in any way to unravel parts of that
                agreement or to revise provisions which are clearly part of the
                agreement which was endorsed by sufficient consensus of the
                parties in the talks and by the overwhelming majority of the
                electorate, North and South.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is further work to be done in relation
                to the question of designation and party, which, I remind
                Members, are two quite separate questions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The question of designation is addressed in
                the preliminary Standing Orders as laid down by the Secretary of
                State; however, our response to the Secretary of State’s draft
                additional Standing Orders says</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;it was agreed that the Secretary of
                State should be asked to give consideration to the need to
                define the meaning of ‘political party’.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is something which will arise in respect
                of both the Standing Orders under the Secretary of State’s
                authority for the shadow period and the final Standing Orders of
                the Assembly itself.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Standing Orders Committee has given some
                attention to the question of party and designation. While one
                can respect Mr&nbsp;Close’s suggestion the fact is that
                applying the term &quot;centre&quot; to one party does have
                implications, as pointed out succinctly by Ms&nbsp;McWilliams,
                for other parties.</p>

                Ireland Women’s Coalition is somewhat different. The very name
                of the party indicates that it is a coalition of people with
                different designations and that they also need to be given some
                regard.</p>

                this motion — any motion referring to Standing Orders requires
                cross community support — I must call for a recorded vote.
                This requires that an announcement be made that a vote will take
                place in three minutes. It will take place on the basis of roll
                call, because that is the arrangement under the Initial Standing

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The initial Standing Orders give me very
                little flexibility on a whole range of issues. For example, with
                regard to the length of time Members should speak, there is a
                very strong case for some flexibility. The problem is it
                indicates use of this procedure in any decision concerning the
                Standing Orders of the Assembly, even in the case of an interim
                report which makes no recommendations. From my point of view it
                is not a very satisfactory position that there is so little
                flexibility in the interpretation of these Rules. I expect this
                is something that the Standing Orders Committee will wish to
                consider.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would have thought that where there is no

                support. Mr&nbsp;Empey’s point is a good one.</p>

                has to go back and start its work all over again?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is not for me to make an interpretation of
                the meaning of the House’s vote but merely to try to conduct
                it. If there were unanimity then it would be clear that there
                was cross-community support. That is not the same as saying
                there was no one against it. There could be Members who were for
                the motion and other Members who merely abstained — for
                example, if all Members on the Unionist side voted for and all
                Members on the Nationalist side were simply to abstain, there
                would not be cross-community support. If, however, there is
                unanimity of the House then I would certainly accept that there
                would be no need for a recorded vote.</p>

                parties which I have not as yet. We will take one run through on
                that basis. I will try to divide up the balance of the time in
                proportion to the size of the parties and considering the
                request for speaking rights as some parties will have submitted
                very extensive requests, others more limited. I will try to
                achieve the best balance that I can. There may or may not be any
                wind-up speeches, but if there is no desire to wind-up, other
                Members will be allowed to speak in any time remaining.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I trust that is clear, but if it is not I
                will try to explain it further.</p>

                If this afternoon’s debate proceeds for the full three hours

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When we last met in July, I spoke of how our
                community was coming out of a morass of political violence and
                political impotence, and I cautioned then that coming out of
                that morass would not be a simple process. However, none of us
                could have envisaged the carnage and the evil that would be
                perpetrated against our community in the weeks that followed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As we meet today in this splendidly
                refurbished Chamber our thoughts are with those who have lost
                loved ones, those who have been maimed or injured and whose
                faith in humanity, let alone democracy, has been profoundly
                tested. To the Quinn family in Ballymoney, the Kearney family in
                Belfast, the families of those whose lives were so cruelly ended
                in Market&nbsp;Street, Omagh, to those injured there and in
                Banbridge, to the traders of both towns, and to the family of
                the RUC officer, so grievously injured in Portadown, I convey,
                on behalf of all Members, our deepest condolences and
                sympathetic concern.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our thoughts are also with those who so
                admirably served this community during some of our darkest hours
                this summer. To the emergency services — the doctors and the
                nurses in all our hospitals, the members of the
                Royal&nbsp;Ulster Constabulary — and to the countless
                volunteers who sought to help in whatever way possible, we
                express our deepest admiration and gratitude.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The evil deeds that manifest the depravity of
                the few bring out the best in the many. There is an inner
                decency in the community which is the cornerstone of the whole
                democratic process. Thirty years of sectarianism, including the
                most brutal acts of violence, have failed to extinguish the
                light of democracy. There can be only one response which
                reflects the revulsion felt by everyone throughout this island
                to the Omagh atrocity — there can be no place for violence in
                the achievement of political goals.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Initial&nbsp;Presiding Officer, I
                also wish to thank you and all who have worked so hard to
                prepare this building for our use, including the Chamber in
                which we are sitting today. It is a tribute to their efforts and
                a mark of how much they have achieved.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today we are presenting our preliminary
                report on those matters with which we were charged on
                1&nbsp;July. All of us are embarking on one of the most novel
                and challenging journeys in the annals of our democratic system.
                It gives us a historic opportunity to govern with honour and to
                create a Northern&nbsp;Ireland at peace with itself.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have a unique opportunity to develop our
                own Assembly within a rapidly changing United&nbsp;Kingdom and
                in a structured relationship with the Republic of Ireland. We
                must have the confidence to grasp this challenge, to create
                jobs, foster economic prosperity, tackle divisions, and improve
                the quality of life for all. Our community deserves the best
                possible form of government that we can create.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the near future we will be collectively
                accountable for the stewardship of the bulk of the
                £9&nbsp;billion budget currently assigned to the
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland&nbsp;Office. When powers are transferred
                we will have direct responsibility for education, economic
                development, health, housing, transport, the environment and a
                host of other functions. We will have the power to pass
                legislation relating to those devolved matters. We will have the
                power to address the democratic deficit of which quangos are an
                obvious symptom, to create the circumstances within which local
                government can flourish and to work in partnership with the
                business, trade&nbsp;union and voluntary sectors. We will be
                able to set new standards in public administration, and provide
                leadership that will exploit the innate talents and abilities of
                our people.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I envisage the Assembly as a potentially
                powerful force for creating, sustaining and strengthening our
                sense of community and the sense of responsibilities that we
                have for each other; for formulating and implementing a
                programme of government that makes a real difference to people’s
                lives. To do this we must set ourselves a clear goal of
                delivering effective, efficient and quality services to all our
                citizens, and we must ensure that we command their confidence
                and respect. As we begin this debate on the various governmental
                and institutional arrangements stemming from the Agreement, I
                hope that we can put the needs of people first. To do so we need
                a strategic, co-ordinated and integrated approach to government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to thank those who attended our
                initial consultation meetings last week. I look forward to
                receiving their written submissions, elaborating on the matters
                mentioned in those consultations and also containing their views
                on those matters that we simply did not have time to discuss.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am very conscious of the limited timescale,
                not just for last week’s consultation but for the timescale
                within which we have to operate if we are to successfully
                negotiate this transition. The Bill to implement the agreement
                goes back to Parliament in October. The Government hope that it
                will receive the Royal Assent in mid-November.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If there are to be any changes in the number
                of Departments in the Northern Ireland Public Service then an
                Order in Council must be made under the Northern Ireland Act
                1974 although in principle that is something we are not
                comfortable with. But, given the timescale and the need for
                urgency, that is the only realistic way to do it. The Order in
                Council will have to start its parliamentary procedures by the
                end of November if we are to have any hope of achieving the
                transfer of functions in February.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must also remember that the creation of a
                new Department could take up to three months to implement. So,
                if we are to maintain the schedule we must conclude the work on
                our initial view of the Administration’s structure by the
                beginning of November at the latest.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Any restructuring of government should be
                driven by the needs of the public and should reflect the policy
                concerns of the new Administration. In view of the time and cost
                penalties involved, I am sure that none of us should want to
                create new Departments just for the sake of it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">By evolving the policy concerns of the new
                Administration this also has problems. There are a number of
                major policy reviews which have already been put in train by the
                Northern Ireland Office — for example, reviews of health,
                environment and economic matters.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is also the question of the
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland budget. The Northern Ireland Office will
                soon consult with the Assembly about the additional moneys made
                available to Northern Ireland as a result of the Government’s
                own comprehensive spending review. Although the amount of that
                additional money itself reflects policy decisions taken by the
                Government in that review, when the Northern Ireland Office
                settles the Northern Ireland Budget — which it must do in the
                course of the next few months — it will be taking decisions
                that will definitively settle the detailed expenditure in the
                next financial year and also, to a considerable extent settle
                the expenditure for the subsequent two years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These are the first three years in which the
                Assembly will be conducting the Administration, yet there is an
                expectation by the public that the new Assembly and&nbsp;the new
                Administration will make a difference, — and we will want to
                make a difference. Rather than implementing cosmetic policy
                changes in the first year we might do worse than follow the
                example of the present Labour Government by initiating, on a
                tight six to nine-month timescale, our own comprehensive
                spending review and our own comprehensive policy review. We
                would then be taking decisions which we can implement in
                subsequent years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of course, any comprehensive spending or
                policy review may have structural consequences and so whatever
                conclusions we arrive at initially in terms of structures may
                have to be reviewed at a later stage.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a more inflexible timescale with
                regard to the North/South Ministerial Council. Under the terms
                of the agreement the Assembly is set the target of agreeing on
                certain areas of co-operation by 31&nbsp;October.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Northern Ireland Office is planning a
                major investment tour in the United States in October and the
                Deputy First Minister (Designate) and I have been invited to
                take part from 7 to 18 October 1998. If the Assembly is to
                achieve the timescale set out in the agreement, there will have
                to be an inaugural meeting of the North/South Ministerial
                Council towards the end of September or in the first few days of
                October. I am further of the view that substantial business will
                have to be transacted at that meeting. Indeed, I hope it will be
                possible to sign off on some proposals for co-operation at that
                stage.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This, in turn, would require the Assembly to
                give authority, perhaps within a fortnight from now. There is,
                therefore, a grave urgency about looking at areas for
                co-operation in the hope of making considerable progress within
                the timescale. During our discussions there seemed to be
                considerable confusion among other parties about the provisions
                in the agreement for the transitional period. Colleagues seem
                only to be looking at those provisions on the North/South
                Ministerial Council that will apply only after the transitional
                period.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I refer all Members to paragraph 8 of the
                relevant section of the agreement which makes it clear that
                there is adequate authority for what we are proposing to do. The
                Deputy First Minister and I will consider what is put forward in
                this debate. We may consult further with the parties, and we
                will bring forward further proposals as quickly as we can.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Whatever decisions we take, we are now in the
                fortunate position of struggling with democratic, institutional
                arrangements rather than with the politics of the latest
                atrocity. I want, as I have said, this to be a pluralist
                Parliament for a pluralist people in a Northern Ireland in which
                Unionists and Nationalists work together for the benefit of
                everyone.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have welcomed the moves made by those who
                are crossing the bridge from terrorism to democracy. However, as
                in all partnerships, the opportunity to implement the agreement
                in its entirety is predicated on trust and equality. There can
                be neither trust nor equality if any party to the agreement is
                not prepared to destroy its weapons of war. Everyone here should
                rely on votes and not on weaponry. I hope that those previously
                engaged in violence will now embrace peace with a new vigour.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am determined to make the agreement work.
                However, I simply cannot reconcile the seeking of positions in
                Government with a failure to discharge responsibilities, under
                the agreement, to dismantle terrorist organisations. The
                agreement cannot work unless it all works. In presenting this
                report, I am noting the work completed so far in implementing
                part of the agreement. We, and the Ulster Unionist Party, will
                continue doing what is needed to make the agreement work. Let us
                all do what we all need to do to make all of the agreement work.

                something which is at odds with the violence and the brutality
                that we saw then. That is a challenge that the Assembly must
                accept, a challenge which we have taken on ourselves and is a
                challenge that we must work to meet.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is a more difficult challenge, because
                communities that maintain conflict have no problem with
                understanding. An eye-for-an-eye culture does not demand any
                great comprehension. For a community to overcome conflict is
                much more complex. Respect and trust are not built in an
                instant.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Equality, while it does need laws and
                constitutions to protect it against abuse, is not built in any
                Parliament or by any legislation. It is built on the streets and
                involves dismantling past barriers, promoting tolerance and
                developing understanding and above all creating space for
                everyone of us to be inclusive of the other.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have a very substantial institutional
                challenge here. For years we decried direct rule. We talked
                about democratic deficits. We criticised those who made
                decisions. At times we were right — probably most time we were
                right — but now we do not have any escape hatch. There are no
                bolt-holes. It is for us now to assume the responsibility of
                making those decisions. We have to move from criticism to
                construction, from making demands to making choices, from
                claiming rights to taking responsibilities for our own lives. We
                have to decide how in this Assembly we create not just those
                institutions but the attitudes of minds in the community which
                will underpin those institutions and make them work to their
                maximum advantage.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A new politics has begun. It is time for
                responsibility and commitment, a time for service to
                people&nbsp;— to those who elected us, to those who resolve to
                make this agreement work and to those who themselves have not
                yet resolved to do so. We in the Assembly have to make sure that
                we do it in a way that is people-orientated. We have to harness
                all the advantages we have here, and we have to deal with the
                disadvantages that we have facing all of us.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the First Minister (Designate) and I met
                with parties, certain things struck both of us. We saw strengths
                and capabilities in the parties, a very constructive impatience
                to resume responsibility, real concern about what was happening
                in the community and an understanding of the socio-economic
                problems that all of us have to face. There was a unique
                connectedness between the political parties and those who
                elected them here — probably, in a sense, more immediate and
                potentially more dynamic than one would find in most other
                countries.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our discussions and consultations centred
                mainly on the creation of Departments, not exclusively but
                primarily, because it was the first item on the agenda. Many
                parties gave very differing views, but there were factors that
                were shared. One was the absolute need to create Departments
                that were effective of themselves and could make the maximum
                contribution to the administrative life here and which could
                deal with those issues which interlock and transcend
                Departments. Some of them spring readily to mind — for
                example, how we handle European matters, how we handle the
                equality agenda, and how we deal with some issues that run
                through Departments and are the responsibility of all.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There was almost the unique agreement that we
                did not want any Departmental silos, that we could not have a
                situation, where there were six, seven, eight, nine or 10
                floating Ministries acting independently, that there had to be a
                collective view that in any Executive formed would be dealing
                with one budget, with one governmental approach, and that there
                could be no luxuries of sitting outside of that.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.30 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We also had deep discussions about the
                North/South Ministerial Council. As one would be aware there
                were different emphases and different attitudes in relation to
                that. But again there was this common strand: what we decide
                upon after further consultation will be that which is of mutual
                benefit to the people in Ireland, North and South.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We will not be building ivory towers just to
                keep Nationalism happy, but something meaningful in terms of the
                economic, social and cultural life of all of this island. That
                view also extended into the British/Irish Council, which gives
                us all a unique opportunity to explore and develop the totality
                of relationships between these islands, a cliché that has been
                used for years we now have an opportunity to turn into a
                political reality.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some of those areas for consideration are
                self evident. Transport for an island country such as ours must
                be one. The currency, common or otherwise, through which our
                industry will deal, must surely be something that will interest
                the North/South Council.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The final area that we were charged to
                consult about and report back on was the creation of a
                consultative Forum. I am pleased at the remarkable interest
                there has been in that body. That is not just something typed in
                the agreement. Given the amount of interest that we have seen,
                it is something that is organic, and it must be organic, organic
                in the sense that while it relates to the Assembly uniquely,
                above that it relates to the community that the Assembly serves,
                equally uniquely.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Forum must not be a resting place for
                those on the way down, or for those on the way up, as such
                bodies sometimes are. It should not be a place for the great and
                the good in society who almost seek to have an automatic
                interest in bodies like these. It will be the success that we
                can make it when we see people from every walk of life, from
                every political view and from every social and economic class in
                that body contributing with us to a resolution of the many
                problems that we have.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We look forward to further consultation —
                more in depth and more decisive consultation — and we will do
                that with speed. And the consultation should be in the same
                spirit as this consultation took place. We must show that all
                Members of the Chamber do take seriously what we have said for
                years about the contribution that local politics in the North of
                Ireland should make to our lives.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I finish on this note. There are many
                divergent people with many divergent views in this Chamber. It
                will be the strength of that diversity that will actually be a
                creative, moving force in the working of the Assembly, its
                Executive and the North/South Ministerial Council, and in
                relation to the British/Irish Council as well. It will be the
                motive fulcrum that will allow people on the ground to look at
                this place and say &quot;Ah they are serious. There is a new
                politic — not a politic of bickering; not a politic of
                sectarianism; not a politic of one doing the other down and
                getting the better of every argument and every decision, but a
                new politic.&quot; And that new politic will be absolutely
                impotent unless it can harness the involvement, the creativity
                and the imagination of everyone here.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister (Designate) and I look
                forward to that challenge. We can fulfil that challenge only if
                we all do it together, and together, we can succeed if we do it
                for the people who need it most — the people whom we
                represent, living across the length and breadth of Northern
                Ireland.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Empey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All of us welcome the opportunity of turning
                our minds to the task at hand of establishing the right
                structures for the future Administration of Northern Ireland.
                Many Members may not be aware that the Civil Service is
                currently going through one of the largest changes in its
                history. It is having to completely change its accounting
                procedures to create a balance sheet for the activities which it
                performs on a department to department basis; administratively,
                this is time-consuming and is imposing colossal strains on the
                Service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There have been various hints in the press as
                to how many departments there will be. Will there be six, 10,
                15? All sorts of numbers have been quoted.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition there are somewhere between 111
                and 145 quangos — I do not know the exact number, but it is
                certainly large. Some of them are spending colossal sums of
                money; they are very large administrations in their own right,
                and it would be wrong if this Assembly were to simply create an
                additional administrative tier. Whatever we are facing, we face
                enormous change.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am strongly of the view that we must not
                rush helter-skelter into creating new Departments without fully
                appreciating the implications. Neither can we allow the system
                to carry on as it is; we cannot allow ourselves to be suffocated
                by one review after another. If we decide to increase the number
                of departments or create new ones out of existing ones, the
                truth is that we will be spending large amounts of money in
                perpetuity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If, say, it costs between £500,000 and
                £13,000,000 or £14,000,000 to set up a new Department from
                scratch, that is money which will come out of the Northern
                Ireland budget every year — not a one-off piece of
                expenditure. We have got to translate that into schools,
                hospitals and roads that will not be built, into economic
                development and initiatives that will not be taken.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unless we are making compensatory savings in
                other areas of the administration, all we are doing is
                increasing the burden of government on the community, and that
                is not what I believe we are here to do.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have been equally concerned at the
                arbitrary way in which some people have said &quot;Oh, we will
                just have 10&quot; or &quot;we arrived at this figure on a ‘snouts
                in the trough’ basis&quot; or &quot;There is a mention of up
                to 10 in the agreement&quot;. The question is: what is needed?
                What is appropriate? What is right at this point in time? And we
                also have to be aware that we are being asked to do, in a few
                weeks, what our colleagues in Scotland and Wales are being
                allowed to take years to do. A tremendous burden is being
                imposed upon us and I for one do not wish to see us go ram-stam
                into something purely to make up the numbers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have also got to get away from this idea
                that if you have a Minister you must have a Department — that
                is not necessarily the case. It is perfectly conceivable to have
                Ministers who do not have Departments, who have
                cross-departmental responsibility, who could, for instance, have
                responsibility for piloting legislation. There is a range of
                things that we must look at.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to other parts of the structure
                — be they the North/South Ministerial Council, the
                British/Irish Council, and so on — we are getting very
                positive indications from Scotland and Wales of a willingness to
                do business with the Northern&nbsp;Ireland Assembly. There have
                been communications from political representatives over there
                who are anxious to engage with us, and some of them have even
                given us ideas as to what issues we might pursue. That is also
                the case with the North/South Ministerial Council.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have to see this within the context of the
                European Union and growing regionalisation. If we had not opted
                for devolution in this province, we would have been left out of
                the major constitutional change that is taking place in the rest
                of the United Kingdom, change which is not confined to Scotland
                and Wales — London is shortly to get its own Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I heard on the radio at the weekend that
                representatives of the North-East of England have already formed
                themselves into groups. The North-West is doing the same. The
                South-West, at local government level, has an embryonic
                structure in place. There is this pattern of devolving powers
                because the United Kingdom and, indeed, the Republic of Ireland
                are the two most centralised states in the European Union, and
                that situation is not sustainable in the long term.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Equally I am very pleased that we have
                decided today to appoint an ad&nbsp;hoc Committee to look into
                our relationship with the House of Commons. There are major
                issues there which go back, as Mr&nbsp;Robinson mentioned, to
                the &quot;West&nbsp;Lothian&quot; question, and that touches on
                very sensitive constitutional issues.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should not be a stand-alone instrument
                here. The House of Commons has power under the Act to make laws
                for the whole of the United Kingdom, so we will still have to
                look very closely at the relationship that exists between
                ourselves and Westminster.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have complained about quangos year in and
                year out for decades, and the future of some of the larger ones
                will have to be examined very closely. What is the future for
                bodies like the health boards, the Health and Social Services
                Council and the education boards? We had prolonged debate in the
                last couple of years about the education boards, many people
                wanting to retain the existing number. But is it conceivable
                that we would have an Assembly and a legislature here, yet
                retain those bodies? I think not.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We run the risk of sending the administration
                of this province into turmoil and placing question marks over
                everything. I fear that it is not going to be possible to make
                an omelette without breaking some eggs. I also suggest that
                people who are working for those bodies, people who are sitting
                on those bodies, will have to realise that major change is going
                to take place.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Perhaps Mr&nbsp;Empey will give the Assembly
                his opinion on the chances of an Executive being formed. At a
                meeting with the Security Minister here on
                6&nbsp;August&nbsp;1998 he said that as things stood then the
                Ulster Unionist Party would not have endorsed the agreement and
                no Executive could have been formed. Other members of his party
                insisted that the voters were wavering and that there was a real
                risk of civil war. What exactly is he saying today?</p>

                intervention, but I will give the Member an answer if he wishes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unlike his party’s position, which as
                enunciated at the weekend, is that it is prepared to take seats
                in Government irrespective of whether there is decommissioning
                or not, the Ulster Unionist Party’s position is that it is not

                party and the Ulster Unionist Party is that he enunciated at the
                weekend that the Democratic Unionist Party is prepared to take
                its seats in the Government without a qualification that
                decommissioning must be involved; that is the difference between
                the two parties.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope you will allow me time for the
                interventions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We wish to ensure maximum cost-benefit and
                effectiveness in any changes we make. We must therefore be sure
                that they are based on solid judgements; that there is a
                strategy behind what we do; and that that strategy flows into
                policy. Therefore we will have to review policy and realise that
                there is a relationship between policy and structure. It is
                always easy to keep the system that already exists.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While I have no desire to change out of all
                recognition what has been an effective system, we nevertheless
                have to make it more responsive. Any changes will have to be
                made as efficiently and as cost-effectively as possible because
                if we spend money on administration we remove money from public
                services.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Empey asked whether further time will
                be allowed in respect of interventions. I must advise that no
                further time will be made available. I hope this will not
                discourage Members from permitting interventions, but if they
                permit extensive interventions the whole proceedings are
                disrupted. I have to rule that interventions are time lost from
                a speech, although interventions may, of course, contribute to
                it.</p>

                he has no way of knowing whether it is going to be a long or
                short intervention. If interventions look as though they are
                going to be lengthy it would be helpful if the Chair ensured
                that they are curtailed.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hume:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I begin by expressing my deep appreciation to
                the First Minister (Designate) and his Deputy, not only for the
                detailed work they have done since taking office but for the
                Interim Report which they have placed before us. Their work and
                the Report represent the challenge of a new beginning and the
                leaving behind of a terrible past.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This new beginning challenges us to put into
                operation new democratic institutions. These will be shared
                institutions allowing both sections of the community to work
                together on common interests, bringing government much closer to
                the people. People are the only wealth we have, for without them
                any piece of earth is only a jungle. Therefore it is right and
                proper that government and the decision-making process should be
                as close to the people as possible. It is our duty in the
                Assembly to do everything we can to ensure that that happens as
                soon as possible.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should also be deciding as soon as
                possible what Government Departments we are going to have. There
                are six at present, but there are differences of opinion among
                parties about how many Departments and Ministerial portfolios
                there should be. Decisions also need to be taken about a civic
                forum and the proposals for areas of co-operation under the
                North/South body and the British/Irish Council. I would
                therefore appeal to all parties, in consultation with the First
                Minister (Designate) and Deputy First Minister (Designate), to
                reach agreement in those areas as soon as possible so that this
                institution can get down to the serious work of government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we do not get down to that work, this
                Assembly will become — and we can see it happening already —
                not just a talking shop about our past, but a &quot;shouting
                shop&quot; about our past. We want to leave that past behind us,
                because we all know the terrible price that all sections of our
                people have paid for that past.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The challenge before us now is to create the
                new beginning, to implement the agreement that the people have
                so overwhelmingly endorsed and to implement it in all its
                detail, which means creating the democratic institutions to
                allow all sections of our people to work together with respect
                for one another, and to build a completely new society.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr Ian Paisley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a great weakness in this discussion
                today. When my party met the First Minister (Designate) and the
                Deputy First Minister (Designate), we found that they were
                divided on the question of the Executive. At the first meeting
                of the Assembly, I said that we were perfectly clear in our
                minds about the position of the Deputy First Minister
                (Designate); he had made his position crystal clear. We are not
                clear about the position of the First Minister (Designate), and
                in our discussions it was quite clear that there was a
                difference between these two gentlemen.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If I understand anything about this
                agreement, it is that it is based on a partnership between these
                two gentlemen, in which they have a common purpose, a common
                task and a common objective. But how can they have that when
                they are not in agreement?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Representatives of the Official Unionist
                Party ask, inside and outside this House, what my party is going
                to do. That does not matter. They have taken the position of
                First Minister (Designate), and they have a responsibility now
                to tell the House what their attitude is to these questions. Are
                they prepared to sit down with IRA/Sinn Fein in a Government of
                Northern Ireland? What about decommissioning and what about the
                release of prisoners? They must make their position clear on all
                these matters.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What we have had today is not consultation
                because they have not told us what they intend to do. In any
                parliamentary consultation process there is a Green Paper and
                then a White Paper. A Green Paper sets out the alternatives, and
                then a White Paper indicates the mind of the Government. These
                two gentlemen owe it to the Assembly to set out their position
                clearly and in writing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have heard Mr Empey speculating about the
                number of Departments we should have, but we cannot have real
                consultation until the First Minister (Designate) and the Deputy
                First Minister (Designate) tell us what they propose. The first
                step in consultation is for them to say &quot;These are the
                alternatives. We are choosing this alternative, and we want to
                know your attitude to it.&quot; What have they in mind in
                setting up this Executive?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to know whether the First
                Minister (Designate) and Deputy First Minister (Designate)
                believe that they can form the strand of a North/South Council
                when no Executive is in place? The Assembly needs to know.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I see the First Minister raising his copy of
                this agreement. I know what it says. It says that they can lead
                it, but it does not say that they can make it. Of course, he
                would say that he and the Deputy First Minister are going to
                make up the North/South Council, and then there will be a very
                cosy relationship with Mr&nbsp;Ahern and his colleagues — very
                cosy indeed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, there are some Members in this House
                who want to have some say about what is happening with regard to
                cosy relationships with the Irish Republic. I ask the First
                Minister (Designate) to come clean on that. We want to know what
                is in his mind and that of the Deputy First Minister (Designate)
                as to what they intend to do about this and what are they going
                to do about the Unionist Party’s attitude to these things
                which is on record in the reply to the Member for East Belfast.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The all-important question is: when is this
                Assembly going to have a piece of paper from the First Minister
                (Designate) and Deputy First Minister (Designate) saying
                &quot;this is the way we think the Assembly should go&quot;? We
                heard a suggestion from the First Minister (Designate) that he
                would like us to write to him and the Deputy First Minister
                (Designate) with proposals. But the point is that they know the
                views of those they have talked to about many of these things.
                Now they have to make up their minds and declare their intent.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are many other matters of concern —
                for instance, the Civic Forum. In the House of Commons I said
                that it was going to be the great monster quango. I notice that
                the voluntary bodies do not want any elected person to have any
                say in it. Because they cannot get elected themselves, they feel
                that all elected Members should have no say. They talk about
                using the Senate Chamber so we will have a quasi House of Lords
                attached to this House. They are going to be the grand
                itinerants. They are going to go from county to county and from
                place to place.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We also had the suggestion in the House of
                Commons, in an amendment from the Social Democratic and Labour
                Party, that the First Minister (Designate) and the Deputy First
                Minister (Designate) should be the people to choose the members
                of this body and that the Assembly should have no say whatsoever
                in the matter. Any body should have the imprimatur of this House
                upon it. We are the elected representatives; we are the people
                that were sent here to represent the people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We do not need this monster quango. We do not
                need another tier to this Assembly. This is the place where
                elected representatives should have their say and should make
                their wishes known. If people want to lobby this body, they can
                lobby it. If people want to make representation to this body,
                they can make it. However, to have an outside body with a wider
                remit than the Assembly is certainly not going to lead to good
                government in Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These are the matters I believe this House
                should be considering and I look forward to the day when we get
                the piece of paper which outlines the direction in which the
                First Minister (Designate) and Deputy First Minister (Designate)
                believe we should go.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.00 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister (Designate) has made a
                speech that has been strong in description, strong in the
                parliamentary diary, strong in what the Government need to do
                and strong in what we need to do. But we have not had one firm
                suggestion about the number of Departments he thinks we should
                have. Is he prepared to sit on an Executive with IRA/Sinn Fein?
                He has not answered that question, and those are matters that
                the Assembly needs to consider.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The sooner we come to the crux of this
                matter, the better for us all. Let us get it out in the open and
                see what the major differences are between the First Minister
                (Designate) and his deputy. Let us see what they are and if they
                are going to handle this matter in a parliamentary way, so that
                we will know — it will be written down — exactly what they
                are going to do.</p>

                an-tábhachtach atá sa lá seo. Tá sé tábhachtach mar tá
                seans againne ár stair nua a chur le chéile. Bhí samhradh
                millteanach againn. Mar sin, tá súil agamsa agus tá súil ag
                Sinn Féin go rachaidh muid ar aghaidh uaidh seo amach. Ar son
                Sinn Féin ba mhaith liom a rá go ndéanfaidh muid ár
                ndícheall an stair nua a chur le chéile.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is very important that we see today as a
                chance to make new history. I noted Dr Paisley, the absentee,
                occasionally present Leader of the Democratic Unionist Party
                stressing in his submission that he wants to find out what the
                differences are between what the Deputy First Minister
                (Designate) and the First Minister (Designate) are saying. We
                who have vested interest in the future – Dr Paisley has a
                great future, and it is behind him — can make this work if we
                work together.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now, what do we want to make work? The Good
                Friday Agreement is very clear. The Assembly cannot exist
                without all the other inter-dependent and inter-related
                institutions, whether it is the Executive, the all-Ireland body,
                the implementation bodies, the British/Irish Council or the
                policy making bodies. Therefore, when I thank the First Minister
                (Designate) and Deputy First Minister (Designate) for the
                report, I have to say that they do need to expedite the content
                of it. The Good Friday Agreement is very clear about all these
                matters including the timetable. It is also very — and I am
                sure everyone here is conversant with it — clear about the
                issue of executive authority.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What Sinn Fein wants to see in place are real
                Departments — the present Departments clearly do not work.
                They are confusing and in many ways incoherent. We have made
                written submissions to the report which we received as the
                precursor of this report, and we will do so again. In terms of
                consultation it is important that we understand that the First
                and Deputy First Ministers (Designate) cannot forever represent
                the Assembly. All the parties present here have an automatic
                right to take their places in the Executive and from there in
                the Council of Ministers, and so on.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I had written a speech to be made two years
                ago at the point when our party was excluded from the
                negotiations and in it I was going to say</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;I believe that Ian Paisley and David
                Trimble, with whom I have many disagreements but who care about
                their people, can with the rest of us do a much better job
                running our economy, looking after our Health Service, our
                elderly, our young, and our urban and rural communities. We do
                not need British Ministers. The people of this island have the
                right and the ability to govern ourselves.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As an Irish Republican I want to see a
                situation in which the five million people of this island can
                shape our futures, combat poverty and bring about a whole system
                of equality and justice.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I know that Unionists and Republicans have
                inflicted great hurt upon each other. I hear the catcalls from
                the other Bench, and the gap between us is not just the space of
                floor which is between us. I want to make friends with Dr
                Paisley and with those whom he represents. But unless we have a
                sense of doing this together, then not only will this, as Mr
                Hume said, be reduced to a shouting shop, but the people who
                depend on us to take us all out of 30&nbsp;years of division,
                the conflict of partition and all the other discriminations and
                injustices will be very sorely disappointed, and Sinn Fein does
                not intend to disappoint them.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Neeson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am very pleased to be back in this Chamber
                today, and I want to pay tribute to all those who were
                responsible for its restoration and reconstruction. I remember
                standing almost on this very spot, almost 16 years ago at the
                opening day of the 1982 Assembly, and the big difference between
                then and now is that in 1982 the Social Democratic and Labour
                Party and Sinn Fein, for their own reasons, had decided not to
                participate. But today all those who were elected to the
                Assembly are sitting here around the table to start a new
                Government, a new chance for the people of Northern Ireland. And
                I applaud that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They say that life depends on the survival of
                the&nbsp;fittest. That is certainly the case in political life.
                From those heady days in 1982 I am
                pleased&nbsp;to&nbsp;see&nbsp;here today Mr&nbsp;Taylor,
                Mr&nbsp;Davis, Mr&nbsp;McCartney, Mr&nbsp;Bell,
                Mr&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;Robinson, Dr&nbsp;Paisley,
                Rev&nbsp;William&nbsp;McCrea, the young Jim&nbsp;Wells and last
                but not least Mr&nbsp;Close. I am delighted that these people
                are still around to participate in the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regards to the numerical makeup of the
                new Shadow Executive and the development of the new Departments,
                Alliance is clearly committed to the establishment of 10
                Departments, and I will tell you why later. But I am somewhat
                concerned by the motivation of some of the people who want only
                six or seven Departments. Is it for the effectiveness or the
                efficiency of the new Government in Northern&nbsp;Ireland, or is
                this another political motive aimed at reducing the numbers from
                other parties who get seats on the Executive? We in Alliance
                accept that we will not be getting a ministerial seat, but it
                would concern me if political agendas rather than the effective
                and efficient operation of the Assembly were to determine the
                number of Executive posts.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We see clear opportunities arising from the
                restructuring of Departments — for example, the Department of
                the Environment is much too large and there have been problems
                with public transport for instance. There are certainly
                arguments to be made in support of the suggestions contained in
                the annex circulated to us.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We also have the equality issue, which to me
                does not just mean religious equality. One of the concerns I
                expressed when the Equal Opportunities Commission was
                established, was that issues such as gender, disability or race
                would be overshadowed by the issue of religious equality.
                However, the establishment of a Department for Equality will
                give this Assembly the opportunity to ensure that there is true
                equality for all the people of Northern Ireland. I also see a
                role for the Community Relations Council in this.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The topic of heritage is a great personal
                interest of mine, and I would commend the proposals for a
                Department of Arts, Culture, Heritage and Sport. This could also
                consider the promotion of tourism in Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Alliance Party is currently consulting
                with other parties in the Assembly to see how the tenth
                Department could be established. We are strongly pro-Europe, and
                believe there is an opportunity, if junior Ministries are to be
                created, to appoint a junior Minister with responsibility for
                European issues. That person’s responsibilities might include
                the East/West institutions as well as the Northern Ireland
                Bureau in Washington. I see a need for someone to deal with
                those issues. Clearly, we need to move this process forward
                urgently and reach decisions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Paisley is right to say that there must be
                full consultation with all the Assembly parties when the First
                Minister (Designate) and the Deputy First Minister (Designate)
                are making their final decisions. I hope there will be a further
                meeting, given the shortness of the meeting we had the last
                time. There is certainly a need for further consultation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important that the proposed Civic Forum
                truly reflects civil society in Northern Ireland, and not, as
                the Deputy First Minister (Designate) stated, just &quot;the
                great and the good&quot;, whom many of us have seen posturing
                around on various platforms over the years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Time is of the essence, and I hope that all
                the parties in the Assembly will assist the First Minister
                (Designate) and the Deputy First Minister (Designate) to come to
                decisions quickly on these matters. Let us ensure that we meet
                the demands of our timetable.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCartney:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has been much talk of democracy,
                particularly from the First Minister (Designate) and the Deputy
                First Minister (Designate). They have given voice to lofty
                aspirations about peace, justice and equality. All democrats
                would share such aspirations. However, there has been a lack of
                consideration about the foundations upon which the Assembly will
                be built.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ostensibly, we are here to discuss the
                &quot;above-ground&quot; structures — the Executive, the
                portfolios, the number of Ministers. But we should start by
                looking at the democratic foundations upon which these
                structures will be built, and, in a democracy those foundations
                cannot conceivably include those who are in any sense wedded to
                the principle that violence in the pursuit of political
                objectives can in some circumstances be justified.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is the defining principle upon which the
                Assembly should consider erecting any structures.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was noticeable that, while the
                First&nbsp;Minister (Designate) made what some might call
                &quot;a hairy-chested&quot; assertion that there could be no
                question of parties sitting down in an Executive with those who
                were associated with or intertwined with those possessing
                weapons, that topic was totally absent from the address of the
                Deputy First&nbsp;Minister (Designate).</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly has also heard about the
                importance of the First Minister (Designate) and the Deputy
                First Minister (Designate) discussing with their counterparts in
                the Republic — as part of the North/South Ministerial Council
                — the sort of all-Ireland implementation bodies that are to be
                created. However there has been no hint of what those
                implementation bodies will do.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members have, of course, been told that, on
                the one hand, these bodies will be relatively
                &quot;Mickey&nbsp;Mouse&quot; affairs, concerned with teacher
                training, animal husbandry, hygiene and, possibly, tourism.
                However, the Deputy First&nbsp;Minister (Designate) has more
                substantial powers in mind. In yesterday’s ‘Sunday&nbsp;Tribune’
                he stated</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;the significance of the North/South
                Ministerial Council is not symbolic; it is practical: its role
                will be to deliver real benefits for both parts of the
                island.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So far so good.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;There can be no real argument any more
                about the potential benefits of a one island approach across the
                spectrum of economic and social issues. It must benefit the
                people of Northern&nbsp;Ireland to be able to tap-in to, and to
                link up with, the most successful economy in Europe this
                decade&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is a totally erroneous statement, and
                very soon the four legs — and possibly the tail as well —
                may come off the &quot;Celtic&nbsp;tiger&quot;. Be that as it
                may, that is an expression of opinion. It is clear that the
                Deputy First&nbsp;Minister (Designate) sees these bodies as
                being of real importance.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Once you have the economy and the social
                structures for delivering the social services of two countries
                completely intertwined and united, you have effectively a united
                country. That is the vision of the Deputy First&nbsp;Minister
                (Designate). It is not apparently the vision of the
                First&nbsp;Minister (Designate). These are anomalies that will
                have to be resolved.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But let us look at the timetable for this. I
                happen to share with the Leader of Sinn Fein the view that the
                first priority of the two Ministers, and of this Assembly, is to
                appoint an Executive. When that Executive is appointed —
                whether it comprises 10&nbsp;Ministers or seven&nbsp;Ministers
                — those Ministers will have to be appointed in accordance with
                the d’Hondt principle.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Under the terms of this agreement, all
                parties that qualify under the d’Hondt principle will be
                entitled to take their seats, including Sinn Fein. In relation
                to decommissioning Sinn Fein is only required to do nothing more
                than use such influence as it may have with those organisations
                said to be associated with it and who are in possession of
                weapons.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was upon that principle, among others,
                that I opposed the agreement. But that is the agreement, and
                there is much strength in the suggestion that the
                First&nbsp;Minister (Designate) is now attempting to shut the
                stable door after the horse has gone.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On democratic grounds Sinn Fein ought not to
                be entitled to take Executive positions in the Government while
                it remains inextricably linked with an organisation that refuses
                to decommission. But that is not what the agreement says. This
                is a fundamental issue which will have to be resolved. It
                suggests that the two Ministers will arrange some, if not all of
                the implementation bodies in the agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are not told what those implementation
                bodies will be decreed to do. However, the Assembly will have to
                give its consent to the Ministers plan, and Members will be told
                that unless they accept these implementation bodies, under the
                principle of mutuality this Assembly will fail and with it will
                go the blue carpet, the plush chairs, the emoluments, and the
                facilities. That will be the price for saying &quot;no&quot; to
                the implementation bodies proposed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those implementation bodies are being
                proposed out of chronological sequence as it appears on this
                document. The first item that the Ministers were charged to deal
                with was</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;the basic structures including the
                agreement on the number of Ministerial posts, and the
                distribution of executive responsibilities between those
                posts&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Then there was</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;the preparation for establishing the
                British/Irish Council and the North/South Ministerial Council,
                and associated implementation bodies&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Why are the roles being reversed? They are
                being reversed because the First Minister (Designate) does not
                believe that his party will sanction sitting down with Sinn Fein
                as joint members of an executive, while the IRA has not
                decommissioned any of its weapons. He believes that if he
                reverses the role, he may persuade his party to back him and
                give him authority to agree all-Ireland implementation bodies at
                the price of not losing their positions. Everyone who claims to
                be a democrat will have to think about his personal interest,
                emoluments, or facilities will be the price that will have to be
                paid for agreeing to do something which as a Unionist,
                regardless of his party, he ought not to do.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to return to the question of
                being able to change designation. The issue was made clear by
                Ms&nbsp;Morrice when she said that her party was charged with
                protecting the agreement. If a majority of Unionists vote for
                some matter that may cause the agreement to be put at issue, the
                Women’s Coalition Members are saying that they would become
                Unionists for the day in order to frustrate a true Unionist
                majority vote on that issue. In other words the agreement would
                be placed above the principles of democratic representation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I believe that this Assembly will fail unless
                it is based on the solid foundation of democracy. I do not
                disagree with the entitlement of Mr&nbsp;Adams, Mr&nbsp;McGuinness
                and all the other members of Sinn Fein to forcefully,
                politically and democratically, advance their ideal of a united
                socialist Irish Republic. What I fundamentally disagree with is
                that they should directly or tacitly or in a hidden way, be
                associated with the threat of violence, if this process does not
                deliver progress in that direction.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My remarks are equally applicable to any
                other party. I specifically mention the Progressive Unionist
                Party which is in a similar position in relation to an armed
                organisation. In regard to this matter my feelings towards them
                are exactly the same as my feelings towards Sinn Fein. Democracy
                must prevail, and there must be no particle of violence or the
                threat of violence of any kind in the basis upon which we erect
                the structures and institutions of government for
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the Leader of the United Kingdom
                Unionist Party said that he agreed with Mr&nbsp;Adams, members
                of the press left the Gallery — I think they wanted to get to
                a microphone but they should have waited until I spoke. They
                would have been shocked to hear that I happen to agree with
                Mr&nbsp;McCartney’s position that Sinn Fein has a legal right
                to get into the Executive without decommissioning.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What we need to concentrate on — <i>[Interruption]</p>

                behaviour of some Members.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has been a lot of talk about taking
                time to ensure that we do not make any mistakes. Before we had
                this Assembly, and even while we were moving to this building, I
                heard a lot of discussion about the Civil Service and about the
                amount of power that it had been given because of direct rule.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Progressive Unionist Party believes that
                there need to be 10 Ministers and 10 Departments, because the
                agreement says that we need to represent society. If we do not
                have these Ministers and Departments, we will not be able to
                provide recognition for all the people who make up our society.
                We also believe that it needs to be done quickly for that very
                reason. We need to get rid of the status quo and show people
                that this is a new beginning.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need to ensure that those Departments can
                deliver a service to the people. We should not sit here for the
                next two years, doing exactly what the Labour Government are
                doing now, or what the Tory Government did before them for 17
                years. They made lots of mistakes, and we have an opportunity to
                put those mistakes right. We know the problems in this Province.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We know that only the top 20% of our young
                people get a decent education. Many of us represent
                working-class areas where education is disadvantaged, and we
                need to change that. Sinn Fein Members have to realise that
                their people do not have a monopoly on disadvantage or
                deprivation. When we get to the equality agenda, Sinn Fein and
                the Social Democratic and Labour Party will have to recognise
                that we also have problems, not only in terms of socio-economic
                issues, but in terms of our culture.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is why we need to ensure that we get
                these Departments right. We also need to make sure that the
                delivery mechanisms and the programmes are right. We support
                Junior Ministers, because we believe that they could push these
                programmes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We hope that other Members will support us in
                this. We need to move as quickly as possible to make any headway
                before Christmas. The parties have been around for a long time,
                and they know the issues. They should also know the Departments
                that are needed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not sure that the economic argument is
                one that stands up. There are opportunities already mentioned by
                the First Minister (Designate), in terms of the Chancellor’s
                money. Is the money additional or not? If it is additional, how
                can we use it? We should not be worried because we will have a
                Minister with the departmental responsibilities. Then we have to
                pay for civil servants. If the money is delivered to people on
                the ground, and the intervention is at the right level, let us
                do it. Let us not waste money but make sure we spend it
                correctly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In terms of the Departments, who is going to
                be given the &quot;poisoned chalice&quot; of Health? We do not
                have that problem. We can sit back in constructive Opposition
                and criticise when mistakes are made. It will be interesting to
                see who gets it – and we hope that he gets it right. We hope
                he does better than those before him did.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Progressive Unionist Party believes that
                in all parties in this Assembly there are people who would be
                quite capable of taking on the ministerial and junior
                ministerial roles, and while we will not be out to criticise
                those people we will make sure that they do their jobs and where
                necessary we will provide constructive criticism. We recognise
                that over the summer months the First Minister (Designate) and
                Deputy First (Designate) Minister did not have the time to do
                the necessary amount of consultation work, but let us hope that
                in the next few weeks it can be done quickly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Progressive Unionist Party will certainly
                be proposing that there be 10 Ministers and 10 Departments, and
                we will be outlining them in great detail. I hope that the First
                Minister (Designate) and Deputy First Minister (Designate) will
                pay as much attention to our paper as they will to those of the
                larger parties.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms McWilliams:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Northern Ireland Women’s Coalition
                Party welcomes this opportunity to respond to the report by the
                Deputy First Minister (Designate) and First Minister
                (Designate). We have relied on an unaccountable form of
                Administration for too many years, but now we have the
                opportunity to take accountability for our own future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Much work is required to mould this new
                Government and Administration, and it needs to be done both
                strategically and collectively. However, we could move so fast
                that we do not take enough time to look at continuity and what
                needs to be put in place. This is the difficulty we face in
                building these new Departments. We have to ask ourselves what
                was there before, what worked and what did not work; and what
                must we now put in place that could possibly work.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr&nbsp;Paisley mentioned the Civic Forum,
                which is preceded by the word &quot;consultative&quot;. Who
                could possibly see it as a disbenefit to the Assembly that we
                consult? There are many trade unionists, business people and
                members of civil society currently implementing structures in
                health, education and in the world of sport and the arts who
                would be only too glad to lend themselves to that consultation
                process. We have a responsibility as elected Members to consult
                them on how they see the way forward.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the Deputy First Minister (Designate)
                talked about our rights, he was correct to also point out our
                responsibilities. We have a right to put these Departments in
                place, and we have the responsibility to ensure that they work.
                The people of Northern Ireland know only too well that one does
                not constantly demand one’s rights without taking one’s
                responsibilities just as seriously.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another huge responsibility for us is that of
                putting the community to the fore rather than our own party
                political needs. In response to Mr&nbsp;McCartney’s point, may
                I say that my Colleague, Ms&nbsp;Morrice, was not just
                protecting the agreement in a partisan fashion; she was
                protecting the agreement in its totality. No matter whether she
                feels on any given occasion that representing a Nationalist part
                of the community or a Unionist part of the community, she tasks
                herself with the larger job of representing all of the
                community. That is the responsibility which we now have.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have currently a number of Departments
                with high expenditure and large policy units. These need to be
                looked at. The Deputy First Minister (Designate) has suggested
                that we should look at integrated policies across all the
                Departments. The issues of equality, human rights and
                reconciliation need to be looked at with regard to integration.
                It is, however, such a large portfolio that it may need its own
                ministry. It struck me very forcefully on entering the Building
                today that there was a table to my right which carried the
                legend &quot;Strangers&quot;. I thought &quot;Who are they
                talking about? Are they talking about the Members of this House
                who do not know each other or about the people who are coming
                for one day?&quot;. I think the Department that deals with
                equality, human rights and reconciliation will have to consider
                the issue of &quot;strangers&quot;.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are other issues we have never had to
                deal with before which we will now have to tackle. What do the
                victims in society need? There was not time when negotiating the
                agreement to deal with that question. After our most painful and
                cruel summer we now need to look at it as a serious resource
                issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the issue of children and young people,
                Government Departments were established before issues of child
                abuse or violence against women and children were recognised as
                problems. When something is named one has a responsibility to
                put in place policies and to ensure that they are enforced. We
                have named our new problems. Let us build a new Government which
                will take them on board.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The current departmental structures are
                problematic. The Department of Agriculture, for instance, has a
                problem when it is dealing only with the producer and not with
                the consumers. Is it right, for instance, that the producers of
                food and those responsible for food safety should sit within the
                same Department? That is one example. Where do we integrate and
                where do we separate?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One thing that we felt very strongly about
                when we were negotiating the agreement and which, as Mr&nbsp;Mallon
                said, will be an integral part of the new decision-making
                process was the Civic Forum. There are many voices which were
                never traditionally heard in Northern Ireland. Perhaps
                Dr&nbsp;Paisley was right when he said that they were
                politically homeless and that they are represented by the
                elected Members of this House.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would argue that it is going to take many,
                many years for people to join the political parties as they are
                now constituted. Some people cannot, because of their jobs or
                occupations, be seen to be associated with political parties.
                That does not mean that they are not playing a huge role in
                society. I believe that we could have had an enormous crisis of
                Bosnia-type proportions if we had not had such a buoyant civic
                society to turn to at the height of sectarian divisions over the
                past 30 years. Let us build on it; let us not knock it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are many walls coming down. Let us
                build using the same bricks, the bricks of civic society, to put
                in place a different kind of forum. People outside are ready and
                we must show that we will soon be ready to put the structure in
                place.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My final question could perhaps be answered
                in the summing up. What is meant by paragraph 4.12 of the
                Interim Report? It says</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;It is anticipated that the inaugural
                meeting of the North/South Ministerial Council will take place
                in the near future.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Who will be at that inaugural meeting? What
                is meant by the near future? We need answers. We have moved at
                enormous speed since Good&nbsp;Friday, and some of us might have
                said that it was so fast that we could not keep up with it. We
                went from the agreement to the referendum, out of the referendum
                into the elections, out of the elections and into the first
                meeting of the Assembly in Castle Buildings, and now into our
                new building. We were right to move at that momentum — when
                there are vacuums, there is tension, and we must not create more
                vacuums because tension will increase. The Executive should be
                set up as soon as possible. We have meetings in place to help us
                do that, and thereafter we will establish the North/South
                Council and the British/Irish Council.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, I would like to thank all those in
                the Secretariat who were responsible for this report. They have
                had an enormous job during the summer, but it is good that we
                have the report in front of us now, tiny, and interim as it is.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The people of Northern Ireland did not send
                us here, as Mr Hume said, to sit around and talk or to sit
                around and shout at each other, but to start building. We went
                out in June to fight and win elections. Now we have been tasked
                to govern and lead.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Taylor:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This has been a very reasoned and
                level-headed debate. Indeed, this is a very good initial formal
                meeting of our new Assembly for Northern Ireland here in our
                Parliament Buildings at Stormont. I, of course, have served in
                many devolved institutions in this building, in the old
                Parliament, in the two subsequent Assemblies and in the
                Constitutional Convention. Each of them failed in its own way,
                and that is history now. We now have a chance to move forward in
                Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unfortunately, we meet against the background
                of what has been a tragic summer, and I join those Members who
                expressed sympathy to all who suffered from the terrible
                terrorist incidents, to the families who were bereaved, and to
                those who have suffered grievously, an experience of which I
                have personal knowledge.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Adams mentioned this Building. In
                time it will be a great asset for all the people of
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland. Decisions have been taken to spend
                £60&nbsp;million or £80 million on buildings for the
                Parliament in Edinburgh, the Assembly in Cardiff and the City
                Council in London. Not only have we saved money, but we will
                have the best building of any devolved institution in this
                nation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Devolution is not just limited to the United
                Kingdom. The Republic of Ireland also will have to proceed
                towards devolution soon if it is to benefit from Objective 1
                allocations by the European Union.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This debate is about the report from the
                First Minister (Designate) and his deputy, and we all owe them a
                vote of thanks for the way in which they have given leadership
                to the people of Northern Ireland during the last, most
                difficult, two months. I express my personal appreciation of
                David&nbsp;Trimble and Seamus&nbsp;Mallon for the way in which
                they worked together at a time when they could have been so
                easily divided by the tragedies, and that would have had a
                divisive effect on the community in Northern&nbsp;Ireland.</p>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I witnessed their working together while I
                was abroad on other business for the Council of Europe. I have
                seen it in the European media, and I have listened to foreign
                politicians. They are all impressed with the kind of new
                leadership that is emerging in Northern&nbsp;Ireland. In this
                report the First Minister (Designate) and the Deputy First
                Minister (Designate) have managed to make progress on all the
                fronts that we would expect them to, and they have done it
                quickly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has been much to do. There has been
                criticism that there is no real meat in this report but in the
                short time over the summer — a holiday period — they have
                managed to bring forward this report which covers all aspects of
                the Northern&nbsp;Ireland Assembly’s work. They deserve our
                appreciation. I know it has been a demanding time for them and
                their families, friends and colleagues. I thank them very much
                for this report which has been well received by Members.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms&nbsp;McWilliams asked about paragraph 4.12
                and wanted to know the meaning of the phrase that the
                North/South Council would meet &quot;in the near future&quot;.
                The First Minister (Designate) made it clear in his opening
                speech that the timetable for the North/South Council was quite
                inflexible. It is laid down in the Belfast Agreement and
                progress has to be made. He mentioned likely dates for the
                Assembly to meet to approve proposals for the first North/South
                Council meeting.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has been much debate about the numbers
                of Departments, the number of Ministers, whether there should be
                a Minister for each Department and whether there should be
                shared responsibilities. That has all to be studied in detail,
                and that must be done on a consultative basis by the First
                Minister (Designate) and Deputy First Minister (Designate) along
                with all the parties. I hope that when they do come to it —
                and I am glad to see there is to be some reference to European
                Union matters which are much more relevant now than they were in
                the previous Assemblies and the previous Parliament in this
                building — that they will cover subjects such as sport.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sport should be given greater priority in
                Northern Ireland’s political life. We have had a great success
                today at the Commonwealth Games where we won one of the shooting
                competitions.<i> [Laughter].</i> I am glad to see Mr&nbsp;Adams
                laughing. It was with legal firearms, but it was a great
                achievement for Northern&nbsp;Ireland to win its first gold
                medal. Let us hope that it will win more. The
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland cricket team did well last week in
                Kuala&nbsp;Lumpur, and we are doing well in Gaelic — oh yes,
                Gaelic exists in Northern&nbsp;Ireland, and I recognise that.
                Unfortunately we are not doing so well in soccer, but
                Eddie&nbsp;Irvine, whose home town is near my constituency, did
                well yesterday. We have a good record in sport, and we should
                give it greater support and emphasis.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The number of Ministers will, of course,
                relate to various subjects such as sport, the European Union,
                and all the various departments which presently exist in the
                Northern Ireland administration, but it will also depend on
                whether we are able to form an Executive. That, of course,
                raises the question of the decommissioning of illegal firearms
                and armaments, and those who have an influence on that matter
                will be required to address that before real progress can be
                made.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the problems in Northern Ireland life
                under direct rule — and we all know this, no matter what party
                we belong to — has been the rapid growth of quangos, of
                unelected people dictating what should happen in our communities
                throughout Northern Ireland. Of course, one of the reasons for
                that was that we did not have an elected forum representative of
                all the people of Northern Ireland. We have that now, and that
                means that we in this Assembly must begin to address the issue
                of removing many of these quangos and reducing public
                expenditure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will give Members one example. Road schemes
                are important, and the most important road scheme in Northern
                Ireland is the Comber bypass. The cost of building it is
                estimated to be £3&nbsp;million. Some years ago, the Northern
                Ireland Office created health and social services councils in
                Northern Ireland — quangos — in order to represent public
                opinion to the health boards. It costs £750,000 per year to run
                these quangos, the members of which are not known to the public
                and probably not even to the politicians. Abolish these councils
                and in four years we will have the £3&nbsp;million needed to
                build the Comber bypass. There is one example of how to run this
                country.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are other important issues too, of
                course. For instance, we have far more levels of government in
                this country than any other region in Western Europe. That is
                the kind of issue that Members must address.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of course, there is a role for the Civic
                Forum. It is recommended in the Belfast Agreement — I wonder
                how this term &quot;Good Friday&quot; came in. We should keep
                away from religious terms and stick to the proper name, which is
                the Belfast Agreement. The Civic Forum was one of the issues in
                that agreement, and we will make every effort to implement it.
                It must be considered in greater detail after more consultation.
                Numerous organisations are already taking an interest in it,
                which is encouraging. We must make sure that it is
                representative.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am thinking purely of the business
                community, because although we do have organisations — and
                some of them now have Members elected to this body —
                nonetheless, some of those organisations are not totally
                representative of the business community in Northern Ireland.
                Ninety per cent of the firms in Northern Ireland that employ 10
                or more people are not in the Confederation of British Industry,
                so how can the CBI claim to speak for business
                in&nbsp;Northern&nbsp;Ireland? The Institute of Directors
                is&nbsp;an&nbsp;excellent organisation. However, there are
                27,000&nbsp;directors in Northern Ireland and only 500 of them
                are in the institute. Let us get the Chambers of Commerce and
                the Chambers of Trade involved — they represent businessmen in
                this community as well</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have an opportunity to look not to the
                past — much of which I take a pride in, incidentally, but
                there were mistakes as well — but to look forward and
                together, representing Nationalists and Unionists and those who
                do not know what they are. Let us try to work together to build
                a better Northern Ireland which will be peaceful and bring
                greater prosperity. Between us we can make Northern&nbsp;Ireland
                one of the stars of Western Europe.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGrady:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It will not surprise the Assembly to hear
                that I wholeheartedly welcome this interim report. I endorse
                what Mr&nbsp;Taylor said regarding the leadership and the
                example which was given to this community by the First Minister
                (Designate) and the Deputy First Minister (Designate) by their
                manner in the midst of the very trying circumstances of what has
                been called &quot;our wicked summer&quot;. They showed this
                community how we can overcome those who try to destroy us and
                those who try to divide us, and their very appearance together
                was a healing force at a time when that was most needed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The agreement is similar to the iceberg: we
                just see the tip of it. All of us who have participated in the
                various Committees of this Assembly know well the quantitative
                work carried out by all the parties and the co-operation and the
                good will which existed in those Committees. Sometimes that
                imagery of hard work and co-operation has not always filtered
                out to the general public. Indeed, if they will forgive me for
                saying so, some parties would not like word to filter out that
                we have executive decisions to make, execute and act upon,
                following agreement among all the parties in respect of many
                matters affecting the administration of this House.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We accept the entitlement of Members to
                oppose the agreement and to uphold certain policies. However, I
                question whether it is right for parties to thwart the will of
                the people who have said in a referendum that they want the
                structures outlined in the agreement to be put in place for the
                governance of the Six Counties. Parties who are tempted to
                frustrate the will of the people must ask themselves that
                question.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some Members have already indicated the
                enormity of the challenge before us. We have all been presented
                with a clean sheet — a square pad — in which we have to fill
                in all the details of the new Government from start to
                conclusion. That is an awesome task and it is allied to the
                urgency which is dictated to us not just by the agreement or by
                the legislation, but by very practical circumstances. I refer to
                the consequence of undue delays in the governance of
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland at the moment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some Departments are not acting because they
                are waiting for the outcome of our deliberations. Others are
                acting precipitously, introducing new policies and new ideas,
                knowing full well that we are opposed to some of those
                decisions. As we sit here, Ministers and civil servants are
                imposing policies and executing policy which is contrary to the
                cross-Floor support of this Assembly. This is a matter of great
                urgency that must drive us above anything else of a practical or
                political nature.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The structures that we are trying to put in
                place must be looked at from a radical point of view. A Member
                said earlier that there were many building blocks within each
                Department. But those building blocks do not have to stay within
                those Departments and they should be, and must be, moved around
                to give the improved delivery of service that we have promised
                to deliver to the people over many years of electoral campaigns.
                It is important that we address this issue quickly and urgently.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The agenda for equality of esteem and for
                equality of participation is cross-departmental and the
                necessity to have community relations enhanced and advanced is
                trans-departmental. But there are many other aspects, economic
                and policy-wise, of Departments that must be looked at in a very
                fundamental way to bring about the structures which will deliver
                the best possible service to the people we represent.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.00 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are two constraints on that. There is
                the need to agree policy between ourselves for the
                administration of all those economic and social matters for
                which we will be responsible. That in itself is a very daunting
                task. Added to that, of course are the consequential financial
                burdens that we must carry. This Assembly must be frugal, as
                Mr&nbsp;Empey has said, and ensure that decisions do not waste
                money on administration which, the Social Democratic and Labour
                Party has always preached, should be put into services and their
                delivery.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This should be the urgency with which we must
                address these things. We must shorten the period of the vacuum
                which has been created and address these executive decisions
                which have been taken against our will. That is why the process
                must trundle on much more rapidly than any of us might wish.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a comment in paragraph 4.12 about
                the inaugural meeting of the North/South body. There is nothing
                hidden in that agenda that I can see. There is nothing that
                cannot and will not be addressed on the Floor of this House. We
                must have an inaugural meeting to discuss the broad parameters
                that will facilitate the process. That applies also to the
                British/Irish Council and to the Civic Forum — it applies to
                all.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What we really need is more trust between one
                another. Let us give one another that trust for the next couple
                of months and see where that gets us. All being well, we will
                have an effective and servicing administration that is endorsed
                by everyone in this Chamber.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is regrettable that the First Minister
                (Designate) and the Deputy First Minister (Designate) have
                failed to carry out the first task with which the Assembly
                charged them. They were charged, at our meeting in July, to
                bring forward proposals on all of these matters. They have not
                done so.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As far as the Democratic Unionist Party is
                concerned let me make it very clear that we intend to implement
                our manifesto commitment. That commitment is to hold the First
                Minister (Designate) and the Prime Minister of the United
                Kingdom to the pledges that they made during the referendum
                campaign, and when Members of the Assembly start talking about
                the great support that this agreement had from the people, they
                had better remember the basis upon which that agreement was
                reached.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was reached because very clear commitments
                were given, in one case in Parliament by the Prime Minister,
                that substantial decommissioning had to take place before Sinn
                Fein would be allowed in Government, that they had to give up
                violence for good and they had to be committed exclusively to
                peaceful and democratic means. On that basis the Democratic
                Unionist Party believes that it is proper that it uses its
                energy and its talents in the best interests of the people of
                Northern Ireland — and we will do that in or out of office.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As far as the Departments are concerned it is
                slightly nauseating to look at the attempt by some to carve up
                the Government of Northern Ireland on the basis of jobs for the
                boys. The only issue that the Assembly should be considering is
                how Northern Ireland can best be governed — how many
                Departments would allow for the best form of government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hutchinson indicated that he believes that
                to be 10. He could be right. Few of us, if any, have sufficient
                experience of the workings of government to be able to make that
                judgement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a case for looking at the status quo
                more closely in the initial period. I agree with the Alliance
                Party who drew attention to the Department of the Environment,
                being regarded sometimes as the &quot;Department of
                Everything&quot;. It is far too large and should be split. There
                is a clear case for keeping the existing Departments, dividing
                the Department of the Environment into two and getting ourselves
                off the ground on that basis. Six months or a year down the
                line, with the experience that we have gained, we may decide
                whether there should be eight or more. Indeed, if we do not do
                that, the review will be Civil&nbsp;Service-led. Civil servants
                will walk over Members in terms of their experience of what
                happens in each of the Departments.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Empey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the number of Departments is entirely
                politically driven at the outset and we subsequently review that
                number in the light of experience, does the Member agree that it
                would be easy to go up to the top limit of 10 but virtually
                impossible to come down?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;P&nbsp;Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree entirely. There are political
                difficulties in reducing rather than increasing in the future.
                One clear division that my colleague and I had with the First
                Minister (Designate) and the Deputy First&nbsp;Minister
                (Designate) during our meeting was when reference was made to
                the issue of junior&nbsp;Ministers. An attempt was clearly being
                made, on foot of an amendment by the Social Democratic and
                Labour Party at Westminster, to put that into the hands of the
                First&nbsp;Minister (Designate) and the Deputy
                First&nbsp;Minister (Designate). That would be contrary both to
                the agreement and to the Bill which is presently before the
                House.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The d’Hondt principle guides not only
                ministerial positions but also the positions of Chairman and
                Deputy Chairman. Without distinction, the section that deals
                with Executive authority in the Belfast&nbsp;Agreement states</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Following the election of the
                First&nbsp;Minister and Deputy First&nbsp;Minister the posts of
                Ministers&quot; —</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">it does not reflect whether those are senior
                ministerial or junior ministerial posts —</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;will be allocated to parties on the
                basis of the d’Hondt system.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Therefore it is clear that if the
                First&nbsp;Minister (Designate) and his Deputy were to step
                outside the terms of the agreement and the Bill, they would face
                serious legal difficulties and there would be serious
                implications for the workings of this Assembly. I urge caution
                upon them in case they determine to select their friends for
                junior ministerial posts and impose them on us.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Under the d’Hondt system, the task of
                making those nominations is given to the Leaders of the
                political parties or their nominees. As a party, we would not
                want the First Minister (Designate) and the Deputy First
                Minister (Designate) to choose anyone for a junior ministerial
                post from among our ranks — not that they are likely to do so.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As far as the North/South structures are
                concerned, I was alarmed to read in the note that was presented
                to us from Paul&nbsp;Murphy that he saw the issues listed in the
                Belfast Agreement as a &quot;baseline position&quot;.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Democratic Unionist Party considers it to
                be beyond the limit — not as a baseline from which the
                Government or this Assembly may move. It goes far beyond what is
                acceptable to the Unionist community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The other issue is in relation to the
                Civic&nbsp;Forum. I do not believe that the Civic&nbsp;Forum
                should meet in this Building. If it does, it will be considered
                as something of a Second Chamber. It is a consultative body. We
                have all had opinions given to us by people in the various
                sectors that are listed in the agreement, and I do not see a
                difficulty in their having expressed these views, but it is
                quite another issue as to how structured the presentation of
                those views should be.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those are not the only sectors that should be
                considered. For example, Mr&nbsp;Taylor referred to sport, an
                area of significant interest in Northern&nbsp;Ireland and one
                that should be considered by the Civic&nbsp;Forum. Local
                government is clearly another important area that should be
                considered. The Civic Forum should not meet in Stormont and
                become a poor man’s House of Lords for the
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am also somewhat concerned at references in
                this document that was presented to the First&nbsp;Minister
                (Designate), the Deputy First&nbsp;Minister (Designate) and to
                the various political parties as part of the consultation. There
                is a clear indication that some civil servants view the new
                Assembly as an opportunity to change the way
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland is governed for their benefit.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To say the least, there is an implication in
                the agreement that the plan is not to make Northern&nbsp;Ireland
                more democratic, but to encourage something similar to the peace
                and reconciliation partnerships where various non-elected bodies
                are involved in government. The Democratic Unionist Party has
                common cause with the Ulster Unionist Party on quangos. We want
                to remove as many of those quangos as possible, as quickly as
                possible and make public life in Northern Ireland more
                democratic. However, to replace them and, indeed, replace local
                government with some form of even greater quango would be a
                retrograde step and one that I would not want the Assembly to
                support.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister (Designate) and the Deputy
                First Minister (Designate) have failed to grasp the key issue,
                which is that their report should have contained recommendations
                on the number of Departments and other issues. There is only one
                factor stopping them from doing that, and that is the reluctance
                of the First Minister (Designate) to grasp the nettle of Sinn
                Fein’s participation in government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with Mr&nbsp;McCartney: the Belfast
                Agreement makes it very clear that Sinn Fein is entitled to
                places on the Executive on the sole basis that the party uses
                its influence in respect of decommissioning. The First Minister
                (Designate) does not want to show the people of
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland that he misled them during the referendum
                campaign when he said that he could prevent Sinn Fein
                representation on the Executive. He must face up to that issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As soon as the Additional Standing Orders are
                agreed we will have a mechanism whereby Members other than the
                First Minister and Deputy First Minister can bring the issue of
                exclusion to the Assembly. If the Assembly judges that there is
                a party that is not committed exclusively to peaceful and
                democratic means, it has the power to exclude its Members from
                ministerial posts in the Executive. Certainly the Democratic
                Unionist Party will be willing to raise that issue in the
                Assembly and give the First Minister the opportunity, rather
                than sticking his chest out, to do something tangible.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The minutes of the meetings of the Ulster
                Unionist Party’s Assembly Members make it abundantly clear
                that many of them are not prepared to accept Sinn Fein in
                government. On the radio this morning Mr&nbsp;Taylor berated the
                Democratic Unionist Party and said that since they sit down in
                councils with Sinn Fein they should be prepared to sit with them
                in government. If that is the position of the Ulster Unionist
                Party, then there is no bar to Sinn Fein being in government, as
                far as they are concerned. I would like to hear some of the
                Ulster Unionist Party’s Members saying whether they agree with
                Mr&nbsp;Taylor on that matter.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Paragraph 4.12 of the interim report from the
                First Minister (Designate) and the Deputy First Minister
                (Designate) states that the inaugural meeting of the North/South
                Ministerial Council will take place in the near future, when</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;we hope there will be a substantive
                exchange across a range of matters with Irish Ministers.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with the First Minister (Designate)
                when he says that, given the approaching deadline, Members
                should approach this work programme with a sense of urgency.
                Therefore we need a meeting. The agreement makes it very clear
                that the North/South Ministerial Council should meet regularly
                in the time between the election of the Assembly and the
                transfer of power to the Assembly. Ten weeks have passed since
                the election to the Assembly and there has yet to be a meeting.
                I, therefore, agree that we need a meeting very soon.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The agreement also makes it clear that the
                representation from the Assembly to the North/South Ministerial
                Council consists of the First Minister (Designate), the Deputy
                First Minister (Designate) and any relevant Ministers. It is
                therefore clear that the North/South Ministerial Council cannot
                have the type of substantive exchange across the range of
                matters that is envisaged and we cannot put together a work
                programme which will bring into being the implementation bodies
                and complete that programme by 31&nbsp;October without the
                appointment of the relevant Ministers for those areas covered by
                the implementation bodies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I therefore concur with Members from the
                other parties who have expressed concern about or questioned how
                that meeting should proceed. In particular, I agree with Ms
                McWilliams that we need to get clarification very soon on how
                the First Minister (Designate) and the Deputy First Minister
                (Designate) see that meeting. I acknowledge that Mr&nbsp;Taylor
                said that we have had such an answer, but I do not believe that
                we had such an answer today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the number of Departments or
                Ministers we need, I totally agree with Mr&nbsp;Neeson that that
                proposal should not and cannot be put forward on the basis of
                scoring points against other parties. That is not the way in
                which we should proceed or the kind of example that we wish to
                set to others at this time. On the contrary, Members should
                consider the work of a Department and whether it best meets the
                needs of the people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Paisley said that Members should now be
                seeing detailed proposals rather than the vague information
                contained in the interim report from the First Minister
                (Designate) and the Deputy Minister (Designate). Like
                Dr&nbsp;Paisley, I too hope to see such detailed proposals very
                soon.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Close:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Taylor expressed his thanks and those of
                his party to the First Minister (Designate) and the Deputy First
                Minister (Designate) for the wonderful way in which they
                represented the community over the traumatic month following the
                happenings in Omagh. I agree. The vast majority of people in the
                area which I represent were struck by the manner in which their
                togetherness represented the new beginning for Northern Ireland,
                the coming together of its people, and it gave hope for the
                future. The way in which they performed their duties on our
                behalf must be commended by all Members.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Northern Ireland is entering a very exciting
                time. We are setting out on a path to provide a new form of
                government. In many respects its skeleton is represented by the
                Good Friday Agreement, a term which means a lot to me, for like
                Good Friday, this agreement offers hope to the people of
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland. The important thing about the agreement
                is that it has been accepted and democratically endorsed by the
                overwhelming majority of the people. The task that now confronts
                every Member is to set about putting some flesh on the skeleton
                of the Good Friday Agreement. It is a task which we should set
                about together. The importance of us striving together cannot be
                over-estimated because it is vital for the agreement’s
                success.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many issues divide us, but the one thing we
                have in common is our democratic mandate. That mandate is
                equally important to each of us, and we operate from that basis.
                The people of Northern Ireland are demanding a new start. They
                have made their voices absolutely clear. Our responsibility is
                to translate that demand into action.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is essential that we take the opportunity
                provided by the agreement to have 10 Departments. I do not see
                that as a way of providing ‘jobs for the boys’ because no
                one from the Alliance party will have any of those potential
                jobs. The Alliance Party believes in equality, not quantity, of
                representation. Although we will not qualify under the d’Hondt
                procedure for these jobs for the boys, it will not prevent me
                from arguing the case as to why there should be the maximum of
                10 Departments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Anyone who has dealt with Government
                institutions in Northern Ireland over the years will recognise
                that the existing Departments are cumbersome, in many respects
                meaningless, and in all respects unaccountable to the people of
                Northern Ireland. We must make accountability our key priority,
                and this can be best achieved by removing the weighty
                bureaucracy that has held down the potential dynamism in
                Northern Ireland. Free the people from bureaucracy. Hand control
                back to democratically elected representatives, and let them get
                on with running up to 10 Departments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I could give a few examples. I once heard the
                Department of the Environment referred to as the Department of
                eejits, but I will not comment on that. It is a Department which
                is bureaucratic in the extreme. A massive job needs to be done
                to break it down and bring it closer to the people. Let us start
                peeling away the layers of the onion and get to the core of
                Government, represented through meaningful Departments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have spent the last quarter of a century of
                my life in local government in Northern Ireland. Our hands are
                tied at every turn. We cannot even change a light bulb without
                the say-so of a bureaucrat. Is that democracy? Do we not all
                want to join together in changing that? I believe the answer is
                yes. Is there not a strong case for allowing the dynamic that
                exists in local government to act on behalf of the people? Is
                there not the necessary dynamism there to create and operate a
                Department of local government, planning and housing?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the greatest potential growth areas in
                Northern Ireland is tourism. The way that tourism has been
                operated in Northern Ireland leaves a lot to be desired. Is this
                not another opportunity to develop that potential, to give that
                potential to the people and to make it a meaningful potential
                Department.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sport has been referred to. There are
                numerous areas where we can have more effective and efficient
                Government. I take Mr&nbsp;Empey’s point about cost. The
                answer is to remove the unnecessary burden of costs that are
                currently imposed through quangos, unnecessary boards and trusts
                and the layer upon layer of administration all of which are
                costing money. We have the opportunity to strip those away and
                to get back to meaningful democratic and accountable Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As stated in the report, there are complex
                and challenging issues confronting us in shaping the future. A
                small step has been taken in this interim report. Let us build
                on it. My plea is that we build on it together. It is only by
                working together through this House that we will bring about the
                necessary improvements to the lives of all the people.</p>

                that they got off to less than an impressive start. We were
                given this report, on which we were to give our views about five
                minutes before we came into this debate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The reason for that delay is not suggested in
                the report but it is quite evident to the Members of my party.
                Last week we met the First Minister (Designate) and the Deputy
                First Minister (Designate), and they told us that there were two
                fundamental areas on which they could not agree. They could not
                agree on the substance of the remit that was given to them to
                determine the number of Ministries and the portfolio of each of
                the Ministries.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.30 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, they could not agree on a matter
                that is even more fundamental than the core administrative
                structures for Northern Ireland. That is, they could not agree
                on how to establish the democratic credentials of whatever form
                of government was to suit Northern Ireland within the Union. In
                other words, they could not agree on the issue of the
                decommissioning of paramilitary weapons. It is absolutely
                crucial to be clear about this issue and to keep the focus on
                it, yet many speeches today have tried to shift our focus away
                from what is absolutely crucial to establishing the structures
                of proper government in Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The reason the First Minister (Designate) and
                the Deputy First Minister (Designate) could not agree on what
                would establish the democratic credibility of the structures of
                Government in Northern Ireland is that the Deputy First Minister
                (Designate) has an absolutely correct interpretation of the
                Belfast Agreement: it does not require anyone to decommission
                anything at any time. But the problem with the First Minister
                (Designate) is that he sold the agreement to the Unionist
                electorate on the basis of pledges given by the Prime Minister
                which are entirely outside its remit.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have now reached the position where, in
                order to set up an Executive, a decision has to be made on the
                requirements that are to be made on the issue of the surrender
                of terrorist arsenals to a lawful authority. That is the
                fundamental divide between the First Minister (Designate) and
                the Deputy First Minister (Designate). Having got caught in that
                position, Mr&nbsp;Trimble has, in effect, agreed to a
                substantive thrust in this document.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are no substantive proposals in the
                document, but there is a substantive thrust, which is, of
                concern to parties on both sides of the House. It is that before
                there is an agreed Executive and, therefore, before there are
                any coherent policy proposals or any programmes of government
                for Northern Ireland, because of the requirement in the Belfast
                Agreement to meet the deadline of 31&nbsp;October 1998, they are
                proposing to proceed to meet those requirements, not with a
                fully-formed Executive but simply by way of representation by
                the First Minister (Designate) and his deputy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is both contrary to the letter and to
                the spirit of the agreement and I find myself agreeing entirely,
                if I understood his position correctly, with the Sinn Fein
                Member’s interpretation of the agreement. I hasten to say that
                I find myself in agreement only with Sinn Fein’s perfectly
                correct interpretation of the agreement and not with its
                content, which was precisely the reason that our party rejected
                it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Trimble now finds himself in a
                position of deadlock on the formation of the Executive and the
                core structures of government for Northern Ireland, and he is
                trying to obscure that deadlock by moving to put into effect the
                all-Ireland dimension of the agreement. Therefore, he is acting
                contrary to the interest of his own constituency, both in terms
                of establishing the democratic credentials of the agreement and
                also in terms of securing the position of Northern Ireland
                within the Union. He is doing&nbsp;that because of the position
                that he adopted in relation to what was a primary matter in
                the&nbsp;referendum: whether the agreement actually required
                decommissioning.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The problem is how to move away from the
                thrust of these proposals, and we must do so by insisting that
                there can be no development of any all-Ireland dimension prior
                to establishing the proper basis of democratic and accountable
                Government in Northern Ireland.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I reiterate what Mr&nbsp;Taylor said in his
                opening remarks by commending both the First Minister
                (Designate) and Deputy First Minister (Designate) on how they
                spoke and acted over the summer. Their conduct was a beacon to
                those in Northern Ireland who wished to see a positive way
                forward being shown by the elected politicians working for their
                good.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We meet today with an almost
                once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to get the right Government for
                Northern Ireland. A once-only opportunity is certainly not to be
                rushed. One must not take an inordinate length of time, but we
                must take some time. I have not seen anyone in business or in
                any organisation determining structure before policy. To simply
                say we must have a particular number of Departments from which
                we determine policy is to approach the matter the wrong way. We
                need to consider the policy we wish to implement; after that
                will come the Departments. That is why the Ulster Unionist Party
                during the first stage, wants to keep to six or seven
                Departments. We are working through paragraph 35 of the
                agreement, which covers transitional arrangements.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many Members have spoken about a lack of
                speed and about what we could be doing more quickly. Devolution
                is coming to all regions of the United Kingdom. The previous
                Conservative Government wanted devolution in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland but not for Scotland or Wales. At least
                this Labour Government seems to be more principled in their
                application of policy throughout the United Kingdom. But compare
                Northern Ireland with Scotland; whose referendum was last
                September. There was a constitutional convention comprising all
                opinion in Scotland as to how devolution should take place.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We had our referendum in May. Already we have
                had our election to the Assembly; we have our First Minister and
                Deputy First Minister in place, and we are beginning the process
                of formulating how this part of the United Kingdom is to be
                governed. All that was done against a backcloth of 30&nbsp;years
                of violence, which makes it difficult to progress quickly on
                certain matters. The speed with which we have been acting,
                through the First Minister (Designate) and the Deputy First
                Minister (Designate) is to be commended.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mention has been made of an island economy
                and the need, when working through all these arrangements, to
                work within one island. It is devoid of logic to say that one
                island must be one unit and one economy. Borders transcend land
                and water. The island of Borneo comprises three states; the
                island of Hawaii is part of the United States of America even
                though it is in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. This agreement
                builds upon reality, the reality of the British/Irish isles and
                North/South and East/West working in co-operation to the mutual
                benefit of all.</p>

                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree that it is crucial to focus on this
                point. I have said this before, and I will say it again. We have
                been quite explicit about decommissioning. But the Leader of the
                United Kingdom Unionist Party, writing in the ‘Belfast
                Telegraph’ on 1&nbsp;May&nbsp;1998 stated at point five of his
                eight-point plan, which he had announced the previous night on a
                television programme, that there were two criteria for political
                parties to be treated as equals — especially those parties
                linked to paramilitary organisations. We know what
                &quot;equal&quot; means. One was a permanent renunciation of
                violence and the other was a public dissociation from all forms
                of violence. Neither of those criteria mentions decommissioning
                as a prerequisite for being treated equally.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I stand by my interpretation of what he said.
                Before the United Kingdom Unionist Party questions the
                credentials of the Ulster Unionist Party on decommissioning, it
                should put its own house in order.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Money will be an important element in the
                workings of this Government. Until now money has been allocated
                to the rest of the United Kingdom as a transfer within
                Government, within the block grant. We will now have what is
                known as a territorial transfer.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Money will be allocated to Scotland and
                Wales, and it will now be seen how good, whether we like it or
                not, per capita, funding has been for Northern&nbsp;Ireland.
                Some will question why we receive so much and why we have
                facilities that they do not possess.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Lord&nbsp;Mayor of London, speaking on
                behalf of the people of London, will be quick to point out that
                they are net contributors — they give more in revenue than
                they gain in spending. These questions will be asked, and
                therefore it is all the more incumbent on us to be prudent in
                our spending and not to rush a decision on structures. We must
                get our policy right and be sure where the money will be spent.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I conclude on a point of optimism. A young
                man who lives near me never spoke to me about politics until

                the First&nbsp;Minister (Designate) and the Deputy
                First&nbsp;Minister (Designate) have initiated through this
                document.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important in dealing with the issues in
                the report and the various suggestions that have been made
                during the debate, to bear in mind some realities. There are the
                realities of the agreement as well as financial realities and
                the structural requirements that we will need as an Assembly
                and, more broadly, as a community for the new dispensation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Nesbitt referred to paragraph&nbsp;35
                of the agreement. As he said, it refers to the transitional
                arrangements. It was envisaged that in the transitional period
                Members serving as shadow Ministers would affirm a
                &quot;shadow&quot; pledge of office. The whole concept of the
                &quot;shadow&quot; pledge emerged in the negotiations because
                there was a requirement for people, on taking office, to make
                some pledge to the Assembly about the sort of commitments that
                they were prepared to undertake.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Various parties had suspicions about how
                shadow office might be exploited in the absence of a pledge, and
                that is why it came about. It was envisaged that Departments and
                shadow Ministers in those Departments would be identified during
                the transitional period. It is important that slips of memory
                about this are not allowed to upset the thrust of the agreement
                itself.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A case has been made for delaying the
                submission of proposals on the number and on the specific remits
                of Departments. I accept that there is a need to take care in
                how we constitute particular Departments. My colleague Mr&nbsp;McGrady
                said earlier that we have to be radical and, at the same time,
                practical. We have no wish to be reckless about finance when
                considering the constitution of new Departments. The Assembly
                will operate within fixed limits anyway, notwithstanding the
                Chancellor’s so-called &quot;new money&quot;.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We put forward proposals during our meeting
                with the First Minister (Designate) and the Deputy First
                Minister (Designate) for 10 Departments, which would be assigned
                to 10 Ministers other than the First Minister and his deputy. We
                did so not in terms of &quot;noses in troughs&quot;, or anything
                else that has been suggested, but on the basis of what we saw as
                public-service requirements. We believe that a strong case can
                be made for these 10 Departments, and that is why we have
                suggested them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The departmental structure should be looked
                at on its own merits, divorced from the speculation about
                parties and personalities, because in designing departmental
                structures we are asking public servants to work in those
                Departments on the basis of their public-service roles and not
                on the basis of which Minister may or may not be assigned to
                them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In designing departmental structures we are
                designing structures that are meant to serve the community in
                its entirety, to meet its diverse social, economic, cultural and
                environmental needs and therefore, we should take care not to
                allow the difficulties and differences that exist about the
                precise formation of an Executive to get in the way.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should get on with the task of looking at
                those Departments now. This is our chance to offer people the
                first democratic dividend from the agreement. Let us do that.
                Let us not reduce it to a bunfight or trivialise it as some sort
                of party political cargo. In that context our plan for 10
                Departments would stand scrutiny. These Departments would be
                worthwhile for any Minister and worthwhile for Members in terms
                of our opportunity to serve on departmental Committees.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the points that came up again and
                again in the talks about how the Assembly might conduct its
                business was whether we needed Ministers as such, or whether
                things might be done more generally by Committees. Those who
                favoured the Committee model wanted to make sure that Members of
                the Assembly other than Ministers would have a real and
                meaningful role. That means real and meaningful Departments. If
                some Ministers were in charge of Departments and some were not,
                that would create a premier league of Ministers, which would
                cause difficulties for the Civil Service at administrative
                level. It would also lead to problems in the Assembly in terms
                of opportunities for Committee participation by Members.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Obviously we will still need a Department of
                Finance, but our proposals envisage the personnel side of the
                current Department of Finance and Personnel being hived off into
                an office of public service, or office of public administration,
                resting with the First and Deputy First Ministers. The
                Department of Agriculture, as it stands, obviously covers
                important areas which can hardly be broken up. Our proposal is
                for a Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources taking in
                fisheries and forestry as before, and probably also minerals
                from the Department of the Environment as well.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We suggest a Department for Infrastructure,
                taking the Roads and Water Services from the Department of the
                Environment; ports and airports would go into the Department for
                Infrastructure as well. The energy grid would come from the
                Department of Economic Development into the Department for
                Infrastructure along with public transport and communications.
                That Department would be coherent in terms of the
                infrastructural demands that we face, and in terms of the
                important, albeit diminishing, role that the European structural
                funds can play. This Department would have strong economic
                significance.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We would then envisage an element of the
                Department of Economic Development as currently constituted
                being a Department covering enterprise, trade and investment,
                industry and commerce, commercial regulation, consumer affairs,
                et cetera.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We also suggest a Department which would be
                styled something like &quot;Employment and Applied
                Learning&quot; or &quot;Employment and Human Resources
                Development&quot;, and we see that as taking in not just
                employment law, employment practice and labour relations, which
                currently come under the Department of Economic Development, but
                also the Training and Employment Agency and further and higher
                education from the Department of Education.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This Department would be responsible,
                essentially, for everybody over school-leaving age. If anyone
                queried the performance of the Assembly in employment, training,
                or education opportunity terms, we would have one clear
                reference base from which to see how well we are performing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Social, Democratic and Labour Party
                envisaged a Department of Social Support and Development, taking
                housing from the Department of the Environment and the Social
                Security Agency from the Department of Health and Social
                Services and combining them along with those community
                development and regeneration arms that have developed within the
                Department of the Environment. That Department can play not the
                sole role in terms of targeting social need, but an important
                role in helping to achieve that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Over two decades, there has been talk about
                estate-based strategies being the way to deal with areas in
                need. The absence of coherent structures is one of the things
                that has frustrated this actually taking place. We have an
                opportunity to bear these sorts of requirements in mind when
                designing Departments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Department of Health and Community Care
                obviously would remain. We envisage a Department of Education
                which would concentrate essentially on pre-school, primary and
                secondary education as well as on services and broader,
                child-development issues. Perhaps that Department of Education
                could crack some of the outstanding difficult issues that so far
                we have not been able to crack such as our very deficient
                performance in the pre-school area and the question of
                selection, which many people at the negotiations will remember
                was the subject of a very animated discussion one particular
                day.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome what other people have said about
                sport. We would propose to take that out of the Department of
                Education, along with culture, the arts and languages, and we
                put them, as Mr Neeson hinted earlier, with tourism. We think
                those areas complement each other in promotional and performance
                terms and not just in terms of bringing tourists in but also in
                terms of encouraging good services for visitors and interesting
                activities among the local population.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wonder if you could draw your remarks to a
                close.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yes, Mr Initial Presiding Officer.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The final one we envisage — these are not
                absolutes or demands but simply proposals to show that a good
                case can be made for 10 Departments — is in the area of the
                environment, a Department to take in planning, waste management,
                environmental protection and public safety. We see the
                Department of the Environment and Public Safety taking in the
                Fire Service and the other rescue services as well, because
                there is a watch-dog role in both of those areas to see how the
                different Departments are performing in environmental and safety
                terms.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are quite open to different proposals and
                arguments, and have put forward certain proposals for functions
                that do have to rest with the First Minister (Designate) the
                Deputy First Minister (Designate), if they are to perform their
                overall responsibility for co-ordination to ensure good
                Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we can set about creating such Departments
                and have Committees working along these lines, we can streamline
                all the litany of quangos which form the intermediary structures
                and sub-structures. This can best be done when we actually know
                what the Departments and the structures are.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I refute any suggestion that we have to
                create policy first and then structures. We negotiated an
                agreement that said that we were to appoint an Executive
                Committee which would, as its first task, produce a programme
                for government. It is clear from the agreement that the
                structures were to be in place before the policy.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dodds:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Nesbitt has said that the speed at which
                the First Minister (Designate) and the Deputy First Minister
                (Designate) have proceeded was to be commended. Many of us here
                were astounded at that comment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This report is devoid of any real substance.
                It refers to meetings that began only last week — some months
                after the Assembly was elected. How he can make such a statement
                staggers me. But then nothing that Mr Nesbitt says surprises me
                — he manages to make an argument out of virtually no building
                blocks.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.00 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I listened with interest to Mr&nbsp;Durkan
                outlining in some detail the arguments for various Departments
                and what functions they should have — indeed some cases may
                have great merit. Others have said why there should be 10
                Departments. As my colleague Mr&nbsp;P&nbsp;Robinson has said,
                that may well be the correct position in due course. However, at
                this time, none of us can argue definitively on that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was interested to compare the views of the
                Deputy First Minister (Designate) which were published in
                yesterday’s ‘Sunday Tribune’. I presume that he was
                talking about the Social Democratic and Labour Party and not for
                Mr&nbsp;Trimble. He said</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;We argue for the creation of a larger
                rather than a smaller number of departments, because this will
                facilitate the inclusion of parties in government.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is nothing there about what is in the
                best interest of the government of Northern Ireland or about
                having Departments cater to the needs of Northern Ireland in
                delivering services. It is purely designed to ensure that it
                will facilitate the inclusion of parties in Government. He went
                on to deal with what each Department should deal with in terms
                of &quot;real significance and substance&quot;.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When Members of the Social Democratic and
                Labour Party and other parties speak, they should be aware that
                the Deputy First Minister (Designate) is taking a line which is
                based upon ensuring that the number of Departments is decided
                for political reasons and that parties are represented. The
                primary reason is not, it seems, what is in the best interests
                of the people of Northern Ireland. I hope that the Deputy
                First&nbsp;Minister (Designate) will respond to that. I regret
                the fact that both the First Minister (Designate) and his Deputy
                spoke at the start of this debate rather than having one of them
                deliver a winding-up speech to respond to some of these
                comments, as is normal practice in most debating Chambers of
                this nature.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister (Designate) spoke with
                enthusiasm of the real steps that were to be taken to ensure the
                North/South Council of Ministers would be up and running by the
                end of September so that real substantive decisions would be
                taken. There was a degree of urgency, he said, about all of
                this, yet when it comes to setting out the basics for the
                government of Northern Ireland, the report says absolutely
                nothing about Departments or about how we should administer
                Northern Ireland. The priorities are completely wrong.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister (Designate) said that the
                agreement could not work unless all of it is made to work. The
                problem for many Unionists, and for many people in Northern
                Ireland, is that they see certain parts of this agreement
                working overtime and other parts not working at all. People see
                prisoners being released despite the pledges by Mr&nbsp;Blair
                and Mr&nbsp;Trimble that people would not be released from
                prison unless violence was shown to be over permanently and
                forever. That clearly has not been the case. On the celebrated
                day on which the media made much of a statement issued by
                IRA/Sinn Fein, Mr&nbsp;Adams said</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Sinn Fein is committed to exclusively
                peaceful and democratic means to achieve a way forward.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sinn Fein believe the violence we have seen
                must be for all of us now a thing of the past, over, done with
                and gone.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the day that that statement was issued a
                report in the ‘Belfast&nbsp;Telegraph’ in relation to the
                Real IRA and the attitude of the Provisional IRA towards that
                organisation stated</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;In the space of 90 minutes, in an
                operation that hinted at the degree of organisation that the
                Provisional IRA is still capable of, each of the key dissidents
                heard the same rap at the door.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On doorsteps across Ireland they found pairs
                of men they would have once called comrades clutching the same
                piece of paper. They carried the same message: the Provisional
                IRA’s Army Council declared the Real IRA had no right to exist
                and had misappropriated weapons – a hanging offence for
                republicans.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They were told that &quot;action will be
                taken&quot; if they did not make amends. Some of the messengers
                felt the need to spell this out: if they did not do the needful,
                the Real IRA’s leadership would be shot.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The same day these weasel words were being
                issued for the benefit of the world’s press in Belfast for the
                Clinton visit. Of course, it was carefully worded, once again
                expressing an aspiration, a hope — not a commitment — on the
                part of the Sinn Fein that the violence was over, a thing of the
                past. Such a commitment could easily have been given, but
                different words were used to ensure that they did not say that
                the war was over once and for all.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While this agreement is delivering
                concessions to IRA/Sinn Fein in terms of the release of
                prisoners and the increasing demands and pressure for Sinn Fein
                to be admitted into the Government of Northern Ireland, we have
                yet to see any deliverance by them, in real terms, of what is
                expected of them in terms of decommissioning.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of course, as has been pointed out absolutely
                correctly by my Colleague, Mr&nbsp;Robinson (the Member for East
                Belfast), Mr&nbsp;McCartney (the Member for North Down) and
                others, there is no requirement in this agreement for any actual
                handing over of weaponry by the IRA before Sinn Fein can take up
                seats in the Government.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In light of what has been said, why are the
                Democratic Unionist Party and the United Kingdom Unionist Party
                giving incorrect justification for no decommissioning of
                weapons, giving support to the IRA today?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dodds:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Foster should join Mr Nesbitt in the
                realms of fantasy land. The reality is that the DUP has been
                absolutely clear and consistent on decommissioning. Mr Foster’s
                party said that there would have to be decommissioning before
                talks could begin. Then it said that there would have to be
                decommissioning by the IRA in parallel with the talks. Then it
                said it would have to be over by the time the talks finished. We
                were later told that there would be decommissioning before
                IRA/Sinn Fein went into the Government or before they would sit
                down one-to-one with Mr&nbsp;Adams.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All those conditions have disappeared, and
                the preparations have been laid for them to sit in the
                Government with IRA without decommissioning. That is the real
                issue. Many Members have talked around it, talked about other
                issues, all of them important in their own right, but the most
                important issue is that of decommissioning and whether IRA/Sinn
                Fein are to be admitted into the Government of Northern Ireland
                while still armed to the teeth.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Flanagan, the Chief Constable of the
                RUC, has made it very clear that while troop levels have been
                reduced and military patrols have been withdrawn in Belfast,
                such paramilitary organisations are still intact and have access
                to arms and ammunition. They continue to pose a grave threat to
                peace, and they are still capable of carrying out atrocities
                such as the Omagh bombing. Yet we are contemplating allowing
                these people soon to sit in the Government of Northern Ireland
                while we have the sort of activity being carried out by the
                military wing of Sinn Fein, as outlined earlier, on the same day
                as they were issuing their statements about a commitment to
                peace and exclusively democratic means.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are many important issues to do with
                democracy and accountability, and we in this party have always
                been to the forefront in championing all of our people and
                advocating proper democratic and accountable government in
                Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But it is not in the interests of the people
                of Northern Ireland to be faced with the prospect of having
                Ministers in charge of Departments while they are sitting on 100
                tonnes of Semtex, with ammunition and a paramilitary machine
                behind them. That is the sort of issue that we need to face. The
                First Minister (Designate) needs to come clean on that issue and
                not continue to waffle on it and try to play for time. He needs
                to spell out the position very clearly. At least the Deputy
                First Minister had the decency to make it very clear that he
                took a different position from the First Minister.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us have clarity from the First Minister.
                Let him state very clearly that in no circumstances will
                IRA/Sinn Fein get into Government unless substantial and
                meaningful decommissioning has taken place, and their
                paramilitary organisations have been dismantled.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I begin by offering my condolences and those
                of Sinn Fein to the relatives of the five people who were killed
                today in a road accident in the south-east of our country, I
                think it was County Wexford. I am told that a lorry with a
                northern registration was also involved. I am sure everybody
                will share that sentiment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the comments by the First Minister
                (Designate) and the Deputy First Minister (Designate) in
                relation to the events of this summer, and the very great
                tragedies which occurred in Ballymoney and in Omagh. It was a
                very traumatic summer for all of us.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of all the Members of the House, the one
                affected most directly was Mr&nbsp;Gibson. We should show him
                special consideration today. We all have very different
                political views, but everyone in Ireland who has been involved
                in this process of conflict resolution over the last four or
                five years was very struck and very hurt by what happened in
                Omagh, and aware of the implications that that undoubtedly had
                for all of us involved in this process.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Nesbitt’s comments about the young
                person from his area who implored him to press on with the
                implementation of the agreement were similar to the response of
                the people of Omagh. I have been in Omagh on a number of
                occasions, and everyone I met — and they were not all
                Nationalists or Republicans; there were Unionists also —
                implored us to do our level best to ensure that the people who
                were out to destroy the search for peace, justice and equality
                in this country would not succeed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I had my own first-hand experience of how
                hurt people are. Republicans have acknowledged that we have
                inflicted hurt; but hurt has also been inflicted on us. We are
                not just talking about the decommissioning of guns, we are
                talking about the decommissioning of all the injustice,
                inequality, discrimination and domination of the past.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was in a building in Omagh on the day of
                the last funerals. I think it was Mrs&nbsp;Rushe who was being
                buried. As I left the building, a number of people wanted to
                shake hands with me. I offered my hand to one young woman who
                could not bring herself to shake hands with me and turned away.
                I accepted that and left the building. As I walked down the
                street, I heard a voice behind me calling my name. I turned
                round and it was the young woman. I went back to her and she
                said &quot;I am sorry for turning away. I am a Unionist and I am
                hurting.&quot;, and she started to cry. I said that we were all
                hurting but that we were doing our best, and she said &quot;I
                know you are doing your best.&quot;</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Last week the First Minister (Designate) did
                not turn away. Considering his background, it was very
                courageous for him to meet the Leader of Sinn Fein, Mr Adams. In
                that meeting, they held out hope and expectation for all of
                those people who have been watching this process over the last
                four or five years. In fact, in the aftermath of the terrible
                summer, and following the meeting between Mr&nbsp;Trimble and
                Mr&nbsp;Adams, there is more support for the peace process now
                than there has ever been. People are urging us to do the right
                thing, to talk to one another, to engage in dialogue and to
                implement the agreement.</p>
                <i>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The agreement is about much more than this
                Assembly. It is about how we end division on this island; it is
                about the establishment of an Executive Committee; it is about
                the establishment of a North/South Ministerial Council; it is
                about the establishment of the implementation bodies; and it is
                about how we deal with the very important issues of justice and
                equality on this island. Sinn Fein represents a community which
                believes — and I know many people here within the most extreme
                elements of Unionism find this hard to accept — that since
                Ireland was partitioned they have been persecuted, dominated and
                treated unfairly in this state. That is the reality that Members
                have to deal with and that has given rise to conflict on this
                island over the past 70 years or so.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members must work to bring about the
                implementation of the agreement and show, as we build that
                agreement in all its different stages, that we can get to grips
                with all that has been wrong in this state since Ireland was
                partitioned. I accept absolutely what Mr&nbsp;Hutchinson has
                said, that a great wrong was also inflicted on the Protestant
                working class, many of whom were also treated as second-class
                citizens.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a commonality of interest because
                there are still working-class people in the Shankill Road, in
                Mid-Ulster, in the Bogside and in West Belfast. The
                working-class are the strongest supporters of the peace process
                and these people are telling the Members to cut out the
                nonsense.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We know what is in the Good Friday Agreement.
                It is very clear. Sinn Fein discussed the issue of
                decommissioning with the British and Irish Governments in the
                run-in to the agreement and they took a very sensible view as to
                how the Assembly should deal with this particular issue. The
                Governments recognised, as de Klerk recognised in South Africa,
                that the issue of decommissioning should not be allowed to hold
                up the peace process. This is the approach that is catered for
                in the agreement document.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It does not say anywhere in the agreement
                that Sinn Fein cannot enter the Executive Committee unless there
                is decommissioning. But the object of the exercise, as far as
                Sinn Fein is concerned, is to decommission the injustices and
                inequalities of the past and to decommission all the British and
                Irish guns.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Birnie:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGuinness speaks about decommissioning
                and the South African precedent. Does he agree that South Africa
                now has the highest statistical murder rate in the world? Does
                that not demonstrate that leaving substantial stockpiles of
                weaponry in a divided society is a recipe for disaster?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr M McGuinness:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I accept that there are very great problems
                and difficulties in South Africa. I have not said that both
                situations are exactly the same. There is a lot of crime in
                South Africa, many guns and much criminality — there is no
                question or doubt about that. But de Klerk, who was acknowledged
                along with Nelson&nbsp;Mandela as one of the main architects of
                the peace process in South Africa, said that if he had insisted
                on decommissioning of weapons by the African National Congress,
                they would not have had the peace process. This process has now
                provided South Africa with the launching pad for dealing with
                political, social and economic issues and issues of criminality.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Ulster Unionist Party is dealing with
                this issue in a very sensible way. Some parties do not want to
                face the process of conflict resolution; they do not want to
                face the reality that the best way to take British and Irish
                guns out of Irish politics is to remove all of the causes of
                injustice. This is what peace processes are all about. The
                question then becomes whether the Assembly believes that Sinn
                Fein is genuine. The Democratic Unionist Party will never accept
                Sinn Fein as being for real — I wish they would. I want to be
                friends with them. Some people within Ulster Unionism are
                dealing with this particular issue in a very sensible way.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must press on with the implementation of
                the agreement. We have been informed that there will be a
                North/South Ministerial Council meeting before the end of this
                month, or possibly at the beginning of October. The big question
                for us has to be who will represent the Assembly on that
                Council. If the Assembly is represented by
                Mr&nbsp;David&nbsp;Trimble and Mr Seamus Mallon, it will not be
                properly represented. The agreement states, under the heading
                &quot;Executive Authority&quot;, that that is to be discharged
                on behalf of the Assembly by a First Minister and Deputy First
                Minister and up to 10&nbsp;Ministers with departmental
                responsibilities. That is what we have to implement; we have to
                show people that we intend to deal with all the different
                aspects of life on this island that directly affect them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The people of Mid&nbsp;Ulster are waiting
                with trepidation to hear an announcement from the Northern
                Health and Social Services Board on Thursday 17 September 1998
                about whether the Mid&nbsp;Ulster Hospital is to be run down or
                closed. I recently attended meetings with the Department of
                Education about the prospect of the closure of schools in Mid
                Ulster, and I am sure that every constituency represented here
                shares these problems and difficulties. That is the argument for
                appointing Ministers as quickly as possible — and Mr Durkan is
                absolutely correct. The structures and Ministers should be put
                in place, and those Ministers should rise to the occasion and
                fulfil their responsibilities under the agreement by moving
                forward decisively and giving the type of leadership that all of
                our people crave for.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Farren:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In complimenting the First Minister
                (Designate) and the Deputy First Minister (Designate) on their
                report, I would like to express to them the appreciation of the
                people of the North Antrim constituency for their concern and
                compassion following the terrible tragedy when the young Quinn
                brothers were so cruelly murdered. Their support and concern,
                particularly for the people of Ballymoney where the Quinn family
                lived, has been deeply appreciated.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to focus on one aspect of the report,
                the North/South Council. I look forward to the establishment of
                that council, not least because I have my origins in the South.
                I look forward to a council which will work to ensure stronger
                links between both parts of the island in particular, of course,
                for people of the Nationalist tradition. The council will
                represent, in a particularly symbolic way, their relationships
                and their affiliation with the rest of the people on the island.
                It will also represent and embody relationships which stretch
                right across our communities here in the North with all of the
                people in the South.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those of us who participated in the
                transition programme last week will recall the very open
                acknowledgement made by some of the Southern contributors. For
                too long the South had all but ignored relationships and forms
                of co-operation with the North, apart from particular
                initiatives like the Erne Hydro Electric Scheme, the Foyle
                Fisheries, and the management of the Belfast/Dublin Railway. But
                since the Anglo-Irish Agreement in 1985 a very significant
                transformation has taken place with respect to co-operation
                between both parts of the island.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since then, many initiatives have taken place
                over the years, some with European Union and International Fund
                for Ireland support, and these initiatives have ranged across
                virtually all social, economic and cultural domains. As we
                prepare for a new era of co-operation, it is appropriate to pay
                tribute to those behind these initiatives, those who have funded
                them and who have put the structures in place to help them
                operate. As a result, communities and enterprises in the public
                and private sectors, from both parts of the island, have
                benefited from the co-operation and pioneering work that has
                been taking place.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The establishment of the council will mean
                that future co-operation will be directed and enhanced, and much
                of it will be implemented within a political framework. This
                will bring a new openness, transparency and accountability to
                these initiatives and that will ensure the maximum benefit from
                resources and the potential of people in both parts of the
                island.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In identifying the areas of council
                responsibility, the Social Democratic and Labour Party believes
                that there are two fundamental requirements to be recognised:
                first, the overall social, economic and cultural context;
                secondly, the potential for ongoing development. Simply
                selecting areas at random, or because of minimal cost and ease
                of operation, without regard to the wider context or to existing
                forms of co-operation or to the possibilities for growth would
                be mere window dressing. Identifying key areas for the council’s
                initial remit must begin with existing forms of co-operation. In
                agriculture, these range across matters such as food safety,
                animal and plant health, stock breeding and wildlife management
                and protection to close contacts and joint initiatives under
                European Union programmes.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to implementation bodies, and in
                particular on the subject of health, some Members may be aware
                that Northern&nbsp;Ireland’s top cancer surgeon,
                Mr&nbsp;Roy&nbsp;Spence, and the professor of oncology at Queen’s
                University, Prof&nbsp;Patrick&nbsp;Johnston, made a joint
                proposal some weeks before the Good Friday Agreement. The
                proposal was on co-operation on cancer between the authorities
                in the North of Ireland and those in the Republic. Next to
                cardiovascular disease, there are more people dying from cancer
                on this island than from any other condition. From their
                viewpoint there is no reason, when millions of pounds are spent
                on cancer research, why there could not be co-operation in that

                existing forms of co-operation and the potential for development
                that lies therein. There are many possibilities, with respect to
                overall strategic planning, in connection with each of the 12.

                potential for development contained within those existing forms
                of co-operation, that the most effective implementation bodies

                parts of Ireland, the real test of their efficacy will be the
                extent to which they promote closer bonds between our people and
                their communities. Those bonds will reflect deeper levels of
                mutual understanding, respect and reconciliation between Irish
                men and Irish women of all traditions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Social Democratic and Labour Party
                recognises and has taken note of the concern that has been
                expressed about progress towards the establishment of the
                North/South Council. We want to see all of the steps which must
                be taken in the Assembly taken without delay, particularly the
                establishment of its Executive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the agreement itself there is provision
                for the First Minister (Designate) and Deputy First Minister
                (Designate) to advance and to co-ordinate responses from this
                Assembly with external bodies such as the North/South Council.
                We welcome the steps that they are already taking, as outlined
                in the report, and I hope that the Assembly will soon be in a
                position to ensure that an inaugural meeting of the Executive
                can go ahead. In this way we can initiate all the forms of
                co-operation and implementation bodies as foreseen in the Good
                Friday Agreement.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Paisley Jnr:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When we come to this time of the year we are
                reminded of a new term; a fresh start; a new beginning. Some of
                us are parents who may have left our children to school,
                possibly for the first time. This year there is an expectation
                that there will be progress, that there will be a report.
                Certainly this Assembly has had an expectation over the last 12
                weeks that there would be a report. We are told that we have got
                a report, but it is a very skimpy one. Indeed, if the report was
                to describe the progress of one of our offspring we would
                probably say &quot;Could do better.&quot; In fact, we could say
                it was a failed report.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has been much progress over the summer
                in other areas. For instance, progress was made on this Chamber
                and many Members have referred to our beautiful and elaborate
                surroundings. They have commended the workmen, people who were
                once the targets of individuals in this Assembly because they
                worked on Her Majesty’s buildings. We congratulate those
                workmen on their efforts.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has also been progress outside
                the&nbsp;Assembly, in the degenerative sense, in terms
                of&nbsp;terrorism. Since Good Friday, since the agreement and
                the so-called new dawn, the &quot;New Beginning&quot;, there has
                been the progress of Tony&nbsp;Blair’s agreement, Bertie&nbsp;Ahern’s
                agreement, David&nbsp;Trimble’s agreement, Seamus&nbsp;Mallon’s
                agreement, Gerry&nbsp;Adams’s agreement. But what has that
                progress been? Some 691 people have been put in hospital because
                of paramilitary violence; more than 37 people have been
                butchered and murdered by terrorism; 48 people have been shot
                and brutalised by paramilitary organisations; and there have
                been six car bombs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of course, there has been much more. In my
                constituency little children have been burnt to death because of
                violence and terrorism. Oh yes, the terrorists have been very
                busy over the last 12 weeks. I am glad to see that in the case
                of the Quinn murders, the police seem to have made some
                progress. Sub judice prevents me from saying anything further on
                that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is sad that the security forces do not
                appear to have made the same progress in capturing the people
                who were involved in the other violence that I mentioned. I
                think that we will see a very familiar pattern just as we did
                after the Enniskillen bomb. All the flurry, the excitement dies
                away. It is buried and forgotten, and nobody is caught,
                convicted and put into jail. Even if they were put into jail,
                would they stay there for very long? The people who support this
                agreement believe in a principle that politics means there can
                be expediency when it comes to convictions that people can get
                out of jail early, no matter what the heinous crime.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In terms of the interim report, the Assembly
                tasked the First and Deputy First Ministers (Designate) to
                construct basic structures and to prepare for the establishment
                of the British/Irish Council and so on, but they have failed to
                produce anything of substance.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has been some progress in other areas.
                There have been jobs for the boys and promises that certain
                people can expect certain posts. There is the expectation that
                certain schools in certain areas might get some more money
                because certain individuals are now well-placed in this
                Assembly. Certain hospitals might gain because they happen to be
                in certain individuals’ constituencies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have heard all the promises, and we can
                read between the lines. The general public can see for
                themselves that the new faces, the new functionaries, the new
                policies will probably create a Northern Ireland which, far from
                being at ease with itself, will continue to have that tension,
                concern and unease that has been generated by terrorism for the
                past 30&nbsp;years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I listened with some interest to
                Mr&nbsp;Nesbitt’s comments. In a Jimmy&nbsp;Carter-style
                address he said that he had spoken to a young person who had
                told him many things, and that he, Mr&nbsp;Nesbitt, now intends
                to use that talk as empirical evidence to move forward his
                policies. Mr&nbsp;Nesbitt said that he commends the report. This
                skimpy report, which Mr&nbsp;Nesbitt commends to this House, is
                incomplete. It does not contain proposals, so Mr&nbsp;Nesbitt is
                commending nothing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When my party’s delegation met the First
                and Deputy First Ministers (Designate) we spent some time
                talking about the detailed outline proposal which had been
                placed before all the parties. As we went through that proposal,
                the two Ministers decided to move away from the contents of that
                document. They told us their ideas for a form of local
                government, for the reform of the Civil Service and even for
                tax-raising powers. It seems that these people have been given a
                task, and they are not prepared to get on and do it. They are
                looking at a whole lot of other tasks instead, but they should
                concentrate on the matter at hand. They have been given power
                and they do not know what to do with it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not believe that what is in this skimpy
                report nor that the agreement that is the basis for it will lead
                to good government for Northern Ireland. It will lead to bad
                government. The Sinn Fein/IRA Member Mr&nbsp;McGuinness said
                that because of the stance taken by the leader of the Ulster
                Unionist Party, there is more support than ever for the
                agreement. There may be more support within the Republican
                movement, within Nationalism, but there is declining support for
                the agreement within the Unionist community. That is not just my
                view, it is the view of the Ulster Unionist Party.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The minutes of a meeting held in this
                building on 6&nbsp;August show that Mr&nbsp;Nesbitt said to
                Mr&nbsp;Ingram</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;I am livid with Her Majesty’s
                Government – Sinn Fein must be told that the process will move
                on without them – we have nothing left to give.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He did not say that to Sinn Fein today. There
                will be another broken promise because in a matter of weeks Mr
                Trimble will give Sinn Fein places in the Government of Northern
                Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Member from my constituency has claimed
                that the Unionist vote is wavering and that there is a real risk
                of civil war. He said that the Unionists need something to keep
                some faith with the electorate. We also have Mr Empey’s
                earlier quotation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister and Deputy First Ministers
                (Designate) ought to confirm that there are great divisions
                between them. They are partners in government who cannot agree
                on the fundamentals of decommissioning, on when and how it
                should take place, or on who should have executive powers in the
                proposed Government of Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Things are not good for the Union or for this
                country because of the agreement and the political landscape
                ahead of us. Many people are talking about peace. No one craves
                that more than my generation. Peace, however, is not solely
                about the absence of conflict, which we do not yet have. It is
                about the presence of justice, honesty, integrity and democracy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The process that is now being established,
                that is rolling forward and being given a fair wind by Ulster
                Unionists, who ought to know better, is leading us not towards
                greater peace, but towards an acceptable level of peace. We had
                acceptable levels of violence in the past, but they were
                unacceptable. Now we are to have an acceptable level of peace,
                but that will not be real peace.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Someone earlier referred to &quot;solid

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A consultative Civic Forum will be of great
                value in assisting the Assembly discharge its responsibilities
                under the agreement. If properly constituted, it will be the
                opposite of the undemocratic quangos which we have already heard
                so much about, and which were the brainchild of the former
                Tory&nbsp;Government. Their members were appointed by Tory
                Ministers and, on the whole, represented the well-heeled
                tradition. The Civic Forum has the capacity, for the first time,
                to include civic society in a truly transparent manner and to
                influence the Assembly’s deliberations for the benefit of all
                the people of this island.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those in the Chamber who are arrogant enough
                to think that, because they have been elected, they do not need
                to listen continually to the people or to be open to the
                suggestions of such a Forum, are not fit for governance, and
                they certainly are not, and should not be, part of any
                democracy. I suggest that the First Minister (Designate) and the
                Deputy First Minister (Designate) consider in a very proactive
                manner how to put in place a Civic Forum that will include the
                voluntary community, the business sector, the trade union sector
                and the young people that Mr&nbsp;Nesbitt spoke of. That is
                vital.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support Prof McWilliams and my colleague
                Mrs&nbsp;de&nbsp;Brún on the issue of the North/South Council.
                It has not been dealt with in this report; it has been fudged.
                We need to know how it will be constituted and when it will
                meet.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I say to Mr&nbsp;Taylor that it is not
                surprising that the North of Ireland did well in the
                Commonwealth Games in the shooting events when there are 133,000
                legally held guns here, most of which are at the disposal of his
                community. When we speak of decommissioning in terms of the
                agreement, we should have the objective of creating a society
                where all guns are removed, a society that reflects inclusion,
                equality and democracy.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have very little time, so I will speak very
                briefly about the Civic Forum. It will add a very important
                dimension to the fledgling democracy and new dispensation that
                we are about to enter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Forum is a welcome development which will
                establish a truly inclusive democracy and will provide an
                interface between the public and the decision makers. The
                expertise which the various sectoral interests can offer — <i>[Interruption]</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When women begin to speak some gentlemen in
                the Chamber feel free to begin a free-for-all.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As decision-makers, we face difficult
                challenges and choices, and will have to face conflicting
                interests. The insights that the various sectoral interests can
                give us will be very important and helpful to us in reaching
                informed decisions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The point that I want to make very clearly
                — and Mr Taylor referred to this earlier — is that the
                Confederation of British Industry is not necessarily
                representative of all business interests. Other organisations
                have traditionally represented the various interests in Northern
                Ireland. They are not any longer necessarily truly or totally
                representative of those interests, and we should be aware of
                that when we look at the areas that have been mentioned in the
                agreement, such as business, the trade unions and the voluntary
                sector.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should recognise that when these
                organisations come together in the various fora, there is often
                a great imbalance and the sectors that are often left out most
                particularly consist of women, who represent more than 50% of
                this society but are under-represented in most of these fora. We
                need to address that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is also a need to address the lack of
                representation of the most vulnerable sectors of our society —
                the elderly, the disabled, the unemployed and, of course, as Mrs
                Nelis mentioned, young people. It is important for all those
                people to be involved in the Civic Forum, and mechanisms must be
                found to involve them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The challenge before us is daunting, but in
                an accountable democracy a fully inclusive and representative
                Civic Forum will ensure that we come to our difficult decisions
                in an informed manner and with an awareness of the needs and the
                views of all sections of this society, because none of us has a

                this very long debate there were many who wished to speak. Not
                all could, but I have tried to keep a degree of proportionality
                and at the same time give all parties an opportunity to put
                forward their views. We are all learning in this process, and I
                am grateful to those who have been helpful and accommodating.</p>
