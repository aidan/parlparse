    <p class="H4StageHeading">Petition of Concern: Caravans Bill</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I advise the House that a valid petition of concern was presented yesterday,  Monday 24 January, in relation to the third group of amendments that have been  published for today&rsquo;s Consideration Stage of the Caravans Bill. Amendment Nos  12, 13, 14 and 15, which make up group three, concern exemptions from licensing  of sites. As the petition was presented yesterday, votes on those amendments  will be decided on a cross-community basis and can be taken today.</p>
    <p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="b"></a>Ministerial Statement</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Northern    Ireland Housing Executive: Review of  Governance</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I have received notice from the Minister for Social Development that he wishes  to make a statement to the House.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development (Mr Attwood)</strong>: Members will recall that I made a  statement to the Assembly on 11 October 2010 announcing a fundamental review of  the Northern Ireland Housing Executive (NIHE). That work is ongoing, and an  interim report is expected by March. At that time, I also advised that,  following receipt of information about a series of allegations and  investigations into how Housing Executive staff discharged their duties, I  wanted to be satisfied, as I am sure Members will want to be, that the Housing  Executive board&rsquo;s governance systems are working effectively and that its staff  operational systems are applied consistently.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At that time, I also decided that the permanent secretary  should ask his internal auditor to lead a team to examine and to report on  whether the appropriate information and structure is available to the board to  ensure that it does, and can, effectively identify and manage risk; prevent and  detect fraud and error; hold senior managers to account; and ensure that the  organisation operates, and will operate, at the highest standards of corporate  governance. The team will look at whether adequate controls are used to manage  risk; the prevention and detection of fraud and error; performance, procurement  and asset disposal, including in relation to land and property; and the  procurement of repairs, maintenance, miscellaneous works and adaptations. The  team will consider whether the organisation has, or can have, access to  appropriately skilled and trained staff to allow it to operate in its current  form while preparing for, and implementing, both organisational and cultural  change. The team will also examine whether the seven principles of public life  &mdash; selflessness, integrity, objectivity, accountability, openness, honesty and  leadership &mdash; are being implemented effectively throughout the organisation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A major part of the review was carried out by a team of  Northern Ireland Civil Service specialists, headed by the Department&rsquo;s senior  internal auditor. In addition, external specialist assistance was secured  through the Department of Finance and Personnel&rsquo;s Central Procurement  Directorate for a gateway review of procedures for letting and managing Egan  contracts, including controls over the prevention and detection of fraud and  error. The gateway review was carried out by independent experts in that field.  Moreover, the audit review team reported on an ongoing basis to an oversight  panel, which was chaired by the permanent secretary and included independent  membership. The purpose of that architecture was to provide a quick, robust,  searching assessment of where NIHE was on contracts and governance and,  critically, where it needed to be.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I first wish to address the gateway review, which was part  of the twin-track review of the Housing Executive since October 2010. The  gateway review was a dedicated and accelerated piece of work over a five-day  period. It was a health check review of the Housing Executive&rsquo;s programme of  maintenance, repairs, support works and adaptations for Egan contracts. At its  first meeting of the new year, I briefed the Social Development Committee on  the broad contents of the gateway review, and a copy of the review report was  forwarded to the Committee on Friday 21 January.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As regards the gateway review of procedures for letting and  managing Egan contracts, the specialist team considered it important to record  that it was evident to them that NIHE is driven by a strong desire to deliver a  high-quality service to its tenants and to gain equally high levels of  satisfaction from tenants for the service delivered. The board and senior  management at the Housing Executive have embraced the need for ensuring that  the procedures in place reflect best practice. However, it must be said that  extensive transformation is required.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is useful to note that a major change in management  style was effected with the move to Egan contracts. The gateway review team  found that, since the early part of this century, the day-to-day contract  management of suppliers has been and is conducted in an appropriately  non-adversarial manner that is consistent with good practice. However, the team  concluded &mdash; and this is crucial &mdash; that the culture of non-adversarial  management as the primary technique for managing contractor behaviour has  created a weakness in the system that will need to be addressed. That is the  extensive transformation to which I just referred.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Fourteen recommendations have been made, and they include  that the Housing Executive produces and adopts a new corporate procurement  vision and strategy; that all future contracts be drafted on the basis of the  detail set out in the procurement strategies and that a report be produced to  confirm that they meet the need and, in so far as can be determined, will be  enforceable; and that the contract manager ensure that processes are put in  place to recognise and to collect the evidence that may be needed to enforce  any provision of the contract.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I now wish to spend a short time considering some of the  recommendations. The gateway review team&rsquo;s approach was fundamental, as can be  witnessed from its very first recommendation, which is that NIHE produces and  adopts a new corporate procurement vision and strategy, and from its series of  sequential recommendations. In particular, recommendation E:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;We recommend that &hellip; attention is given to the form  (detailed terms and conditions) so that the contract enables effective and  enforceable management to be delivered.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The reason for that recommendation was acknowledged  in the following sentences:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;governance surrounding contract management was poor&rdquo;;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">and,</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;there was a poor understanding of what needed to, or  could be, done to instigate more formal contract management processes when a  contractor was performing consistently badly.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The report rightly acknowledges that the procurement team  of the Northern Ireland Housing Executive has a strong understanding of the  procurement process and that its approach is sound, well managed and:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;best practice from the point of view of probity and  risk management.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The report also comments that the Egan approach was  grounded in a partnership approach between the public body and the contractor.  That principle is important; it has its place and creates a non-adversarial  environment. Crucially, however, the report says that contract management:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;has become reliant on the effectiveness of  relationships with contractors&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I intend to address that point at some length as it is at  the heart of the gateway report. All 14 recommendations are fully informed by  that analysis, and the future should be strictly informed by it. The point is  developed with the gateway review assessment of key performance indicators  (KPIs). The Northern Ireland Housing Executive suggests that KPIs had become  &ldquo;the most significant control&rdquo; over contracts and contractors. The gateway  report did not accept that as the case under the current control regime, with  KPI levels not embedded in the most recently issued tender.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Indeed, recommendations I and H state that KPIs &ldquo;will not  be enough to cover&rdquo; any complex contracts currently being tendered. That  important point is developed in the penultimate paragraphs of part 6 of the  gateway review, which offers three options to contracts currently being  tendered. The review states:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The options are:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">For the contracts to continue and negotiations post contract  with successful suppliers to reduce the risk;</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">For the contracts to be adapted as well as possible in  the time available and to proceed with a reduced but present risk;</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">For the contract process to be delayed until later in  2011 with an extension of the existing contracts so that appropriate time can  be given to improving the procurement&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That is an essential point: contracts are being  tendered, but the process does not satisfy the recommendations of the gateway  review. Consequently, I agree with the review that contracts currently out for  tender should become a baseline for future contractual arrangements. Legal  advice confirms that it is proper to delay the contract renewal process until  later in 2011, with a short extension of existing contracts until the  initiation of a new tender process, as informed by the gateway review  recommendations, which will lead to a new regime of contract management,  compliance and enforcement.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That is the way forward. I am determined that a new  discipline and rigour should be applied to contracts. That is necessary to  protect tenants&rsquo; needs, the Housing Executive&rsquo;s authority, the interests of the  Department for Social Development (DSD), and government expenditure. It is necessary  to draw a clear line between the practice of yesterday and a better way for the  future.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I stress that the 14 recommendations must be implemented in  real time. As a demonstration of that approach, existing contracts will be  extended for a short period while a new tender and contract process is  developed that reflects and honours faithfully the recommendations of the  gateway review team.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The second part of the intervention that I announced last  autumn was a wider governance review of the Northern Ireland Housing Executive.  Its purpose was self-evident: to give me, as Minister, and, I trust, the  Committee for Social Development and the Assembly, the reassurance that the  Northern Ireland Housing Executive will work effectively across a number of  important areas in the immediate future.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As Members know, a series of internal and external  investigations into the Housing Executive raised concerns that its governance  systems were not sufficiently robust. The audit and governance report is a  result of my intervention last autumn. It runs to 177 pages, including a  lengthy appendix and 75 recommendations, and, like the gateway review, it is a  comprehensive piece of work. Its content and conclusion confirm that the  intervention last autumn was necessary, proportionate and timely.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">10.45 am</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I said, the report contains 75 recommendations, 16 of  which relate to &ldquo;critical control issues&rdquo;, which is a term used by the audit  team, with 59 relating to developing existing policies and practices so that  latest best practice can be embraced. I have accepted all the recommendations  in full and without doubt.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The report acknowledges that there is &ldquo;much evidence of  good practice&rdquo;. It also acknowledges that Housing Executive:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;management are being challenged and held to account&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">and that the board has &ldquo;appropriate structures&rdquo; to  effectively detail and manage risk.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, the review team identified a range of critical  control issues that weaken the governance structures and their effective  operation. Recommendations on those include developing formal terms of  reference for the board and all management committees, conducting a  comprehensive review of the board&rsquo;s standing orders and scheme of delegations,  and reviewing risk management arrangements.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are also a number of recommendations on land and  property and on the procurement of repairs, maintenance, miscellaneous works  and adaptations. For example, although the control framework that the Housing  Executive established provides adequate controls over performance of  maintenance works and the prevention and detection of fraud and error, there  are a number of areas where controls could be strengthened. Those include  recommendations on the level of information that is provided to the Housing  Executive&rsquo;s board and to the chief executive&rsquo;s business committee, greater use  of the repairs inspection unit, and a review of the KPIs that are used to  measure the performance of contractors. That point was obviously touched on in  the gateway review process.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Northern Ireland Housing Executive has a number of  effective human resources systems and processes in place, but there is  imbalance in the workforce, particularly where the age profile of the  organisation is concerned. Indeed, that has been debated in the Chamber before.  If that imbalance is not addressed, a risk will be created that the  organisation will lose significant knowledge, skills and experience. That point  was made about the reform of another organisation in the past 15 years.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will comment briefly on a number of the recommendations.  The corporate governance recommendations are a pathway to enhance the capacity  of the board and its structures. They are the right disciplines for any  significant organisation to be in the right place when it comes to its conduct.  The response maintenance recommendations are a broader narrative of the gateway  report. I refer particularly to recommendations 41 and 42, and I consider  recommendation 42 to be critical. It says that the Housing Executive should  review its procedures for the inspection of response maintenance, including  whether the size sampling is adequate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The human resources recommendations are good management  practice, and the recommendations on the seven principles of public life are  important. They include conclusions to be drawn when current internal and  external investigations are complete. Bearing in mind the scale of potential  disposal, the asset disposal recommendations are an important group. The  disciplines and processes for asset disposal must be in place, as should those  for response and planned maintenance. I do not intend to comment further on  this part of the report, although I will answer questions on it. It is of a  significant scale, and it places substantial responsibility on the Housing  Executive and DSD.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I think that several conclusions can be drawn from the  reports, although that list is not exhaustive. First, it was necessary, and  this has been proven to be the case, for me to commission the governance and  gateway reports, respectively. The reports cover a range of territory and have  been conducted and completed with considerable expediency and good practice. In  their totality, and with full implementation, they offer a way forward. I  acknowledge the work of both the teams that went into the Housing Executive.  They had to act quickly, probe deeply and draw the right conclusions. In my  view, the teams that went in, as well as the external oversight team, which was  managed by the permanent secretary and included an independent expert,  demonstrated what can be done very quickly to assess public bodies and to  create the architecture and processes to put them in a better place.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, it is essential that all the reports&rsquo;  recommendations are fully implemented, and are seen to be implemented, to  ensure that best practice in governance and contract management prevails and  confidence deepens. That is required without prejudice to the ongoing  fundamental review of the Northern Ireland Housing Executive. Independent of  the longer-term conclusions of the fundamental review, the shorter-term life of  the Housing Executive must be informed, inter alia, by the two reports. That is  why I have been provided with a draft implementation plan and why the Housing  Executive is required to have a final plan endorsed by its board in February.  Thereafter, I will forward the final implementation plan to the Committee for  Social Development for its information.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Thirdly, the Housing Executive board and DSD must ensure  that implementation occurs expeditiously and faithfully. I have accepted the  reports and their recommendations in full, save, with the consent of DSD, the  gateway review team or the oversight group, a rare exception where the  recommendation might be slightly varied.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the endorsement of the reports by the chairperson  and acting chief executive of the Housing Executive. However, my judgment is  that the objective of quick and faithful implementation requires a level of  oversight that is outside the jurisdiction of the board of the Housing  Executive. That is why I am putting in place a new level of oversight through  meetings every two months between the chairperson and vice chairperson of the  board, its senior managers and me, as Minister; monthly meetings between the  Housing Executive and the DSD permanent secretary and senior officials; and,  critically, a panel of three people, chaired by the permanent secretary, with  expertise in overseeing that important work. That latter decision borrows from  a similar model that was deployed during the recent review, and it will include  an independent person with expertise in providing a challenge function.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Fourthly, as was recommended by the gateway review, I shall  invite the gateway team to conduct a short review of the NIHE implementation  plan. I intend that that shall be done in advance of the plan going to the  board of the Housing Executive in February.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Fifthly, I have instructed my permanent secretary to assess  the conclusions of the gateway review against other contracts that are the  responsibility of DSD. The Egan model is not particular to the Housing  Executive. It emerged from considerations in the 1990s that saw Egan-type  contracts being introduced across public bodies generally. Therefore, it might  be possible to apply the gateway review recommendations to other DSD contracts.  If it is possible, we should do so.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Sixthly, arising from the gateway review, if there can be  application to contracts anywhere in government, we should do so. That is why I  am copying the gateway review to the Minister of Finance and Personnel for his  consideration. The permanent secretary of DSD has raised the report with the  Central Procurement Directorate to determine whether it could be more widely  applied to government contracts and considered by the panel of secretaries that  deals with procurement matters.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In recognition of the issues that were commented on in the  media, the Assembly and elsewhere, there was a need for a quick and robust  response by DSD. In doing so, I followed the lead of my predecessor in the  Department, Margaret Ritchie, who, during her time in office, demonstrated  resolve and rigour around housing issues, including the new oversight regime  for the business of housing associations and her initiatives to deal with  issues that touched on the Housing Executive. This is an important point: when  the previous Minister went into office, she enhanced the size of the housing  division in DSD by 100% because she identified that there was a need for a more  interventionist approach that was consistent with good evidence and due process  for housing in Northern    Ireland. The fact that a number of housing  associations are suspended from the newbuild programme and the other issues  that are ongoing in respect of housing associations, for example, is a  consequence of the oversight and governance regime that drills down into the  life of housing associations. That regime was put in place by my predecessor.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Housing has been a success story of the past 40 years.  However, it requires reform in a positive image. My decisions are a  demonstration of my belief that that is what we need to do. This statement is a  further demonstration of where we need to go. I trust that colleagues across  the Chamber will endorse my approach.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Social Development (Mr Hamilton)</strong>: I thank the Minister  for his statement. It contains many issues about which he and I share concern.  I particularly welcome his final paragraph. Everyone on this side of the House  would agree that there is a need for ongoing positive reform across the housing  sector in Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Both reports refer to the procurement and management of  contracts by the Housing Executive. Worryingly, the gateway review indicates  that key performance indicators were demonstrably too low and that contractual  requirements were apparently not enforced by the Housing Executive. The review  also appears to suggest that changes were made to contract documentation  without legal oversight, which, apparently, could make contracts less  enforceable. Will the Minister explain how the contracts situation arose and  inform us of the cost of that to the taxpayer, if it has been quantified yet?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, will the Minister indicate whether, in his  view, some of the Housing Executive&rsquo;s shortcomings in managing its contractors  led to the poor performance that some Members and individuals across Northern Ireland  experienced during the recent cold snap? Finally, the Minister outlined some  changes to the governance of the Housing Executive, particularly to the  monitoring of that governance. Notwithstanding the ongoing fundamental review,  will he assure the House that he will not shy away from further change to the governance  of the Housing Executive if, indeed, it proves to be necessary?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank the Chairperson of the Committee for Social  Development for those questions. In particular, I welcome his recognition of  the need for the reform in a positive image of the housing sector in Northern Ireland.  I shall make a number of comments.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">First, I will not shy away from or shirk the responsibility  for driving reform. The one thing about which I was convinced before coming  into this job, because of my past experience and responsibilities, and which  has affirmed my views since, is the need for reform in a positive image of a  wide range of public services and wider life in Northern Ireland. I am utterly  convinced about it. That is not to discount or diminish the very significant  contribution made by public bodies in the past 20, 30 and 40 years. In very  adverse circumstances, the contribution of the leadership of public bodies, and  a number of public bodies in particular, to moving Northern Ireland forward, keeping  it stable and dealing with issues of need and disadvantage should, in my view,  be acknowledged and applauded. However, just because we did business in that  way in the past does not mean that it is the way in which we need to do it in  the future. Whether it involves the Housing Executive, housing associations or  a wide range of other organisations, such as the Belfast Harbour Commissioners,  we need a new phase of deep reform in a positive image. I do not mean reform in  the image promoted by the Tories, which causes strain and stress. I mean reform  that will liberate organisations and people so that they can deliver in an even  better way for people in Northern    Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member asked about how that situation arose, which is  an important question. Indeed, in the gateway review and, more particularly, in  the governance review, one of the tasks set in the recommendations was to find  out why certain things were managed in the way in which they were. For example,  the Housing Executive is obliged to answer a question about a 2007 report that  was meant to, but did not, go to an audit committee. The answer to that  question will reveal why, as the Member indicated, certain things arose. I have  part of that answer. In that case, a senior manager in the Housing Executive  and people on the audit side of the Housing Executive had a difference of views  about the critical issue of how a paper going to the audit committee should be  managed. In that moment and in that difference of view, a process that, in my  view, should have been followed through was not. Consequently, a report on how  to manage certain affairs did not go to the audit committee until late in 2010,  three years after the matter first arose.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Whilst I have asked the Housing Executive to indicate  in more detail how that situation arose, people can see that, in the Housing  Executive, the balance of relationships and the balance of authority between,  on one hand, the senior management team and, on the other hand, the board and  its structures needed to be reconfigured. That is what those reports tend to  do.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.00 am</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member asked a legitimate question: does the gateway  review give some insight into the management of heating and other contracts  over the past month during the cold weather? That is a fair question and one  that I asked myself, the Housing Executive and the Department. Was that a  contributory factor to the difficulties that the Housing Executive had in the  initial phase of response? My answer to that is two-tiered. Yes, there may be a  shadow over the response of contractors to the cold weather that arose over the  past month in the initial phase, and there may be a shadow over the gateway  observations on how they handled the situation. However, on the other hand &mdash;  this is the more substantial point &mdash; we demonstrated over the Christmas period  that, although there were issues with the initial response and the initial  performance of contractors, that situation was, in my view, substantially  turned round because of hands-on management from the Department and the Housing  Executive to ensure that, as fully as possible, contractors fulfilled the tens  of thousands of contract orders that were placed over that time. Therefore,  although there are clearly issues with contract management and contractor  performance &mdash; that covers the full range of Housing Executive contractors &mdash; the  hands-on, active and robust management of contractor performance, particularly  after the weakness of the initial phase of response by the Housing Executive,  demonstrated that we can turn a situation that was not as good as it should  have been into a much better situation.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his statement.  It is incumbent on the Minister &mdash; I appreciate that the Chairperson raised the  issue &mdash; to come to the House with a statement on the failures over the  Christmas period. It is not only members of the Social Development Committee  who have concerns about that; I am sure that members of his own party were  lobbied about it over Christmas.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have more questions about the Minister&rsquo;s statement, as I  am sure others do. They will proceed as they get into the detail. Given that,  on appearance, there was no relationship between the Housing Executive and Land  and Property Services, can the Minister clarify whether part of that ongoing  review involves the disposal of land? Can he also advise whether features or  elements of this investigation are connected to the issue that is subject to  the internal and external investigation that is under way?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Lastly, I find it extraordinary that, on his party&rsquo;s watch  and almost at the end of its tenure, it is only now realising that there has  been systemic failure at senior management level of the Housing Executive. That  is absolutely extraordinary.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank the Member for her various observations. When I  came to the House in the autumn to discuss this matter, a member of another  party put it to me that a range of issues in the Housing Executive were not  being handled or managed properly and asked what I, as Minister, was going to  do about it. At that time, I made the point that at virtually no time in the  previous three years and certainly not in any structured, substantial or  evidence-based way, did the member of that party bring to the Housing Executive  or to the then Minister for Social Development, Margaret Ritchie, the point  that Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n has made about what she refers to as systemic failure.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not understand how Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n can say that she finds  it extraordinary that it is only in the latter days of this mandate that the  issues around the Housing Executive, whatever they might be, are being  identified. If her party believed that there was systemic failure over the past  one, two, three or four years, it had an obligation, politically and to its  constituents, to bring that to the attention of the Housing Executive and the  Minister for Social Development, to produce evidence that that was the case and  to demonstrate that publicly and politically on the Floor of the Assembly and  in the Committee for Social Development. Sinn F&eacute;in had an obligation to make  that argument and prove that case, and it did not do so in any substantial,  meaningful, structured, ongoing, reliable or credible way.<span class="Italic"> [Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. You must allow the Minister to continue.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: If people are now saying that there is systemic failure  in the Housing Executive, they should have been saying it six months ago, a  year ago, two years ago, three years ago and four years ago. Earlier, I spoke  about what Margaret Ritchie did as Minister for Social Development. There was a  sense that the housing sector in Northern Ireland had, for one reason or  another, become detached from government and the Department and that, by and  large, it was able to manage its own affairs with less political, ministerial  or Assembly oversight. One of Minister Ritchie&rsquo;s first actions was to create a  new architecture in the Department to address that issue. You do not increase  the size of housing division by 100% if you are not putting down a clear marker  and structures to ensure that there is greater governance and proper  accountability and oversight of the housing sector in Northern Ireland.  All of what we have been able to do since then with the Housing Executive and  housing associations is a consequence of that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member said that there was systemic failure in the  Housing Executive, and I said that that Member and her colleagues had not made  that point in any serious or credible way previously. If there are failures in  any public body &mdash; in this case the Housing Executive &mdash; it is the responsibility  of Ministers who are in government and in power to go about addressing that,  not to stand back and watch emergencies develop and step in long after the  horse has bolted. I demonstrated that responsibility on my watch, building on  the work of Margaret Ritchie. You do not conduct a fundamental review of the  Housing Executive unless you are asking fundamental questions about the way  forward. You do not conduct a rigorous gateway review unless you think that  there are issues around contract management that need to be addressed. You do  not have a governance audit to the extent that we have seen in the report  unless you believe that there are issues and that you will have to drill down  to ensure governance in the short term of the next weeks and months and next  year or two while the fundamental review works itself through.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member might choose the words &ldquo;systemic failure&rdquo;, but  the report says that the Housing Executive has good processes and structures in  place and that there is a challenge function from the board to senior  management but that that is not all that it should be and that, in an  exhaustive and extensive way, we are addressing the failures. I will not use  the words &ldquo;systemic failure&rdquo;. In my view, there were substantial failures that  needed rigorous and robust correction, and that is what we are doing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member asked about the disposal of sites. As she is  undoubtedly indicating, there are references in the reports to the disposal of  sites, especially in the governance report. There are references to the  processes for the disposal of sites generally and the process that applied to  two or three disposals in particular. As I said, I have tasked the Housing  Executive to have an implementation report in respect of all of those matters  endorsed by the February board meeting. I will share that implementation report  with the Committee for Social Development, of which Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n is a member,  and there will be full answers to all of that. However, the Housing Executive  is not waiting for the February board meeting to take those matters forward.  For example, the governance review stated that questions were asked about  possible duplicate invoices, and the Housing Executive is already taking that  matter forward.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Housing Executive put in new systems to ensure that  disposals of whatever value are handled appropriately. It has created a new  principle that there should be a full economic appraisal of all disposals over  &pound;5,000 and another appraisal of any disposals of less than &pound;5,000. The systems  for the information that is given to the board of the Housing Executive and to  the chief executive&rsquo;s committees are already in place. If there are other  issues around the disposal of sites, I reassure the Member that those questions  will be asked and answered.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  I congratulate the Minister on commissioning the report; it shows that he has a  grip on the problem and that he will deal with it properly. It will be  published openly, and that is to be welcomed. The Minister said that the  Housing Executive will implement the recommendations, but when will an  implementation plan be produced, and will it be made available?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank the Member for her question. The reports are  being published, and, drilling down into them, one will see the significant  scale of the recommendations, as well as the acknowledgement of the good  processes, structures and management in the Housing Executive. Some sensitive  matters are subject to investigation and, no doubt, will be of interest to a  wide range of people. Given the importance of this matter, I said that I would  come back to the Assembly on it. The full report should be published and not  redacted so that, as Mrs Bradley said, everybody knows where things are and  where they need to be and to ensure that there is a grip on all of that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have been provided with a draft implementation plan. I  advised the Housing Executive&rsquo;s acting chief executive and his senior managers  that we require an implementation plan that responds fully and in detail to all  the recommendations in both reports and has a timeline for the implementation  of all the recommendations, mindful that many of them are already in place or  are substantially in place. That should all be done in time for the February  board meeting so that a report can come to me and then go to the Committee.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At all times, everything will be subject to external  oversight, initially by the gateway review team looking at the implementation  plan in respect of the recommendations to ensure that they are fit for purpose.  The panel led by the permanent secretary will have an ongoing, hands-on  oversight accountability role for all the recommendations.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his statement. I welcome the two reports and the fact  that they have been done so speedily. I also welcome the Minister&rsquo;s decision to  delay the Egan contract process. Members have received constituency enquiries  about maintenance and repairs work.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister mentioned the implementation plan that,  hopefully, will be agreed in February. How long will the implementation plan  take, and will there be a dedicated monitoring team to ensure that the  implementation actions are taken? Also, how will that impact on the fundamental  review of the Northern Ireland Housing Executive, which will, I hope, report  soon?</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.15 am</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank the Member for her questions. I want to  emphasise her first point, which is that that work was done speedily. It came  to the Assembly in mid-October 2010 and was turned around in good time. No  matter how anyone wants to interpret the content and conclusions of both  reports, they are extensive and exhaustive. They cover all bases and provide a  pathway forward.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The best way to answer the Member&rsquo;s question on how quickly  all of this will be done is to take what I said in my opening statement about  the gateways review&rsquo;s recommendations on contracts. A number of tender  processes for Egan contracts are ongoing. I could let them run their course,  and, at their conclusion, contractors would be appointed to carry out a number  of Egan responsibilities. However, that would be done on the basis of the old  regime, of which the gateway review is critical.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am not prepared to leave it to chance or luck that, at  the end of that process, the disciplines, processes and accountability  recommended by the gateway review would be built into the Egan contracts. That  is why, as I said in my opening statement, the third option outlined in the  concluding paragraphs of the gateway review report is the one that I will take.  That will bring about a new tender process for Egan contracts, which will be  initiated in late summer. That tender process will implement fully and  faithfully the gateway review&rsquo;s recommendation for the partnership model and  will introduce into those contracts all necessary contractual terms and  conditions, enforcement mechanisms and processes to ensure that there is a  robust model that builds on the strengths of partnership and builds in  enforcement disciplines. Between now and late summer, all of that will be done.  With reference to Ms Lo&rsquo;s question, that indicates the importance of the issue  and the timeline.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I dealt with the issue of the dedicated monitoring team,  which is external to the Housing Executive. The Member asked an important  question about how that impacts on the fundamental review. The review is due to  come forward with recommendations during March 2011. That work is ongoing and  substantial. Consultants appointed to do that work are extremely active in  attending to their business. If the fundamental review recommends a  reconfiguration of the Housing Executive&rsquo;s various functions and  responsibilities, that will require discussion in the Assembly, agreement in  the Executive and public consultation, followed by legislation. Unfortunately,  as we know, in the Assembly &mdash; as is also the case in the Scottish Parliament &mdash;  it takes at least two years for an idea or concept to mature into legislation.  Consequently, independent of the fundamental review and any decisions that the  Assembly might make in the fullness of time, the Housing Executive must put in  place, now and in the weeks and months ahead, certainty and reassurance that it  is able to carry out all of its functions, governance, contracts and everything  in between. The fundamental review will make its recommendations, which, I  believe, will be substantial and material. However, in the meantime, we must  ensure that the Housing Executive reassures everyone in the Chamber and, in  particular, its tenants, that, in all ways, it is fit for purpose.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I always encourage Members to come to their questions much sooner. In the  debate, Members have been asking multiple questions. Therefore, quite  obviously, the Minister feels that he must answer them all as far as possible  because, on occasion, Members have accused Ministers of not answering  questions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Standing Orders are clear on ministerial statements: it is  a question to the Minister on his statement. Quite a number of Members want in  on the statement, so let us see if we can come to the question and the answer  much sooner.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his statement. He said:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Crucially, however, the report says that contract  management: &lsquo;has become reliant on the effectiveness of relationships with  contractors&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Will the Minister outline the concerns with the  relationships and the contractors and say why it is highlighted as a major  issue of concern in the report?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank the Member for his question. I try to answer  the questions that are asked; I do not try to pick and choose the easy from the  hard, Mr Speaker. Mr Easton asked one question.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Egan contracts had their birth in two reports in the  1990s. The Egan report was produced in 1998, and it was rolled out in Britain,  particularly in MoD contracts. In the early part of this decade, it was rolled  out in Northern Ireland.  The Egan model has become the version used by the Housing Executive, government  Departments and public bodies in the North.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The theme and mood in public life at that time was that,  rather than government telling people that they had to perform in a certain  way, they were to be encouraged to work in a partnership model. This Chamber,  our Government and our society are testament to the need to have a partnership  model. The partnership model is, therefore, valid and useful. The gateway  report says that the partnership approach became the primary method of managing  the Egan contracts and, therefore, the relationships between the contractor and  the Housing Executive &mdash; and the individuals, the contractor and the Housing  Executive &mdash; were paramount. The quality of the contract was informed and  influenced by the quality of the partnership and relationship, one to the  other. That is what is referred to. The partnership relationship became the  primary mechanism to manage the contract.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The gateway report says that that is not a good model. Even  in its purest sense, Egan is a partnership model, but, at the same time, it has  within it the robust mechanisms to ensure that, where the partnership does not  work, where the contractor is not performing or where the public body &mdash; in this  case, the Housing Executive &mdash; is not able to rail at the contractors about how  they should do their business, there is written into the contract the strict  terms, conditions and enforcement mechanisms that enable action to be taken to  rectify a situation in which the body has been let down. In the case of the  Housing Executive, it has been let down, and the tenant has been let down even  more. That is the point that was being made.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I said to Ms Lo, we are going to extend the existing  contracts for a short time and remodel the contracts to ensure that we welcome  and encourage partnership as a method of dealing with contractors but, at the  same time, put discipline into the contracts to ensure that there are means and  ways of enforcing against any contractor who fails to fulfil the letter or  spirit of the contract, to make sure that they do their job properly. If they  do not, appropriate action will be taken.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his speech. We all hope that the board of the Housing  Executive will be equipped with the tools to challenge all aspects of housing  development and policy at the end of this procedure.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am surprised that the Minister was surprised that there  were serious problems with maintenance contracts in West   Belfast, given that he is a Member for the constituency. Local  community groups met two and a half years ago to discuss this issue and the  local Housing Executive management was completely aware that there were serious  problems in the delivery of maintenance contracts in west Belfast and other places. My colleague was  one of the first people to bring to light the question of the sale &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Is there a question here?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  There is a question somewhere in there. Will the Minister tell us whether the  Egan maintenance contracts have been abused in their delivery by contractors or  Housing Executive officials?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank the Member for his opening remarks. He thanked  me and hoped that, at the end of this procedure &mdash; I do not think it is quite an  operation &mdash; the board of the Housing Executive will be equipped to challenge  its management. As the report states, it does challenge. However, let there be  no doubt about it: it needs to challenge a lot more. I have spent a lot of time  &mdash; some people would say a disproportionate amount of time &mdash; since the first  week in July challenging the Housing Executive board and its senior managers  about how they do many aspects of their business.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I did not use the word &ldquo;surprised&rdquo;, and Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n did  not use the words &ldquo;serious problems&rdquo;. She used the words &ldquo;systemic failure&rdquo;.  That was not about the contracts in west Belfast  but about the Housing Executive per se. If Sinn F&eacute;in wants to make a point, it  should at least make a consistent point. I challenge Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n on her use  of the words &ldquo;systemic failure&rdquo;. There are substantial failures, but I am not  going to beat up the Housing Executive recklessly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In respect of the serious problems with the management of  contracts, not only do I concur with the Member but my predecessor Margaret  Ritchie also concurs with him. It was Margaret Ritchie who went to the Housing  Executive, on the basis of advice and information that she had received, and said  that she believed that the management of certain contracts needed to be  investigated. As I have reported to the Chamber before, an exhaustive and  extensive investigation was initiated and concluded a short while ago. As I  indicated to the Social Development Committee last week, the investigation  report has been passed to the contractor, who has been asked to reply by the  end of the month.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Without prejudice to whether there are serious problems or  not, an argument was made, and, as a consequence, action was taken by Margaret  Ritchie. That process continues. I am not going to speak any further about  that, because there is a process ongoing, and I have to make sure that I am on  the right side of proper process in that matter. However, if there are serious  problems, whether in relation to that matter or any other, let everybody be  reassured that there is more than sufficient proof that, where issues were  identified, action and intervention was taken by me and by my predecessor.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>: I  welcome the fact that the Minister is here reporting back to us, and I welcome  some of the recommendations in the report. I find it interesting that we are  now looking at another level of oversight for the Housing Executive. What I  cannot welcome is the fact that we needed the report. It is a condemnation of  the Housing Executive and the way in which it has managed projects. In relation  to the major projects and the failures that have been highlighted with regard  to servicing those contracts and following up on issues and problems with them,  the one thing that I do not see in the report is how outside bodies, that is, elected  representatives, housing associations &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I encourage the Member to come to his question.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>: &mdash;  other bodies or even tenants are able to report to or give feedback on the  process. That would highlight the difficulties and problems that still exist  whenever a contractor has walked away from a project and left it in a state of  disrepair, which the public purse is then supposed to correct.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.30 am</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank Mr Craig for his question. In my view, there  are times when, in order to move good public bodies to a far better place  following difficult times, you need to have quite significant oversight  structures and, as Mr Bradley said, quite a hands-on approach to get a grip on  things.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I accept that the structure that we are creating of  ministerial, permanent secretary and wider oversight of the Housing Executive  is substantial. However, that is absolutely necessary. My experience over  recent months has been that there are times when you have to manage what is  going on in arm&rsquo;s-length and public bodies more actively and robustly. That is  the difference between Ministers being in government and being in power. There  were examples in the recent past of Ministers certainly being in government but  certainly not in power.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member knows that, if he brings a particular case to my  attention, I try to look at it. That applies to all Members. In fact, it is in  particular cases that you can begin to identify deeper issues or problems. So,  if the Member is referring to a particular case when people walked away from  their responsibilities, I would like to hear about it. Given the unprecedented  weather over the past four or five weeks, the burdens and responsibilities that  fell to the Housing Executive and its contractors and the experiences of too  many tenants, I would be keen to hear of particular cases. Through particular  cases I and others have identified wider weaknesses in the Housing Executive  response. So, if the Member is referring to a particular case, I would like to  hear about it so that we can reply in the particular as well as draw any wider  conclusions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to the situation that we had in the autumn with  political and wider comment, internal and external investigations and police  involvement in one or two matters and given some of the headlines, it seemed to  me that we needed to move quickly and decisively. That may not be a process  that brings everybody with you, but it is necessary to ensure that all that  should be done is getting done, and done in good time.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I came to the Assembly about this matter. I have come back  to the Assembly, and I said that I would go back to Committee about the  implementation plan when it is ready. I do not think that that will be the end  of the conversation in the Chamber or in the Committee. If that has to develop  and escalate further, I would welcome that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I note what the Member is saying about tenants. I will look  at that to see whether as a consequence of this work there is at least a wider  notification, consultation or circulation of information and conclusions that  can go to representative bodies, tenants&rsquo; groups and other organisations for  them to realise that this is a work in progress. Indeed, we welcome any  observations or comments that they have.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s thorough statement and congratulate him on it. Here is  one Minister who does not ignore or avoid problems and does not sleepwalk  through his ministry.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Given the findings of those reports, particularly about  procurement, can any general lesson be learned for the public sector? Those are  pertinent to the way that procurement is carried out across the public sector.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank the Member for his observation that I do not  sleepwalk through the Ministry. There were one or two occasions when I went  into the Lighthouse   Building after my  children were up overnight, as Simon Hamilton would appreciate, when I wondered  whether I was sleepwalking into the ministry.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My intuition tells me that there are general lessons to be  learned from this. I encourage Members to spend a little time reading the  reports, because there will probably be a need for a sea change in how  government generally tenders, completes and appoints contractors. There is a  need for a sea change.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At meetings of the Executive subgroup on the Budget, I  raised questions and asked for a discussion &mdash; it has been agreed that we will  have one &mdash; of how procurement in Northern Ireland works. In too many  instances, procurement in Northern Ireland is process-driven and, in contrast  to procurement in the European Community, does not acknowledge the need for  sustainability in the appointment of tenders, which, when translated to a  Northern Ireland context, would mean protection for small and medium-sized  enterprises.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a need for a sea change in procurement. We should  have competition, but we should also have legitimate mechanisms that protect  indigenous suppliers and contractors, including the third sector and small and  medium-sized enterprises. That is a broader point, over and above the gateway  review of the Egan contracts.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am writing to the Minister of Finance and Personnel on  the issue and will enclose a copy of the report. The permanent secretary has  brought the report to the attention of his colleagues in other Departments.  There will be wider implications for any other Department that uses an  Egan-type approach. My understanding is that, in the Department for Regional  Development and the Department of Education, there is an Egan-type approach,  subject to correction, as you can imagine would be required for Departments  that deal with the maintenance of schools, roads etc. If there is any learning  that can apply to those Departments or to any other Departments that have  adopted that approach, it should be applied urgently. That also applies to  Departments that have used Egan contracts or any of the other variations in  contracts that need more rigour built into their terms and conditions.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Maskey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Will the Minister explain why it has  taken so long to report on one of the contractual arrangements involving the  Housing Executive, namely the west Belfast  maintenance contract? I have been asking him and his predecessor questions on  that issue since March 2009. I also raised it with the Audit Office prior to  that, because I thought that that was the proper procedure that all Members  were supposed to follow. I have been asking questions about that ever since. To  wait almost two years for this report is too long. The Minister has let down  the people of west Belfast and the west Belfast district office  of the Housing Executive. What is the Minister trying to hide? Is it the lack  of leadership that he and his predecessor have shown on the issue? Or, is there  something more sinister involved, such as a conflict of interest between senior  Red Sky officials and senior Housing Executive officials? When will we be able  to see the outcome of the report&rsquo;s findings? I have been asking questions on  the issue since 2009.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I ask the Member to come to his question.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Maskey</strong>:  When I asked Margaret Ritchie about the Red Sky contract, she said that she was  unable to provide an answer because it was an operational matter for the  management of the Housing Executive. That proves that I have been asking  questions on the issue since 2009, contrary to what the Minister said.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I note the press release that has just been read out to  the Assembly.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Maskey</strong>:  I was asking questions.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I note the press release. The Member said that I am  letting down the people of west Belfast,  but that is not what the &lsquo;Andersonstown News&rsquo; says.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Maskey</strong>:  That is what I say.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I know that that is what you say, and we can all draw  conclusions about why you say that. That is not what the &lsquo;Andersonstown News&rsquo;  says. The &lsquo;Andersonstown News&rsquo; says that I have got the balance right.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I encourage Members to make their comments through the Chair.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: It says that I have the balance right between taking  initiatives that count for local people and being strategic. People will  probably understand that the &lsquo;Andersonstown News&rsquo; is not necessarily closely  linked to the SDLP. It is a very fine newspaper, and it is one of the best  community newspapers on these islands. The voice of the &lsquo;Andersonstown News&rsquo; is  not consistent with the voice of Paul Maskey, and people can draw their own  conclusions about who is letting people down as a consequence.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">People need to be very, very careful when talking about  such cases. The Member will know that criminal investigation and proper inquiry  must not be compromised.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Maskey</strong>:  I have been asking since 2009.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: As the Member is well aware, there have been a lot of  cases in Northern Ireland  since 2009. If we are to be exhaustive, follow due process and be seen to be  independent and impartial, it takes some time to investigate such cases.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  You said that &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. The Member must allow the Minister to continue.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I will deal with all Fra&rsquo;s points. People must be  careful that an ongoing inquiry, such as the Member referred to, or any other  criminal or internal investigation is not compromised. That is why the  suggestion that people are trying to hide something is inconsistent with the  facts and the ongoing process. It is simply headline grabbing for political  purposes, without responsibility to bear down on the issues to get to the truth  or to draw conclusions from the evidence.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There have been occasional passing comments from Mr Maskey  and his colleagues about a lack of leadership. However, those do not amount to  a thorough response to what Mr Maskey&rsquo;s colleague called a systemic failure.  Such comments are a slapdash, casual and superficial approach, not a serious  attempt to deal with the issue. If there was systemic failure, Members should  be shouting from the hills and demanding special meetings of the Committee for  Social Development, yet they have failed to do so. Those Members should not try  to cover their tracks belatedly because of their failure to deal with the issue  as they now claim it should have been dealt with. They should not portray  anyone as demonstrating a lack of leadership, especially not Margaret Ritchie.  The ongoing investigations stem from her input and concerns.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I said, a report on one issue was concluded some weeks  ago, and the contractor concerned has until the end of the month to reply to  it. Each and every time an issue arises about the Housing Executive, action is  taken to ensure that anything that needs to be investigated is investigated and  the truth prevails. That was also mentioned in the governance report. I have  made it clear to the board, the chief executive and the chairperson of the  Housing Executive that, if the evidence leads to certain conclusions about  individuals inside or outside the Housing Executive, whether now or in the  past, so be it. People will have to live with the consequences of where the  evidence leads.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Campbell</strong>:  I apologise to the Minister for missing the first part of his statement due to  unforeseen circumstances. In his statement, the Minister twice referred to the  wider governance review and the imbalance in the workforce of the Housing  Executive. The Minister will be aware that opportunities for employment in the  housing sector were central to some of the early problems of the Troubles 40  years ago. Then we had no monitoring of the workforce, Equality Commission or  rigid and robust guidelines to ensure that employers offered equal employment  opportunities. We now have all those things, yet the Housing Executive has  reported a year-on-year under-representation of the Protestant community in its  workforce for the past 12 years. Will the Minister ensure that the wider review  addresses that issue and does something about it?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I welcome the Member&rsquo;s question and the implication of  what he said. Having rigid guidelines, an Equality Commission, equality and  equality enforcement architecture in Northern Ireland has helped to move  us to a situation whereby, although there is not a balance in all workplaces,  there is more balance across most workplaces. I welcome what appears to be a  belated endorsement of the argument made by many over the past 30 or 40 years  that we needed equality law, architecture and enforcement to create a better  situation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">This was a no-holds-barred process, and the gateway review  and governance audit teams were explicitly and clearly instructed to say what  needed to be said. It would have been easy for me, Mr Campbell, to get someone  to whisper in someone else&rsquo;s ear and advise them not to get involved in certain  issues. The people involved in the review were given a clear mandate to comment  on any issues of governance, audit and contractual performance that they deemed  necessary. We are in a better place. Consequently, they acknowledged, as have  Mr Campbell and I and as the House has debated before, that there is an  imbalance in the workforce. Consistent with best equality law and the rigid  guidelines to which Mr Campbell referred, the Housing Executive has in place  the means and tools to address the equality issue. That is work in progress,  and I hope that it will improve the overall balance. I trust that Mr Campbell  will support tackling the much wider issues of imbalance, especially in the  senior ranks of the Civil Service and in other public organisations and  Departments.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.45 am</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We also have to deal with other imbalances. If the Housing  Executive is to mature in the next phase of its life, it needs to have the  internal capacity and personnel to develop and lead the organisation. An  emerging problem in the Housing Executive &mdash; it could exist in a range of other  organisations &mdash; is that the age profile means that a lot of people of senior  rank could move into retirement in the near future or medium term, leaving a  capacity and leadership gap. There needs to be succession planning to ensure  that the Housing Executive&rsquo;s great work over the past 40 years can be taken  forward by its leadership and by individuals over the next 20 years.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. The governance report mentions a range of  overspend from as little as &pound;34 to approximately &pound;600,000. Obviously, that is a  wide spectrum. Will the Minister give us details of the numbers in between and  what those amounts might total?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank the Member for his question, and I thank all  Members who have taken part in the debate. My sense of the discussion and  questions so far is of an acknowledgement that the review has been an  exhaustive and critical piece of work in moving the Housing Executive to a  different place. I acknowledge that the sense that comes from all Members&rsquo;  questions is that the review was a worthwhile exercise and that, subject to  full and faithful implementation, the Housing Executive and the housing sector  will be in a better place.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also want to acknowledge that the people at senior  management and senior board level in the Housing Executive are absolutely  committed to the process. When I met the chief executive of the Housing  Executive before Christmas, he had, at that stage, drafted an interim  implementation plan. Senior people in the organisation know that the measure of  them and of their leadership is the implementation of all the recommendations.  I am satisfied that they are applying themselves diligently to that task and  will do so over the next four weeks.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I meant to say in my opening statement that because the  review is so extensive, I am not fully on top of some issues. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span> I hold my hands up to Mr McCann. I will  come back to the Member on particular matters that may arise. Overspend is  clearly a matter that the Housing Executive board will have to address in the  implementation plan. It will have to answer to me when it draws its  conclusions.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  The Minister&rsquo;s statement is very lengthy. It is just a pity that we did not  receive as lengthy a statement outlining the catastrophic failings of the  Housing Executive over the Christmas period, when it walked away and left some  tenants to fend for themselves. The Minister&rsquo;s statement may be lengthy, but I  suspect that, when analysed, it does not say a lot. Will the Minister assure us  today that, as a result of his statement and the latest inquiry that he  initiated, the massive expenditure by the Housing Executive will stop? He sent  me an answer informing me that the Housing Executive and the Department for  Social Development have spent something like &pound;500,000 over the past three years  on conferences. Does he feel that that is the best way to spend money? Would it  not be much better spent on front line housing services?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank Lord Morrow for his questions. Throughout the  past four weeks, I have said that the Housing Executive&rsquo;s response was not what  it should have been during the initial phase of the unprecedented weather  conditions. Unlike other Ministers, before Christmas, I rolled up my arms and  tried to get a grip of the situation.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Maskey</strong>:  Arms or sleeves?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I am sorry: I rolled up my sleeves. I am a man of many  skills.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I did that to ensure that the circumstances that might be  developing in the run-up to Christmas were alleviated. I do not think that  other Ministers did the same. Before Christmas, I tried to prevail upon London to release  additional moneys to help people in need. I wrote to OFMDFM and asked for an  emergency Executive meeting to help manage the situation. All of that would  have added to the corporate response and the departmental responses to the  situations that arose. I think that I was interventionist when it came to  trying to manage the Christmas period, but I acknowledge that, even though I  laid down requirements for the Housing Executive in respect of the response to  the cold weather, the response was not all that it should have been in the  initial phase. I said so publicly at the time, and I have said so repeatedly. I  have come to Members. I went to the Social Development Committee last week to  outline a number of matters and was fully prepared to speak at length in  respect of the Housing Executive and housing associations&rsquo; response to the cold  weather. I welcome the opportunity to come back to the Committee next Thursday  in that regard. To show respect to the Committee, a written statement will be  released to all Members at the same time as I meet the Social Development  Committee about the winter response.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The point is that there were issues in the initial phase which  should not have arisen. Questions have to be asked of the Housing Executive  board and, in my view, questions can properly be raised at other levels as  well. However, during the subsequent phases, the Housing Executive and the  housing associations, where the problem was much less acute because of the  recent character of the stock, addressed issues more substantially. I  acknowledge the members of the Housing Executive staff and the contractors who  stretched themselves over a difficult period to deal with tenants&rsquo; needs. Yes,  there were times when tenants could have expected more. I do not walk away from  that. However, the full narrative of that period shows that this organisation  measured up to its task despite the earlier period, whereas, clearly, other organisations  did not.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I completely and utterly agree with the Member&rsquo;s last  point. My permanent secretary and senior officials will confirm that I have  interrogated DSD, the Social Security Agency, the child maintenance division,  the Housing Executive and everyone in between about expenditure on conferences,  travel and accommodation. It is extravagant and unacceptable. I have told them  to reduce it, and it is being reduced. I sent out a further directive in my  Department about two weeks ago to reduce spending on conferences and associated  costs even further. I completely agree with the Member in that regard.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire as an  r&aacute;iteas a thug s&eacute; d&uacute;inn inniu agus gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis fosta as an bhealach  fheidhmi&uacute;il a ndeachaigh s&eacute; i mbun na tuairisc&iacute; seo a thabhairt chun tosaigh.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I commend the Minister for his proactive approach in  commissioning the reports, which, presumably, will inform the wider fundamental  review of the Housing Executive. Will he give an update on that review? How  will those two reports feed into the wider review?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Time is almost up. I must ask the Minister to make a quick response.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I appreciate that advice, Mr Speaker. The fundamental  review is ongoing, as I have indicated, and an interim report will be available  in March. It will be a no-holds-barred report. I have told the consultants that  they need to come forward with any and all options, be they conservative or radical,  when it comes to the future character of the Housing Executive. I believe that  there will be a Housing Executive going forward; I am committed to a Housing  Executive going forward. Its shape and configuration might be somewhat  different, but that is subject to the evidence gathered and the outcome of the  fundamental review.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  That ends questions on the ministerial statement. I ask the House to take its  ease as we move to the Consideration Stage of the Local Government Finance  Bill.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Maskey</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. I know that the Minister did not mention any  names when he said that individual Members were not doing their work by reading  the draft report. If he looks at his own office and the questions that I have  posed to it in recent years on a particular contract in West   Belfast, it is clear that work was not done.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. That is not a point of order, although the Member has certainly got his  remark on the record.</p>

    <p class="Q3Motion">Moved. &mdash; [The Minister of the Environment (Mr Poots).]</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Members will have a copy of the Marshalled List of amendments detailing the  order for consideration. The amendments have been grouped for debate in my  provisional grouping of amendments selected list.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are two groups of amendments, and we will debate the  amendments in each group in turn. The first debate will be on amendment Nos 1  and 2 and amendment Nos 4 to 13, which deal with delegated powers in the Bill  and some technical changes. The second debate will be on amendment No 3, which  aims to prevent the Department from reducing mid-year the amount of rates  support grant awarded to a council.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Once the debate on each group is completed, any further  amendments in the group will be moved formally as we go through the Bill, and  the Question on each will be put without further debate. The Questions on stand  part will be taken at the appropriate points in the Bill. If that is clear, we  shall proceed.</p>

    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: A number of these amendments arise from recomm&shy;endations  that the Environment Committee made at Committee Stage. I thank Committee  members for their helpful recommendations and their timely scrutiny of the  Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">All the amendments in the group are technical in nature.  Amendment Nos 1 and 2 concern the level of Assembly control stipulated in  relation to one of the delegated powers in the Bill. Clause 24 makes provision  for security for money borrowed by a council and for the appointment by the  High Court of a receiver in the event of a default. Subsection (8) provides  that an application to appoint a receiver may not be made unless the amount  owed is &pound;10,000 or more. As it stands, subsection (9) enables my Department to  change that amount by means of an Order, subject to negative resolution. The  Committee, acting on advice from the Examiner of Statutory Rules, has  recommended that such an Order be subject to the affirmative procedure.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">12.00 noon</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The reason for that is that an Order under clause 24(9)  would bring about a direct amendment of the Bill in respect of a jurisdiction  of the High Court and should, therefore, attract a higher level of Assembly  scrutiny than the negative resolution procedure currently provided for. I agree  with the Environment Committee&rsquo;s recommendation. Amendment No 1 will remove  from subsection (9) the words that state that an Order for that purpose should  be subject to negative resolution. Amendment No 2 will provide for such an  Order to be subject to draft affirmative procedure. Those two amendments need  to be considered in tandem, and I urge Members to support them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 4 is linked to amendment No 6 as they are both  concerned with the means of collecting information from councils for the  calculation of the rates support grant. Clause 27 makes provision for the rates  support grant by bringing forward the existing provision for the resources  element of the general grant for the local government miscellaneous provisions.  As in the 2002 Order, clause 27(5) gives my Department the power to make  regulations, subject to draft affirmative procedure, on how the grant is to be  calculated. The current regulations for the general grant, which were made  under the 2002 Order, include a pro forma of the information that councils need  to provide for the grant calculation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The purposes of amendment Nos 4 and 6 is to allow the means  of requesting information used in the calculation of this grant to be sought by  departmental determination rather than by means of a pro forma stipulated in  regulations. That will allow technical updates to accounting practices that do  not affect the calculation of the grant to be taken forward promptly via  departmental determination and rather than through the draft affirmative  subordinate legislative route. I had emphasised that the formula and  calculation of the rates support grant will not be influenced by the amendment.  Its purpose is to enable my Department to reflect any technical updates to  accounting practices in a timelier manner and to avoid unnecessary draft  affirmative legislation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 6 will add a new subsection, shown in the Marshalled  List as subsection (9A), to clause 27, which gives my Department power to seek  this information from councils via determination. As a consequence, amendment  No 4 to subsection (5C) is needed to remove my Department&rsquo;s ability to regulate  in the matter. I urge Members to support those amendments.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 5 is a technical amendment that is linked to  amendment No 12. With your permission, Mr Speaker, I will give the background  to both of those amendments simultaneously. It is customary to provide that  subordinate legislation made under any of the enabling powers in a Bill may  contain any incidental, supplementary, consequential, transitory or saving  provisions. Currently, the Bill only makes that provision regarding regulations  under clause 27 in respect of the rates support grant. I recommend that it  should extend to all regulations or Orders made under the powers in the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 5 to clause 27 is technical and does not  change the provision that the rates support grant regulations may include such  incidental, supplementary, consequential, transitory or saving provision as  considered expedient or necessary. Instead, it simply moves the provision to  clause 43, where it will apply to all regulations and Orders made under the  powers in the Bill. The amendment to clause 43 is tabled as amendment No 12.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment Nos 7 to 11 were recommended by the Environment  Committee in the interests of gender-neutral drafting. Those amendments are  technical in nature and do not involve any change of policy. Part 3 of the  Local Government Finance Bill updates the legislative framework concerning  payments to councillors, the greater part of which currently sits in Part V of  the Local Government Act (Northern    Ireland) 1972.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 32 provides for the payment of allowances to the  chairman and, where applicable, vice-chairman of the council. The terms  &ldquo;chairman&rdquo; and &ldquo;vice-chairman&rdquo; were used in clause 32 as they refer to the  offices established under sections 11 and 13 of the Local Government Act (Northern Ireland)  1972. The terms were preserved in the Bill, as introduced, in order to maintain  a connection with the 1972 Act. During Committee Stage, the Environment  Committee noted the use of the terms in clause 32 and recommended that the Bill  should be amended to replace them with gender-neutral terms. That proposal will  not change the provision permitting a council to pay allowances to its chair or  vice-chair. As the Assembly is committed to the use of gender-neutral language  in the drafting of legislation, I accept the Environment Committee&rsquo;s  recommendation. I have tabled amendment Nos 7 to 9 accordingly to amend all the  references in clause 32 to &ldquo;chairman&rdquo; and &ldquo;vice-chairman&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment Nos 10 and 11 also relate to gender-neutral  drafting. Clause 39 provides for payments regarding public appeals and  re-enacts without amendment the current provision of section 115(1A) of the  Local Government Act (Northern    Ireland) 1972. Amendment Nos 10 and 11 will  replace the references to &ldquo;chairman&rdquo; in clause 39 with &ldquo;chairperson&rdquo; for the  purposes of gender-neutral drafting and will not impact on a council&rsquo;s powers  to make payments in connection with public appeals. I urge Members to accept  amendment Nos 7 to 11 so that the Bill may achieve consistency.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I already explained the background to amendment No 12 in my  introduction of amendment No 5. However, I will summarise by reminding Members  that amendment No 12 is technical and does not affect the level of Assembly  scrutiny or any regulations or Orders made under the powers in the Bill. It is  simply a general provision that any regulations or Orders made under the Bill  may include such incidental, supplementary, consequential, transitory or saving  provisions as considered expedient or necessary.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The last amendment in this group, amendment No 13, is the  addition of the Deregulation and Contracting Out (Northern Ireland) Order 1996 to the  schedule of minor and consequential amendments. It will ensure that the  definition of the term &ldquo;chief financial officer&rdquo; in that Order will refer to  the Local Government Finance Act (Northern Ireland) 2011. That will  not impact on policy; it is merely a matter of updating a legislative  reference. I ask all Members to support these amendments.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for the Environment (Mr Boylan)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a  Cheann Comhairle. Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Ar son an Choiste Comhshaoil,  ba mhaith liom f&aacute;ilte a chur roimh an Bhille um maoini&uacute; rialtais &aacute;iti&uacute;il.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On behalf of the Environment Committee, I welcome the  Consideration Stage of the Local Government Finance Bill. The Bill may not seem  particularly important or relevant to the ordinary person on the street.  However, having gone through a detailed scrutiny of it, I can say with  confidence that the Bill has the potential to impact on every citizen in the  North, because it gives local authorities more powers to handle their finances.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The main aim of the Bill is to modernise the current  legislative framework for local government finance and councillors&rsquo;  remuneration. It will allow district councils to have greater freedom to manage  their financial affairs without having to obtain consent from the Department.  However, that, of course, is a double-edged sword, and with more powers must  come more responsibility.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The robustness of the audit process exercised the Committee  on several occasions during Committee Stage. Before I go into detail on the  amendments, I will bring your attention, a LeasCheann Comhairle, to the  Committee&rsquo;s recommendation that, in conjunction with the implementation of the Bill,  the audit process should be reviewed and, if necessary, strengthened. We would  welcome a commitment from the Minister today that that will take place.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill was referred to the Committee on 28 April 2010,  and, to ensure that there was enough time to scrutinise the Bill fully and  effectively, the Committee sought an extension to December 2010. Even with the  officials&rsquo; constructive approach and the good working relationship between the  Department and the Committee, it took us almost all that time to scrutinise the  Bill in depth. The Committee&rsquo;s detailed scrutiny led to five recommendations,  and I am pleased to report that the Minister has taken on board all except one  of the Committee&rsquo;s recommendations for amendments. I thank the Minister for  listening to the Committee and for taking those recommendations on board.  However, I urge him to reconsider the reconsider the Committee&rsquo;s amendment,  which I will explain in detail in the debate on the next group of amendments.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Before I talk about the amendments in detail, I wish to  mention a very significant issue that is relevant to the Bill. The Committee is  keen to see the inclusion of social clauses in public procurement contracts,  and it questioned the Department about including the necessary legislation in the  Bill. However, the Committee was delighted to learn that the restrictions to  social clauses are being dealt with through subordinate legislation and that  work on that is already under way. The Committee urges the Department to  progress that rapidly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will now comment on the first group of amendments. The 12  amendments in this group have all been tabled by the Minister. However, as I  mentioned, the Committee several of those amendments were recommended to  improve the Bill. First, the Committee wanted to see the level of Assembly  scrutiny raised to the highest level should the Department choose to exercise  its powers to substitute a different sum of money for the amount at which a  receiver may be appointed. The amount is currently set at &pound;10,000, but the Bill  gives the Department power to alter that. The Committee felt that, because it  would directly amend the Bill in respect of the jurisdiction of the High Court,  it was important that a decision to change it should come before the Assembly  to be affirmed. Amendment Nos 1 and 2 make the necessary changes, and, on  behalf of the Committee, I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s amendments to clause 24  accordingly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will now skip to amendment Nos 7 to 11, which have been  tabled by the Department on the Committee&rsquo;s recommendation. Mindful of the  Executive&rsquo;s commitment to draft their legislation in gender-neutral terms, the  Committee was concerned to see reference to &ldquo;chairman&rdquo; and &ldquo;vice-chairman&rdquo; in  the Bill. Although members recognise the validity of the Department&rsquo;s rationale  that this is in keeping with local government legislation, it called on the  Department to make the necessary changes to bring the legislation into the  twenty-first century. On behalf of the Committee, I therefore welcome these  five amendments that achieve that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment Nos 4 and 6 were brought during Committee Stage  of the Bill, and the Department explained that they will allow the information  it requires to calculate the rates support grant by determination rather than  pro forma. Officials assured the Committee that this would not affect the  formula, the calculation of the rates support grant or the elements to be taken  into account of in the calculation, but they would allow the Department  sufficient flexibility to adjust the new accounting practices without having to  bring subordinate legislation to the Assembly for approval each time. On the  basis of that assurance, the Committee accepted the amendments. On behalf of  the Committee, I support amendment Nos 4 and 6.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I turn to amendment Nos 5 and 13, as one is consequential  to the other. The Committee was advised of these amendments during Committee  Stage and accepted that they were to allow for the addition of a further  Statutory Instrument to schedule 1. I support amendment Nos 5 and 13 on behalf  of the Committee accordingly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 12 was also brought by the Department during  Committee Stage, and the Committee accepted the Department&rsquo;s explanation for  its inclusion. The Committee understands that it is common practice for primary  legislation to contain a provision to allow orders and regulations to be made  in order to include such incidental, supplementary, consequential, transitory  or saving provisions as may be required. However, in the Bill as drafted, that  only applied to a single clause. The amendment broadens that to apply it to the  entire Bill. Therefore, on behalf of the Committee, I also accept amendment No  12. That concludes the Committees&rsquo; position on the amendments in group 1.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  I am also pleased to speak at this Consideration Stage, especially as the  Bill&rsquo;s intent is to make life easier for councils in managing their finances. I  will be very brief. My biggest concern with these eases is around asking for  extra or stronger auditing of councils. There will have to be some hand-holding  of councils, which all interpret things in different ways at the moment, to  ensure that they fully understand how to make the most of this new freedom and  of the controls and the risk element that comes with it. I do not want the  Department to be seen to be heavy handed or to be the regulator or the  punisher, although it will have its position in the audit. We need very strong  guidance to help councils make the most of these new regulations.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I fully support amendment Nos 1 and 2, which require draft affirmative  resolution to be brought if we wish to change the figure of &pound;10,000 above which  a receiver should be involved. Amendments Nos 4 and 6 are technical amendments,  which relate to the rates support grant and its determination. It is good that  the Department says that it will talk to councils and will have the power,  through this Bill, to determine the grant. However, the report states that  in-year cuts in the rates support grant or the resources grant were unique or  exceptional, yet we know that, in the Budget this year, there will be a  reduction of &pound;1&middot;2 million in the resources grant. Those grants are incredibly  important to the councils. Therefore, I ask the Minister and Department to make  sure that councils know of those matters well in advance.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We fully agree with amendment Nos 7 to 11, which deal with  gender-neutral drafting. We also fully support amendment Nos 5, 12 and 13,  which are technical.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I call Dr Stephen Farry.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  Thank you very much, Mr Deputy Speaker &mdash; I am sorry; Mr Speaker. I demoted you  there by accident. I declare an interest as a member of North Down Borough  Council. We regard the amendments in this group as being largely technical,  although we obviously strongly welcome the gender-neutral language and wonder  why it was written any other way in the first place. We give our full support  to the amendments in this group, and there is probably little more to be said  at this stage. We will have more to say about the second group of amendments.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr W Clarke</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I declare an interest as a member of  Down District Council. Sinn F&eacute;in supports the first group of amendments.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The main aim of the Bill is to allow councils greater  flexibility to manage their financial affairs without having to go continually  to the Department, which is time-consuming for the Department and councils.  Having to do that brings a great deal of uncertainty to the rolling out of  council plans. With that responsibility comes a greater scrutiny role, which the  Chairperson mentioned. Greater audit powers may be required, and, as Danny  Kinahan said, we need strong guidance for councils in that regard.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I joined the Committee for the Environment relatively late  in the Bill&rsquo;s Committee Stage, so most of the Committee work had already been  carried out &mdash; luckily enough, says the Chairperson. One of the main issues that  I raised came about when a NILGA delegation gave a presentation: social clauses  regarding procurement by council. When councils carry out major procurement for  the likes of leisure centres, headquarters and stuff like that, meaningful  apprenticeships and job opportunities should be given to the long-term  unemployed from the area. I am glad to hear that the subordinate legislation  will deal with that, and I look forward to it coming through the Committee.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, amendment Nos 7 to 11 deal with the gender-neutral  terms in the legislation. That has to be welcomed, because the titles  &ldquo;chairman&rdquo; and &ldquo;vice-chairman&rdquo; are not appropriate in this day and age in  relation to equality for our female colleagues who are councillors, MLAs or  whatever. If women are to be encouraged into politics, a neutral atmosphere  needs to be provided. When I became my council&rsquo;s chairman, I wanted to be known  as the chairperson. That caused a great deal of difficulty, which was all down  to dinosaur local government legislation. As I say, we need to promote a good  neutral environment for women in council chambers. Sinn F&eacute;in supports the  amendments.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I thank Members for the issues that they raised during the  debate. I will cover them quite quickly. The issue of audit is always available  for review. Audit procedures need to be effective, efficient and understandable  so that councils know exactly where they stand, what they are permitted to do  and so forth. On some occasions, there has been a degree of confusion, which  has not always led to best practice. Sometimes, there have been attempts to  resolve issues in a very ham-fisted way, so audit procedures need to be  reviewed constantly. Should matters arise, we would be quite happy to look at  those issues.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We are finalising the consultation document on the social  clauses introduced by the subordinate legislation, and it will be issued in the  near future. I am very keen that local authorities are able, as far as  possible, to use local businesses, so long as they provide and demonstrate  value for money. However, sometimes, only very small savings &mdash; a few pence or a  few pounds &mdash; can be achieved in the process. Ultimately, that leads to the loss  of local jobs, which does not benefit local communities, so we will look at all  that to see whether we can move the issue forward.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My officials have been working on supporting councils in  the early stages of the new financial regime, and we will continue to work with  our local government counterparts to ensure that councils are assisted, and,  where necessary, we will offer further assistance with the introduction of the  new financial regime. So, we are very happy to address the matter raised by Mr  Kinahan, and I thank Members for their support for the amendments thus far.</p>

    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><span class="Italic">Clause 27 (Rates support grant)</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  We now come to the second group of amendments for debate. There is only one  amendment &mdash; amendment No 3 &mdash; which aims to prevent the Department from reducing  mid-year the amount of rates support grant awarded to a council.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for the Environment</strong>: I beg to move amendment No 3: In page  9, line 26, at end insert</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;and shall not be reduced during the financial year in  question&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I shall explain the Committee&rsquo;s reasons for tabling  amendment No 3. On 23 July 2010, during Committee Stage, the Department  announced that the rates support grant was to be cut. For those more familiar  with the old terminology, that refers to the resource element of the general  grant. The Minister was at pains to stress that it was not a common occurrence  and that it was not something that he took lightly. Nonetheless, 18 councils in  receipt of a rates support grant received an in-year cut of 5&middot;9%. The impact on  councils varied, but, in total, it amounted to &pound;1&middot;1 million being taken out of  the local government economy overnight. Not all councils receive the rates  support grant, which is calculated using a formula in order to support councils  whose wealth per capita falls below the national average. Consequently, only  councils that are already under financial pressure receive it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The problem does not lie in the formula. Indeed, based on  submissions to the Committee, it would be fair to say that councils are  generally happy with the present statutory formula under current local  government arrangements. The problem lies with the fact that the grant can be  cut during the financial year. As anyone here who has been a councillor knows  fine well, an in-year reduction in funds is very difficult for a council to  manage. Once a council has struck its rate for the year, it cannot go back to  its citizens to ask for more until the following year. This was a clear case of  the Department changing the goalposts mid-game, which the Committee believed  was not acceptable or fair. Members certainly recognised that the Department&rsquo;s  budget was under pressure at the time, but the in-year monitoring-round process  gives more flexibility than councils have.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee was informed that the Minister told councils  recently that, due to the severe financial challenges facing his Department, he  cannot rule out further in-year cuts in future years. That could lead to some  councils that are in receipt of the highest support grants losing millions of  pounds, result in rates going up by as much as 25% and put ratepayers in those  districts at a distinct disadvantage. The Committee, therefore, felt that the  opportunity should be taken to prevent such a decision being taken again.  Members fully acknowledged that the Department has to cut its cloth accordingly  and, indeed, acknowledged the necessity for that in its recent scrutiny of the  budget proposals. However, that should be done at the start of the year,  allowing councils to strike their rates accordingly. The amendment will mean  that once the rates support grant has been agreed, it will be ring-fenced, and  the councils will be able to budget in the certain knowledge that that will not  be altered during the year.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: At  the start, I should declare an interest as a member of North Down Borough  Council. However, other Members might have an even greater interest because,  directly speaking, the rates support grant does not financially aid north Down  in any way. One can draw conclusions on whether I have an interest in the  matter or not.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will oppose the amendment. However, I do not do so  without sympathy towards it. I and others have been in the position of looking  at finance and setting rates at council level, and, understandably, we do not  want a situation in which something is imported in the middle of the rates  process that could affect it. Consequently &mdash; I am sure that the Minister will  agree &mdash; we should, as far as possible, avoid any situation in which there is an  in-year cut; it is not something that would be embraced by the Minister of the  Environment or any other Minister, because it is not good practice.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, there is a distinction between what is broadly  good practice and what should be a legislative requirement. The problem with  the amendment is that it ring-fences that to prevent it ever happening from a  legislative point of view. That is not the case with any other part of the  Minister&rsquo;s budget or with pretty much any other Minister&rsquo;s budget. The  amendment would put us in a unique situation in which one aspect of the budget  could not be touched but any other aspect is open to be changed in-year. As we  have seen from experience, there can be circumstances whereby a financial  tsunami hits Northern    Ireland, and we could end up in a situation  in which we are overwhelmed by circumstances and in which action needs to be  taken quite swiftly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Perhaps a more likely situation is that we may yet get hit  by another, unannounced, cut from George Osborne that is simply imposed on the  Executive and through which &pound;100 million, &pound;200 million or &pound;300 million is  suddenly dragged back and taken out of the Budget. That has happened with the  emergency Budget, and it could happen again. Consequently, Ministers &mdash; the  Environment Minister no less than any other &mdash; may well be faced with having to  make in-year cuts in circumstances that would not be welcomed by the Minister  or, indeed, by any Minister. That would have to be faced up to and the  Minister, when deciding his budget, would have to look at all the aspects of  the Department and identify areas for cuts.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Are we saying that, if there are to be cuts, the support  for local government will be sacrosanct and, for example, the road safety  budget will not be ring-fenced but the resources grant cannot be cut by a  penny? Are we to say that environmental protection is to be completely open to  any degree of in-year monitoring or in-year cuts but we cannot touch local  government? Are we to say that the money for waste support and similar issues  can be taken away but we must legislate for and ring-fence this one aspect so  that it cannot come out of the budget? That, to my mind, is not a logical  position.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I said, any Minister will strive to avoid that  situation. However, some circumstances can be entirely outside a Minister&rsquo;s  control and can overtake events. Although I think that it is good practice to  not have in-year cuts, it is a step too far to legislate for that. That is why,  on reflection, I believe that the amendment is unwise and we are better to not  have such a rigid position but to give a little bit of flexibility to the  Department, the Minister and the Executive. It is not even the case that bits  of health spending or education spending are so ring-fenced that they cannot be  touched from a resource point of view, so it is beyond me why this is being put  in a unique position, which would be the case if the amendment went through.  Consequently, although I understand the sentiments behind the amendment and its  practical implications, it does not merit support, so I oppose it.</p>

    <p class="OralAnswers-H2DepartmentHeading">Justice</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Police Training   College</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">1. <strong>Mr  McGlone </strong>asked the Minister of Justice for an update on the new police  training college at Desertcreat, County   Tyrone.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 865/11)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice (Mr Ford)</strong>: Since becoming Minister, I have made a strong case for  the establishment of the joint public services college at Desertcreat.  Recognising its importance to the delivery of public services in Northern Ireland,  my colleagues in the Executive have joined with me in ensuring that the project  goes ahead. Therefore, all the capital funding required to construct the  training college has been provided in the Department of Justice&rsquo;s draft budget.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Subject to the Department of Finance and Personnel (DFP)  approving the business case, the design, completion and procurement  pre-qualification stage will take place between February 2011 and November  2011, and the detailed procurement process leading to the appointment of a contractor  will be completed by April 2012. The construction of the college will begin in  May 2012 and will be completed by June 2014.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat. I thank the Minister for his answer. It is welcome news  for the constituency. I am sure that other Members, not least you, a LeasCheann  Comhairle, will welcome that news. Can we have an assurance, in so far as an  absolute assurance can be given, that no further delay by any Department will  cause any aspect of the project to be held up and that it will happen within  the time constraints outlined by the Minister?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: The project is good not just for the constituency; it is extremely  good for Northern Ireland,  although there will be particular economic benefits for mid-Ulster.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In so far as I can give an assurance, given that the  Department of Justice&rsquo;s capital budget has now been allocated entirely, there  is still work to be done in respect of the Fire and Rescue Service, which is  not part of my Department but reports to the Department of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety (DHSSPS). We will seek to ensure that the timetable  that I have outlined is stuck to.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  Following the statement that all the funding was in place to get on with the  project, some of the Minister&rsquo;s colleagues tried to cast doubt on that funding.  Can the Minister assure the House that the total funding for the construction  of the Desertcreat police training college is now in place and that the project  is going ahead?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: I can confirm that the capital funding is entirely in place if the  draft Budget becomes the final agreed Budget. The issue that I suspect the  Member is hinting at is the exact amount available for recurrent expenditure in  connection with the running of the Fire and Rescue Service part of the college.  My officials continue to work with officials in DHSSPS on that issue, but my  understanding is that, in total, the extra funding, in resource terms, in the  Budget period for the first three years amounts to &pound;72,000, &pound;197,000 and  &pound;92,000. I hope that the Fire and Rescue Service will be able to meet that  commitment.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lyttle</strong>:  As a member of the Committee for Employment and Learning, I am particularly  concerned about how the House responds to the challenge of job creation and  training opportunities for the region. Will the project create apprenticeship  opportunities for the area?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: Under the social clauses requirement of the procurement toolkit,  there is an opportunity to stipulate the level of apprenticeships or even the  numbers of long-term unemployed people to be taken on by a contractor for a  particular contract. Although we cannot specify which businesses in the  locality might get the contract, most jobs are likely to be created from the  mid-Ulster area.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Some recent examples have shown a social clauses  requirement as high as one apprentice per &pound;2 million of capital spend, which  could be a significant boost for training young people in mid-Ulster for  employment. I am committed to make the best possible opportunity and to use it.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Prison Service: Governance</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">2. <strong>Mr  O&rsquo;Loan </strong>asked the Minister of Justice what action he intends to take to  address the problems identified in the recent report by the Criminal Justice  Inspection on corporate governance arrangements in the NI Prison Service. (AQO 866/11)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: I previously made it clear to the House that I recognise the  importance of the report, and I am grateful to Dr Maguire for helping to  crystallise the main difficulties and the scale of the challenge that lie ahead  for the Northern Ireland Prison Service (NIPS). However, the report&rsquo;s  conclusions came as no surprise, which is why I made Prison Service reform one  of my key commitments when I took up office. Work to that effect is already well  under way.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The independent review of prisons is expected to produce an  interim report in February 2011. The review team is considering the overall  operation of the service in order to map out the strategic direction that  change must take. I am satisfied that that work, and the outworkings of any  recommendations from the review, will need to bring fundamental transformation  to the Prison Service. Work is also under way to bring forward the Prison  Service&rsquo;s own strategic efficiency and effectiveness programme, which is also  one of my ministerial priorities. That programme will drive and deliver change  that will, ultimately, flow from the recommendations of the independent review.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Dr Maguire&rsquo;s report highlighted many areas for improvement  throughout the Northern Ireland Prison Service. New management will help to  bring a fresh perspective to how those might be tackled. I am aware that the  new director general has made it a key priority to work with governors to get  the basics right throughout the entire service. Change is already under way:  governance arrangements are being reviewed and improved; the new director  general has made senior management appointments to fill the governor-in-charge  posts at Maghaberry and Magilligan prisons; and a recent agreement with the  Prison Officers&rsquo; Association (POA) sets out how it and management can best work  together to overcome the challenges of the next few years and to deliver  significantly improved, more appropriate and effective regimes for prisoners.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Effective reform of the scale that is required will need  time, patience and resources. Crucially, it will need support from every side  of the House. The prize will be an effective, efficient, reliable and modern  Prison Service.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his answer. Given that a new director general of prisons  has just been appointed, what direction has the Minister given to that new  office holder in order to commence the absolutely rigorous reform agenda that  is so clearly necessary?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: I have not given direction to the new director general on  operational matters; it is up to him to manage prisons operationally. However,  I will certainly work with him and with other senior managers when we have seen  the outcome of the review by Dame Anne Owers, which we expect to receive in  February. I will work with the director general to ensure that the review&rsquo;s  recommendations are implemented.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Campbell</strong>:  Can the Minister assure the House and the public that whatever he does with  regard to Dr Maguire&rsquo;s report, recruitment to the Prison Service, whether at  the new Magilligan prison or at Maghaberry prison, will be carried out solely  on merit and that that will be the position from now on?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: We need to be careful when we talk about recruitment, especially  when it might be more a matter of downsizing the number of Prison Service  staff. However, the key principle of recruitment to the public service is,  surely, recruitment on merit. I have supported that principle throughout my  entire business life, and I will certainly continue to do so.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCartney</strong>:  Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire as na freagra&iacute; sin. Is the Minister satisfied  that, whatever the outcome of the Owers report and Dr Michael Maguire&rsquo;s  observations, his outline budget proposals will give him the necessary  resources to ensure that the Prison Service fulfils future need?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: I thank the Member for his question, which highlights the  challenge ahead of us. The challenging budget that is being set in accordance  with the draft Budget will give the Department the opportunity to deliver a  more efficient and effective model that does better work to rehabilitate  prisoners and for which costs are comparable to those of prison services in  adjacent jurisdictions. However, the Member is right to highlight the  challenge. That is why I mentioned the need to ensure that consensus is reached  in the House to implement necessary reforms.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Security: Funding</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">3. <strong>Mr  Givan </strong>asked the Minister of Justice what progress has been made in securing  the bid, from Treasury reserves, for policing security needs identified by the  Chief Constable. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 867/11)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: I have been working with the Chief Constable and the Secretary of  State to secure the additional security funding that is required by the PSNI.  Agreement on the devolution of justice to the Assembly recognised that access  to the reserve would be possible for exceptional security pressures. That is  the current situation. The Chief Constable has made a compelling case for  additional funding to help to keep the community safe and to bear down on those  responsible for terrorist attacks. I acknowledge the Secretary of State&rsquo;s  support for the bid. The additional requirement is for about &pound;245 million over  the four-year period. The Executive have agreed to provide additional funding  for justice of &pound;45 million over the four-year period, and I welcome that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have determined that all the extra resource should go  into the police budget to fund its work to tackle the security situation. The  amount being sought from the Treasury reserve is slightly less than &pound;200  million. That is in line with the amount of additional support required in  2010-11, which has amounted to &pound;50&middot;3 million. However, I want to stress that  the PSNI has been subjected to rigorous scrutiny and challenge in respect of  that bid and the use of resources more widely.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In respect of the main police grant, I have already made it  clear that I have sought to protect the PSNI budget in recognition of the  pressures that it faces, but all parts of the Department must make a  contribution. The PSNI has accepted that it can achieve efficiencies. The draft  Budget sets the PSNI the challenge of delivering &pound;135 million efficiencies over  the four years. I fully support the bid for additional resources that has been  made. I have made it clear that my ability to accept the draft Budget is  conditional on the additional security funding being received. I met the  Secretary of State yesterday, and I have impressed the urgency upon him. I  expect to hear the outcome shortly. I know that the case is being discussed at  the very highest levels of government.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Givan</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his response. It is of some concern that we have a draft  budget for the Department that is based upon getting an additional &pound;200  million-plus from the Treasury. It is, therefore, a concern that that has not  been rectified. Hopefully, the security situation will not deteriorate any  further. However, if we achieve the additional money for the next four years,  has an assurance been given that we will be able to go to the Treasury to  access yet further money from the reserves if the situation does deteriorate  and extra money is needed?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: My understanding of the agreement that was reached between the  First Minister and deputy First Minister and the previous Prime Minister is  clear. Access to the reserve is possible, if required, for security funding. We  have sought to ensure that the necessary funding, as currently perceived for  the four years, is in place, but I do not believe that that restricts us from  making a further application, should it be required.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  What management and accounting arrangements are in place for the additional  money? Will the Chief Constable have direct and convenient access to those  funds?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: The arrangement is exactly the same as that for all funds that are  awarded to the Police Service. They will be for the Chief Constable to manage  on the basis of the normal accounting arrangements that he operates under.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Will the Minister provide his  assessment of the current security situation? What would be the consequences  for that situation if the funding were not forthcoming?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: Mr Bradley puts me in a slightly difficult position, since I  suspect that I would probably annoy Mr Bell and Mr McNarry were I to go too far  down the first part of his question. I can, however, agree with him that there  would be extremely serious consequences if we did not get what is seen as the  minimum funding necessary to deal with the particular circumstances in which  the Police Service is operating. That is why I have been pressing hard and  having regular contact with the Secretary of State. He has assured me of the  discussions that he has been having with the Treasury and the Cabinet Office to  ensure that the point is made at the highest level in London.</p>

    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">4. <strong>Mr  McDevitt </strong>asked the Minister of Justice for his assessment of the need for  an independent statutorily based Prisoner Ombudsman.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 868/11)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: I believe that there is a need to have an independent office to  investigate prisoner complaints. In line with the reference in the Hillsborough  Castle Agreement of 5 February 2010, I am committed to placing the powers with  the Prisoner Ombudsman on a statutory footing. In the meantime, I am satisfied  that the Prisoner Ombudsman is carrying out her functions in an open,  transparent and effective manner, and I am confident that the officer&rsquo;s ability  to operate independently of the Department and the Northern Ireland Prison  Service is in no way compromised.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">With the devolution of justice, we have the opportunity to  develop local solutions that better suit the needs of Northern Ireland  and enable us to take account of the need to make the most efficient use of  scarce resources.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am seeking the views of the First Minister and deputy  First Minister on how any wider review of ombudsman services, including those  of the Assembly Ombudsman, might influence decisions on the future of the  Prisoner Ombudsman&rsquo;s office. I am also aware that the Committee for the Office  of the First Minister and deputy First Minister is consulting on updating  legislation to reform the Office of the Northern Ireland Ombudsman. I want to  take account of any relevant developments in that area before coming to any  final decision.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  Will the Minister elaborate on his reply and assure the House that when we talk  about an independent and statutorily based Prisoner Ombudsman, we mean just  that &mdash; not a subservient ombudsman of another ombudsman, but a separate,  independent, standalone ombudsman, capable of meeting the real challenges of  scrutiny within the prison estate and the Prison Service as it stands today?</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: I agree with the point that the Member is making, but he needs to  be careful not to suggest that there is any restriction on the independence of  the ombudsman at the moment. The reason why I said that we are reviewing the  operation of the ombudsman is that given the financial stringencies that we  live within, I believe that it is incumbent on every Department to look at  issues such as back office co-ordination and to ensure that matters are dealt  with in a way that makes most efficient use of limited amounts of public money.  On that basis, I am seeking the views of the First Minister and deputy First  Minister and their Committee to see what is the best way in which we can ensure  that we get value for money. However, there is a fundamental issue of ensuring  that there is full independence for the Prisoner Ombudsman&rsquo;s functions, and  that is something that I am absolutely committed to.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Given the answer that the Minister  gave to my colleague regarding the Prisoner Ombudsman, does he not agree that  the fact that corporate manslaughter has now been brought on to the statute  book almost strengthens the argument to give statutory powers to the Prisoner  Ombudsman?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: The simple answer is no; I am not sure that the issue of corporate  manslaughter actually makes a significant impact on the question of statutory  powers. The issue of statutory powers is part of the Hillsborough Castle  Agreement and is in need of addressing, in any event. The important thing is  that we do it in a way that ensures value for money. The arrangements are well  in hand. If there is a particular crossover when, during an investigation, the  ombudsman feels that it is appropriate to make a reference to the police, the  ombudsman will make that reference, should that also include something such as  corporate manslaughter. That is compliant with our obligations and is in place  in an appropriate way. However, the overall structure of the office clearly  needs to be looked at.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Domestic Violence: Access to Justice</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">5. <strong>Ms S  Ramsey </strong>asked the Minister of Justice what measures he has considered to  assist victims of domestic violence when accessing justice, following his  announcement of changes to legal aid for people applying for a non-molestation  order.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 869/11)</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">13. <strong>Mr  O&rsquo;Dowd </strong>asked the Minister of Justice what steps he intends to take to  ensure that people who have experienced physical abuse within a household, who  do not meet the criteria for legal aid and are lacking in financial means, have  access to justice.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 877/11)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: With your permission, Mr Deputy Speaker, I will answer questions 5  and 13 together. The Northern Ireland Legal Services Commission has  responsibility for administering legal aid in Northern Ireland. As part of its  programme of reform, it is considering the introduction of a change to the  legal aid financial eligibility rules for those suffering from domestic  violence. However, I have announced an interim action that will ensure that  those who are at risk of not being able to seek an order because of the  potential for having to pay will be supported in the work that they are doing.  That is why I announced, given the number of incidents that occur, an immediate  change to the legal aid function to provide that increased protection for  victims of domestic violence.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Prior to that announcement, those seeking legal aid to  apply for a non-molestation order had first to pass a fixed means test in order  to receive funding. Those with earnings above the statutory threshold would not  have been entitled to legal aid. I have now removed the upper earnings and  capital thresholds for anyone applying for those orders. That means that no one  should be refused legal aid to apply for a non-molestation order in the  Magistrate&rsquo;s Court because of their financial status.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A contribution towards legal costs will be required from  those who take advantage of that waiver, but it will be a fixed, one-off amount  linked to an individual&rsquo;s financial circumstances and payable subsequent to a  court case, rather than being required upfront, as has sometimes happened in  the past.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s  clarification on that, considering that the majority of people who apply for  non-molestation orders are women and suffer all forms of domestic violence and  abuse. I am just concerned that it will add to their suffering. I appreciate  the Minister&rsquo;s commitment to ensure that it does not necessarily depend on  financial arrangements. Is the Minister confirming that anybody who applies for  legal aid for a non-molestation order &mdash; either male or female &mdash; will not be  impeded because of their financial arrangements?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: No; the position is quite clear. Anyone who applies for legal aid  for a non-molestation order has the waiver of the upper limits, which means  that they are entitled to legal aid but will subsequently have to pay a  contribution based on their income and their assets. The key thing is that they  can get the legal aid for the non-molestation order immediately. In the past,  there have been reports of individual firms of solicitors seeking significant  cash payments in advance of assisting people with orders. That is what I have  sought to prevent by allowing this route into legal aid on a wider basis.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Ramsey</strong>:  I relate this question to a case that I was involved with in my constituency  recently. A young woman felt fear, worry and stress due to the fact that  someone who was charged with domestic violence was out on bail. Does the  Minister agree that special care should be taken to make sure that those  charged with domestic violence are released on bail on the strictest possible  terms to ensure the safety of the alleged victim?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: I am being encouraged to start to interfere in the rights of the  judiciary to set the terms for bail. I will resist that temptation. However, we  are all concerned to ensure that those who require protection, that is, those  who are victims of violence of any sort, are given the best protection  available. However, the precise details of any individual case have to be left  to the relevant judge.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his clarification on the legal aid issue. How much will  that cost, and what effect will it have on his budget?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: Legal aid is not designed to be something that will either add to  or reduce costs. Those who would perhaps not have been eligible for legal aid  in the past will receive it and pay an appropriate contribution for it. We are  looking at a potential cost to the Department of a few tens of thousands of  pounds per annum. I think that that is entirely justifiable in the context of  our seeking to protect vulnerable members of society.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Prison Service</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">6. <strong>Mr  Bresland </strong>asked the Minister of Justice what steps he intends to take to  increase public confidence in the Prison Service.&nbsp; (AQO 870/11)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: Members will be aware that the Prison Service has been at the  centre of a series of highly regrettable failings. Last month&rsquo;s report on the  governance arrangements highlighted that those failings were symptomatic of  deeper problems that can be addressed only through fundamental reform. I have  said previously that our prison system developed in response to the issues of  another day. However, although society and its expectations of NIPS have  changed, the service has not kept pace with those changes.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The challenge for me, as Minister, for the leadership in  the Prison Service and for the political leaders of this House is to deliver  the necessary reforms to turn the Prison Service into a modern, effective and  efficient service. That is why I made reform one of my key ministerial  priorities, why I support the work of the strategic efficiency and  effectiveness programme, and why I commissioned the review of prisons to scope  out the direction that change must take.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, change is happening already. Management has  reached agreement with the POA on how to work together to deliver change and  improvements; progress is being made to fill the governor-in-charge posts at  all three establishments; governance arrangements are being reviewed and  enhanced; and where mistakes have been made, they are being taken seriously and  lessons are being learned. I have said that change will take time. Rebuilding  public confidence will also take time, patience and resources. However, I am  committed to driving forward reform, and I know that the director general of  the Prison Service shares that conviction. I will be seeking the support of the  House in that absolutely essential task.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bresland</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answer. Prison Service running costs are very  high, and they are far higher than those in England,  Wales and Scotland. Will  the Minister outline how the costs for each prison might be reduced?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: Again, I suspect that that question will take rather longer to  answer than the two-minute limit that you have given me, Mr Deputy Speaker. We  have to acknowledge that the way that prison costs are calculated in Northern Ireland makes them different to those  in England, Wales and Scotland. For example, we include  matters, such as headquarter functions and education, that are not included in  other jurisdictions. We are also on a smaller scale, which makes things  different.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, the reality is that we still have higher costs. A  key element is that the construction of the prison estate and historical  reasons mean that, in many measures, we have significantly higher staffing  levels than is the case in other jurisdictions. For historical reasons that we  all know about, our prison officers are also paid significantly more than those  in other jurisdictions. Those are the sorts of issues that need to be addressed  to get the necessary reforms in place and to ensure that we can move to a  system that meets the needs of the future rather than continuing to act as  though it were dealing with the needs of the past.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  Does the Minister agree that public confidence in the prisons would be enhanced  by a clearer understanding of the purpose of the prison system, which is not to  simply lock prisoners up and throw away the key, but to rehabilitate them and  ensure that the level of reoffending is much reduced, thereby enhancing  community safety?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: It is absolutely clear that there are some people in this society  who believe that locking people up and throwing away the key is the solution to  our problems. Personally speaking, I do not think that we will make society  safer unless prisoners who are discharged have been rehabilitated while in  prison. That means that we need to spend money in a number of areas that might  not have been considered in previous ages when all that mattered was the  security at the perimeter.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If we are to make society safer and offer reform and  rehabilitation, it is clear to me that there are a number of areas in which  spending is required. Individuals might take cheap shots at such action, but it  is absolutely essential to rehabilitate and reform those who are in our care.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  The Minister referred to an agreement between prison management and the POA,  which I welcome, because it is progress. How confident is he that such an  agreement will be fully honoured? It is very important that the POA plays a  positive, constructive and progressive role in the reform of the Prison  Service.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: I entirely agree with the point that is being made. We will reform  the Prison Service by engaging management and staff in ensuring that we work to  make the reforms and changes that are vitally needed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The POA, which represents the great majority of uniformed  prison staff, is a key partner in that process. That is why I am extremely  pleased that management and the POA are discussing a pilot on a more efficient  and effective way of using staff within the different institutions. I regard  that as a sign of positive engagement, and I welcome the constructive  engagement by both sides on that. Obviously, I can give no guarantees on  whether that process will succeed, but I will continue to work with both sides,  in my role as Minister rather than as an operational manager, to ensure that  that process continues.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Security: Terrorism</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">7. <strong>Mr Bell </strong>asked the Minister of Justice, in light of the discovery of mortar devices  in County Kildare,  for an update on threats to Northern Ireland  from terrorists in the Republic   of Ireland.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 871/11)</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">8. <strong>Mr  McNarry </strong>asked the Minister of Justice for an update on the dissident  republican threat.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 872/11)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: With your permission, Mr Deputy Speaker, I will answer questions 7  and 8 together.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The threat from terrorists to Northern Ireland remains at a  severe level. I am sure that Members will join me in condemning all forms of  terrorist activity, including threats and intimidation, from whatever  organisation it comes. The attack on the Derry/Londonderry city of culture  office on 17 January is just one example of that distorted approach. I applaud  the response of the local community to that attack.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is no doubt that terrorists are planning and  preparing for misguided operations north and south of the border. That makes  cross-border co-operation absolutely essential, and there is excellent  co-operation. In launching the cross-border policing strategy, the Chief  Constable said that he was deeply indebted to his colleagues in an Garda  S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the level of support and co-operation that the PSNI receives on a  daily basis.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">For my part, I had regular discussions about security  matters with Dermot Ahern, the previous Minister of Justice, Equality and  Reform. I look forward to working with his successor, Brendan Smith, whom I met  last week. The most recent contacts with Dermot Ahern were in relation to the  Garda operation in County Kildare, which Mr Bell referred to in his question.  The success of such operations is in no small part due to the continued  excellent cross-border co-operation and information sharing between law  enforcement agencies, North and South.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The PSNI and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are alert to the threat and  the capacity of those groups and remain resolute in their determination to  disrupt and to prevent their activities. I commend both services for their  continued success in apprehending those responsible. In 2010, security force  activity resulted in 210 arrests and 80 charges. To date in 2011, there have  been 11 arrests and one person has been charged. In addition, 26 people  associated with terrorist groups were charged before the Special Criminal Court  in Dublin in 2010. To date in 2011, one person has been charged.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The commitment of the two police services to work together  is reflected in the cross-border policing strategy, which was published on 13  December 2010. It demonstrates that the breadth of co-operation that exists  across the full range of policing areas and the commitment of both services to  ensuring that those who seek to exploit the border for criminal ends do not do  so.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Minister&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>:  Will the Minister ensure that the men and women of our Police Service are  adequately resourced? Will he also ensure that the border is secured against  those who would come across to tackle them with either mortars or under-car  booby trap devices?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: As I made clear in my answers to earlier questions, I am doing my  best to ensure that the Police Service and the other agencies of the Department  of Justice are adequately resourced.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, I am not sure what he means by securing the  border, because, in the circumstances in which we live, the border area is not  the only area where those problems arise. What is most important is  co-operation across the border between the PSNI and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and I  see that being carried through at the highest level.</p>

    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Water Infrastructure</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">1. <strong>Lord  Morrow </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development to outline the estimated  cost and length of time it would take to bring NI Water&rsquo;s infrastructure up to  a European standard. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO  878/11)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development (Mr Murphy)</strong>: European Union standards for drinking  water focus on providing high quality drinking water for consumers. Although  there is no single fixed EU standard for water infrastructure, challenging  water quality standards continue to drive investment in water mains and  treatment facilities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">By the end of this financial year, the Executive will have  invested almost &pound;1 billion in our water and sewerage infrastructure, which  needs to continue if we are to catch up on years of past underinvestment. Going  forward, the Utility Regulator has determined the level of investment that NI  Water should make, and, despite overall budgetary constraints, I have made  proposals in my Department&rsquo;s draft Budget to ensure that substantial levels of  investment continue. As a result of the investment that has been made, the  North now enjoys the highest drinking water quality compliance that it has ever  had, waste water treatment standards are also the best they have ever been and  even overall leakage has been reduced.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  I heard what the Minister said, but I am not sure that he answered the  question. We had a horrendous time over Christmas with what happened with  Northern Ireland Water (NIW), and are continually told that it will take  something like &pound;4 billion to bring our water infrastructure up to standard &mdash;  which may not be European standards. Will the Minister confirm whether there is  any truth in those figures and whether we are only currently one quarter of the  way there in our investment?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: The Member is correct. There are some European  standards, but they change frequently and not all of the investment that NIW  makes is set against those particular standards. Indeed, if it did it would  never finish its work, as the EU always improves and adds new regulations and  requirements that require continued investment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I said, there has been an investment by the Executive  and by me of almost &pound;1 billion, which is a substantial improvement. The Member  may remember 2007, when we were on the brink of infraction costs from Europe  due to pollution and a large number of our water treatment facilities were not  up to the standard that Europe demanded and required significant investment. We  have now moved well beyond that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A substantial investment has been made. The Member, like  all other Members, will be aware that we have been playing catch-up due to a  lack of investment over many decades. It is not possible to put a final figure  on it, as there will be a continuous need for further investment in the water,  sewerage and waste water treatment infrastructure. There has been an investment  of &pound;1 billion, and something in the region of &pound;660 million is proposed over the  next four years of the draft Budget period, which has yet to be agreed. No  doubt we will need to make further investments in water and sewerage services  after that.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Leonard</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. The Minister had just started to  answer my question. Will he further outline the Department&rsquo;s spending plans for  NI Water over the next four years?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: As I said in answer to the previous question, I am  committed to ongoing investment in the water and sewerage infrastructure. However,  unfortunately, as people will know, budgets, and particularly capital budgets,  have taken a significant hit. The money that I was allocated in the draft  Budget fell substantially short of what was required to fund NI Water in years  two and three, and I have, therefore, proposed that additional funding be  reallocated within my draft Budget to partially address that shortfall. If that  position is agreed at the end of the Budget discussions, that will bring the  total investment over the four years of the draft Budget to some &pound;660 million.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I heard what the Minister said, but whatever way we look at it there will be a  shortfall of &pound;48 million compared to the amount that the regulator, Northern  Ireland Water and the Minister agreed as necessary for the modernisation of  Northern Ireland Water. How can that modernisation be achieved if there is such  a shortfall?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: The shortfall is greater than the Member outlined.  The agreed figure was some &pound;200 million a year, which would have brought the  total to &pound;800 million through the allocation that I have received and the  amount that I have proposed to add internally in the Department for Regional  Development (DRD). In years two and three, there was a &pound;100 million shortfall  in the allocation that I received &mdash; a total shortfall of &pound;200 million. I have  allocated additional internal resources because it is important to maintain  investment in water and sewerage services. Those additional moneys bring the  total up to &pound;660 million over the four-year period, if that is agreed at the  end of the period.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I sympathise entirely with the Member&rsquo;s view, but many  worthy projects &mdash; water and sewerage, roads, rail, public transport and  concessionary fares &mdash; require investment. I have put forward draft proposals  for consultation for my budget over the next four years, and I look forward to  comments from others. However, if people are making the case that additional  investment is needed in one particular area, as the Member appears to argue,  they are obliged to tell me from which area the money should come.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lyttle</strong>:  Does the Minister think that greater flexibility for NI Water&rsquo;s annual finance  would avoid underspend and improve the organisation&rsquo;s ability to use all  capital funds available for water network improvements?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: NIW has been fairly successful over the past number  of years in spending its allocation and in making sure that projects are  initiated: &pound;1 billion is a significant investment, and the vast majority of  that money has been spent on time and in acccordance with plans. A couple of  projects were tripped up this year by planning or land acquisition issues.  Sometimes, in big capital projects, unforeseen or unpredictable issues affect  whether money can be spent.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When money is allocated to projects that, for whatever  reason, do not go forward, it is the normal practice in the Executive that  those moneys are surrendered. That is the case across all Departments. The  Executive have the flexibility to decide then, as a whole, whether the moneys  need to go back to NIW to another investment or should be allocated to another  area or applied to pressures that may arise in a particular year. Last year,  some of the money that was surrendered after the swine flu outbreak was  reallocated.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">NI Water: Secretary of State</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">2. <strong>Mr Cree </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development to outline any discussions that  he has had with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland about NI Water  since 1 December 2010. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO  879/11)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I met the Secretary of State on Wednesday 29 December  and again on Thursday 30 December to discuss options for assisting Northern  Ireland Water.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his prompt reply. I am glad to hear that the Secretary  of State was at least aware of the situation. Can the Minister tell the House  whether any assistance was offered from central government?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: When I met the Secretary of State on 29 December and  on 30 December after the Executive meeting we had a general discussion about  what support could be offered. I seem to recall that on the Wednesday he  offered us every assistance except finance. That, of course, is the big issue  that NI Water faces. The Tory-led Government in Britain is cutting finance in  the form of capital allocations. We had discussions on Wednesday 29 December  when the Secretary of State offered to make whatever assistance he could &mdash;  other than finance &mdash; available to us, and we continued those discussions on  Thursday 30 December.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>:  Does the Minister agree that the cuts imposed on Northern Ireland by the  Conservative Government in coalition with the Liberal Democrats will pose a  major problem for us in ensuring that our water infrastructure is up to speed  and ready for the twenty-first century?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: The Member will be aware that part of the problem  that the Executive have been dealing with collectively is the lack of  investment over many decades of direct rule Governments, Conservative and  Labour. We have made a substantial contribution, particularly to water and  sewerage services, and have moved on since 2007, when we were in danger of  having to pay infraction costs and fines from the European Union for pollution.  The Executive made a significant investment of &pound;1 billion. Obviously, a 40% cut  to our capital budget presents significant challenges. As Members identified  during the discussion that followed my previous question, the money that the  regulator agreed was required by NIW has not been made available to me under  the draft Budget, because the Executive are grappling with capital cuts across  all areas of departmental spending, including health, education and regional  development. I have had to reallocate money internally to try to meet some of  that pressure, but it is not the amount that the regulator agreed was required  for NIW.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  Does the Minister intend to meet his Scottish, Welsh and English counterparts  to seek a strengthening of the UK water mutual aid scheme? Does he have plans,  or has he taken any action, to meet his Southern counterpart to discuss an  all-island scheme of a similar nature?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: In relation to meeting my counterparts in Britain,  the mutual aid arrangements operate between water companies, not between  Departments. The Deputy First Minister of the Scottish Government and I had a  conversation to try to ensure that those arrangements, particularly in relation  to the Scottish water supply, were put in place as seamlessly as possible, and  we tried to apply some political support for action. However, it is,  essentially, an arrangement between Scottish Water and NI Water. All other  mutual aid arrangements also operate between the companies themselves, not  between Departments. Nonetheless, as part of the review, I expect that NIW will  examine the mutual aid arrangements and, if there is any need to improve or  alter them in any way, it will consider that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As far as the South is concerned, my Department has  suggested that network issues be examined as part of the St Andrews review. In  the South, the water supply is operated not by a Department or an agency within  a Department, but by county councils. Nonetheless, there is an argument,  particularly in the border areas, for looking at whether the networks can be  harmonised in any way to ensure that any loss of supply to a particular area  would be sustainable. I thanked Louth County Council, which offered a supply to  Newry and Mourne in the middle of the recent incident.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Water Leaks: Business Premises</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">3. <strong>Mr  Elliott </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development whether businesses  which experienced leaks on their properties during the recent adverse weather  and water shortage crisis will be charged for the additional water. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 880/11)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I have been advised by NI Water that damage or  defects that result in leakage from customer supply pipes can occur at any time  of year. That is why NIW makes a considerable effort to remind customers of the  need to check regularly for leaks on their properties. That message was  restated continually during the recent freeze and subsequent thaw.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">NIW has advised that it developed its current arrangements  for dealing with payment for water lost from customers&rsquo; pipes in 2008. Under  those arrangements, non-domestic customers who are billed on a metered basis  will be charged for the water that has been recorded by the meter, whether used  or lost through leakage within the property. However, billed customers who have  experienced a leak and who are connected to the public sewer can apply for a  reduction of the sewerage bill, in recognition that the leaked water would not  have returned to the sewer. NI Water is not responsible for the supply pipe  within the customer&rsquo;s property and encourages property owners to protect and  maintain their private pipes. It is not reasonable to expect other customers or  the taxpayer to bear the cost of water wastage arising from leaks to private  pipes.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his answer. When there is a burst in the public water  infrastructure of Northern Ireland Water, everyone has to pay for it. Will the  Minister give us some indication of the amount of water that leaked from the  public pipe infrastructure of Northern Ireland Water during the recent crisis?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: As the public water infrastructure is owned by the  public, they should pay for leaks. It is not reasonable to suggest that the  public or the taxpayer should also pay for a fault in someone&rsquo;s private supply.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">During the recent freeze-thaw incident, 70% of the bursts  were on the private side, but what that equates to in volume is still being  worked out by NIW. When the figures are available, I will provide them to the  Member.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  The Minister is aware that, following his previous statement to the House, I  asked him what consideration could be given to people living in rural areas  when there are leaks in their properties, particularly in an agricultural  setting. In light of his previous answer, has any further consideration been  given to those who are not connected to the public supply?</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: As I said, the difficulty is that the position that  has been in effect since April 2008 &mdash; a position that compares favourably with  companies operating in England and Wales &mdash; means that if the leakage occurs on  the private side of the meter supply, it is an issue for the property owner.  People who are attached to the public sewer can discuss that part of their bill  with NIW.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am afraid that the position is that people are  responsible for their private pipes. During the freeze period, and during the  thaw when problems were becoming more and more identifiable, a substantial  appeal was put out for people to check their private supply to ensure that it  was turned off. Indeed, where it came across leaks, NIW turned off many  properties&rsquo; supply itself. However, a general appeal was regularly issued for  people to check their supply and ensure that it was stopped if there was a leak  on their property.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  The Minister issued a general direction on 30 December that had the effect of  denying customers their right to seek legal redress from Northern Ireland Water  for damages caused as a result of loss of supply. What alternative compensation  methods does the Minister propose to introduce to ensure customer rights so  that customers are not the big losers from the crisis?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I have explained this to the Member on a number of  occasions now, particularly in Committee where I had this very discussion with  him. I fail to see his priorities. Rotation of supply &mdash; where NI Water  deliberately stops the supply in places to maintain a certain level of supply &mdash;  is a common practice in Ireland and Britain. It is done to protect vital  supplies.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McDevitt&rsquo;s priority appears to be the ability of some  people possibly to pursue NIW through the courts for costs. That priority is  set against maintaining vital supplies for hospitals, care facilities and other  places in and around Belfast. To be honest, if the same situation were to  reoccur, I think that the correct decision, time and time again, would be to  ensure that NIW had the authority to stop supplies to protect vital supplies.  That would ensure that people&rsquo;s lives were not put in danger. Mr McDevitt  appears to be arguing in favour of allowing people to continue to receive their  service, regardless of the consequences, so compensation claims can be pursued.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">School Transport: Adverse Weather  Conditions</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">4. <strong>Mr Frew </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development to detail the arrangements in  place between Translink, Roads Service and the education and library boards in  the event of adverse weather conditions to ensure the safety of pupils  travelling to school.&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 881/11)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: Translink has an extreme weather procedure which  outlines its processes in adverse conditions. Given the likely localised nature  of problems, the key contact on public transport is between the local bus depot  and its schools. They deal with issues such as the closing and reopening of  schools, possible bus route changes and any withdrawal of services. They should  also formally liaise with divisional Roads Service offices.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Education and library boards are responsible solely for the  safety of pupils who are eligible for transport assistance. Boards have devised  guidance for contractors, schools and parents on pupil safety during periods of  adverse weather. The guidance is available on the websites of the North Eastern  Board, Southern Board and South Eastern Board, with the remaining boards to  follow.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Frew</strong>:  School principals, parents, bus drivers and, indeed, Translink managers have  contacted me to say that there are a number of roads that are not treated in  times of ice and snow, yet are school bus routes. Can the Minister assure the  House that he will review the gritting policy to include that small number of  roads so that we can protect our children as much as is physically possible?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: Gritting criteria were agreed by the Assembly in  2001-02. They have been amended slightly to take into account some rural  issues, particularly in relation to schools. Bear in mind that we spent twice  as much last year as is normally set aside for winter, and I am sure that this  year it will probably be the same again. There is a very significant cost  attached to gritting roads, so criteria were set based on the number of  vehicles that travel along a route. Under the criteria, school buses account  for 40 vehicles. It is not possible to salt every single route on which a  school bus travels, but there is certainly an attempt to provide as good a  quality of service as is possible within the constraints currently in place in  Roads Service.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms M Anderson</strong>: Go raibh  m&iacute;le maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I seek some clarity from the Minister.  Does that mean that the school salting policy has been revised or adjusted  during this time?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: The school salting policy has been revised during  this period and, indeed, during my period in office in DRD. We asked for  information from the education and library boards about which rural schools, in  particular, had a difficulty opening over the winter period. In September 2009,  I made a statement to the Assembly on the outcome of that examination of winter  services around rural schools. In that statement, I announced that there would  be enhanced communications and priority secondary salting for the 46 schools  that were most affected by the weather conditions throughout the winter of  2008-09.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We asked the education and library boards themselves for  information about which schools had difficulties. The names of 46 schools were  forwarded to us, and those are earmarked for particular attention. Some of  those schools might not have been affected this winter, and others will have  been. There is flexibility in the arrangements to ensure that it is brought to  the attention of the local Roads Service division if schools are having  particular difficulties with opening and getting pupils in.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  I will follow up on Mr Frew&rsquo;s question. The pavements in the areas surrounding  schools can be dangerous for everyone who walks on them. Has the Minister had  meetings with the Minister of the Environment to discuss resources or  guidelines on how the pavements around schools, and other such public places,  should be gritted in times of such awfully cold weather?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: The Department and Roads Service have worked with  NILGA and spoken to local government about the priority areas for the gritting  of footpaths. The Minister of the Environment issued a public statement in the  earlier part of the winter that encouraged councils to become involved in that  process.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is a difficult area. Councils that are involved are  faced with a question of priority. Roads Service supplies schools with salt  boxes to salt the areas around their premises. There is a recognition that it  can be difficult for people to come in. However, the resources that are used  for that come out of the budget for road maintenance and things like that. The  use of resources for whatever number of weeks of cold weather has to be weighed  against the use of resources for road safety measures, traffic-calming  measures, structural maintenance and so on. The Department and Roads Service  have to make the choice of whether to allocate resources to this issue as  opposed to allocating resources to ensuring road safety in all the other weeks  and months of the year, when cold weather is not the issue.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">A2 Carrickfergus to Greenisland</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">5. <strong>Mr  Beggs </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development for his assessment of the  impact of the cancellation of the proposed A2 Greenisland road-widening scheme  on traffic congestion between Carrickfergus and Greenisland.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 882/11)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: In recent years, Roads Service has continued with the  development of the A2 Shore Road/Greenisland scheme. However, as I have stated  previously, the final statutory notice, vesting order and progression of the  scheme to procurement will be subject to the availability of resources in  future years&rsquo; budgets. As the Member will be aware, a reduction of 40% in the  Executive&rsquo;s overall capital funding from Treasury in the 2011-15 period means  that there are now funding constraints.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My Department is now faced with the difficult task of  having to allocate finite resources to numerous demands for the maintenance,  management and development of the transport network. Unfortunately, when those  competing priorities are taken into consideration, I am unable to progress  plans to start construction on the A2    Shore Road scheme during this Budget period. The  impact of the postponement of the scheme will mean that the bottleneck between  Jordanstown and Seapark, as identified in the Belfast metropolitan transport plan, will  remain until such time as highway improvements can be implemented.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his answer. However, in prioritising the roads  expenditure programme, how is the Minister taking into consideration the level  of daily congestion on that route at Greenisland and its effect on emergency  response? Response police officers are now based not in Carrickfergus but in  Whiteabbey. The A&amp;E is no longer at Whiteabbey, and, therefore, people  sometimes have to travel from parts of east Antrim not to Whiteabbey or Antrim  but to the Mater or the Royal.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: Very difficult choices have had to be made. My  proposed budget is out for consultation, and I am sure that the Member and,  indeed, other Members will be able to put forward their views on it. We have to  weigh up the very significant capital cuts that we have received from the  coalition Government in Britain.  The A2 is a very worthy scheme. No one doubts the congestion there or the  requirement for a scheme, which has been well established. However, that has to  be weighed up against sinking a substantial part of the Department&rsquo;s budget  over the next four years into one scheme. Doing that would involve neglecting  structural maintenance right across the Six Counties and neglecting the  investment that is required in public transport. Additional investment also  needs to be made in water and sewerage services. Those are the types of choices  that the Department is faced with in setting a budget that is very significantly  constrained by decisions taken elsewhere. I put it forward in the draft Budget.  I very much appreciate that people will be disappointed that the proposal is  that the A2 scheme should not now go ahead. They can certainly make their point  about that. However, as I said, the Member should bear in mind that the  inclusion of that scheme would have a detrimental effect on other areas of  spend across the Department&rsquo;s budget.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  I thank the Minister for that very comprehensive answer. Given the level of  opposition to the A5, will the Minister tell the House whether it will be  possible to transfer funding for the A5 to the A2, which, as he just said, is a  necessary scheme and which has been going on for such a long time? Failing  that, I remind the Minister about the CAF trains that are due to arrive. Could  they perhaps not be an alternative?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: Road schemes are decided according not to popularity,  but on a whole range of measures. The A5 Derry to Aughnacloy road scheme is an  agreed project between the Executive, in their entirety, and the Dublin  Government. Funding has been set in place and rolled out for that scheme. That  continued to be the case until as late as last Friday&rsquo;s North/South meeting, at  which all parties in the Executive were represented. I continue to approve that  project. As I said, the Executive set that priority down in their dealings with  the Dublin Government through the North/South arrangements.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As part of both the investment and the Department&rsquo;s attempt  to move money around to allocate it according to priorities, there has been a  continued prioritisation of investment in the additional trains. I hope that  those will be in service as soon as possible, as scheduled, on the Larne line  and that they will add to the public transport network in that part of the  North.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Will the Minister give details of  which proposed strategic capital projects are being given priority in the draft  Budget?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: A range of projects are involved, some of which I  have identified. Those include the A5 and A8 schemes, which are agreed projects  between the Executive and the Government in Dublin. As regards investment in the railway,  we have 20 additional trains. There is also an investment in the Derry to Coleraine line. As I outlined in response to an  earlier question, there is some &pound;660 million of investment in water and  sewerage services. We have managed to protect the concessionary fares schemes,  even though no money was allocated against it in the draft allocation that I  received. We have also put more money in to public transport to protect jobs.  The Executive agreed generally to make it a priority for Ministers to try as  best they could, with the resources allocated to them and the additional  resources that they identified, to protect public services and jobs. I have  certainly tried to achieve that in my Department, and I hope that all Ministers  have tried to do the same.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Water Leaks: Powers of Entry</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">6. <strong>Mr G  Robinson </strong>asked the Minister for Regional Development if he will consider  legislation to allow NI Water engineers to gain entry to a property, with a  police escort, to shut off a water supply when a leak is affecting neighbouring  properties.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 883/11)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: The Water and Sewerage Services Order 2006 provides a  range of powers to deal with the waste, contamination and misuse of water. It  allows NI Water to disconnect premises in certain circumstances where there may  be damage to property. NI Water can also require remedial work to be carried  out to take those steps itself and to recover expenses where there is some  waste, misuse or contamination of water. In some circumstances, powers of entry  already exist to inspect water fittings or to take remedial measures. In  addition, it is an offence to contaminate, waste or misuse water. Although I am  content that powers exist, the review into the severe weather emergency could  examine that.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Robinson</strong>:  Will the Minister tell the House whether domestic properties that are affected  by a leak from a neighbouring property, such as a business property, can be  supplied with priority bottled water until the leak is repaired?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: The Executive have instigated a review into the  particular incident that occurred at Christmas. As regards the substantive  question about powers of entry, NIW has the power to stop a water supply to  premises where it can clearly identify that water is being lost. However, it is  sometimes difficult to identify the source of a leak in a building with  multiple occupants. I think that there were issues with the availability of  emergency supplies and with the lines of communication about how people could  avail themselves of those supplies. Those carrying out the investigation into  that incident will want to look at that. I hope that we will be better placed  at the end of February to discuss those issues and to decide what steps need to  be taken in the future.</p>

    <p class="OralAnswers-H1Heading"><a name="f" id="f"></a>Question for Urgent Oral Answer</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H2DepartmentHeading">Health, Social Services and Public  Safety</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Royal Belfast   Hospital for Sick  Children</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong> asked the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, given today&rsquo;s  media coverage on the leaked report into standards of care at the Royal Belfast  Hospital for Sick Children suggesting that there may be a very real risk that  children will come to harm, to outline the main recommendations in the report  and to give an assurance to patients, parents and staff that the services are  up to standard.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr McGimpsey)</strong>: I wish to state  that the reports in the media on this issue in the past 24 hours have been  inaccurate and unhelpful. The review was not triggered by any serious adverse  incident (SAI) but was undertaken as part of the normal performance and service  improvement role of the Health and Social Care Board. The Belfast Health and  Social Care Trust asked the interim management and support (IMAS) team to visit  the trust&rsquo;s urgent and emergency care programme for children to compare it with  known good practice and to make recommendations for improvements and  modernisation. The IMAS team stated that it was impressed by the huge  commitment and enthusiasm of clinical and managerial staff in all departments.  In particular, it was apparent that there was widespread commitment to team  working, multidisciplinary care and a very real patient focus. Daily inpatient  reviews and consultant-delivered care were as expected in a paediatric hospital  and clearly helped to facilitate timely discharge.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The team also identified that the children&rsquo;s hospital  clearly requires redevelopment. The emergency department is cramped, with  insufficient space to deliver modern care processes. The main areas identified  for improvement by IMAS were medical staffing, nursing staffing levels,  triaging issues, governance and admission of children to adult wards. The  Health and Social Care Board has provided additional resources to increase  staffing levels, locum staff and a middle-grade doctor are in place, and the  consultant post is being filled. All other recommendations have been addressed  by the trust and the Health and Social Care Board.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is no suggestion that any child has been exposed to  any untoward event, and, on the basis of the report, I can assure patients,  parents and staff that services in the Royal Belfast   Hospital for Sick  Children are up to standard.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I am highly disappointed that,  over the past two weeks, I have had to use questions for urgent oral answer to  get information from the Minister. I am a member of the Committee for Health,  Social Services and Public Safety, but I have not seen the report that the  Minister says is being reported inaccurately in the media and, therefore,  cannot make a judgement.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Information in the public domain states that the report  says that the Belfast Trust, when compared with other training hospitals, needs  an appropriate number of senior decision-makers. It is also stated that  staffing <strong>levels fall well below what is  considered safe and acceptable and, indeed, were</strong>:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;very low in comparison with other hospitals we have  visited&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Ten months on, staffing levels have not improved.  Given that it has been identified, on the basis of comparisons, that 20  additional middle-grade doctors and a number of consultants are needed, the  situation has not improved. How many SAIs  involving the children&rsquo;s hospital have been investigated over the past five  years?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: The Member asked a number of  questions. Given that the children&rsquo;s hospital is a regional centre, SAIs are normal because  very sick children are referred there. Deaths, sadly, do occur, but SAIs are usually referred  from donor hospitals.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Staffing levels are in the public domain, but I am happy to  furnish the Member with those details.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member refers to a report, but it was, in fact, a  one-day visit by IMAS, which prompted a letter. IMAS is a consultancy made up  of UK-wide National Health Service managers who make suggestions about  improvements. Suggestions were made about the children&rsquo;s hospital. IMAS said  not that the service was unsafe but that the rota was unsafe. The rota was  unsafe in that, when it was unable to be filled, locums had to be brought in.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There was an issue around nursing staff levels, which has  been addressed. Similarly, there was an issue around medical staffing levels,  which has been and is being addressed. Resources have been made available.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Other issues were raised about the admission of children to  adult wards. If you had listened to Dr Paul Jackson this morning, you would  have been able to hear him say that no child under the age of 13 was admitted  to an adult ward. There are issues about accommodation, and those issues have  been well made by me, over and over again. I have asked Ms Ramsey and others in  this House to give me the support to build a new children&rsquo;s hospital. To date,  this House has failed to give me that support.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  The money was there.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I am trying to give an answer,  Mr Deputy Speaker, without the heckling. This is a very serious issue, and it  is unfortunate that it should descend to that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There were also issues around the triaging of patients &mdash;  those who should go to their out-of-hours service or GP surgery, those with  minor injuries and those who are suitable for an emergency department. Those  issues have also been addressed. IMAS has visited a number of trusts. That is  normal business, because the board has been charged with performance management  and improvement of the Health Service. I told the House on a number of  occasions that I will improve performance in the Health Service; we are doing  that, and the staff are responding magnificently.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Suggestions that an unsafe service is being operated by our  clinicians, doctors and nurses in the Royal Belfast   Hospital for Sick  Children are entirely wrong. I think that it is very unfair on the staff, who  were described as very enthusiastic, very patient-focused and skilled. They are  providing a first-class service in a building that should have been replaced  long ago. It is substandard accommodation. The letter from IMAS gave some  suggestions, and there is a report in the media that the service is unsafe. I  note that some MLAs commented on it in the newspaper. They complain that they  have not read the letter, and then they complain about the contents &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  We cannot get it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: It is available. I will publish  it today. If you want, I will publish every single report, every single letter  and every single piece of paper. However, I assure you, as I said yesterday,  that you would need a lorry to carry away the paper.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mrs  O&rsquo;Neill)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Today provides just  another example of the flippant attitude of the Minister towards the scrutiny  of the Health Committee. This is the second time in as many weeks that we have heard  detailed and worrying reports in the media.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Minister, according to John Compton on media outlets this  morning, you became aware of the report only in the past number of weeks. Given  that the report was published in March 2010, I do not think it good enough for  you, as Minister, to be made aware of something only because it was going to be  made public. Perhaps you will say whether you are aware of any other IMAS  investigations ongoing and what services it has been reviewing, and maybe you  will tell the House more about that today.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Also, Minister; given the fact that the RQIA has a role to  play in ensuring quality in the Health Service, are you concerned that it has  not picked up on the serious issues that have been identified? You have  referred to the fact that staffing levels were not of concern. The IMAS report  states that the current staffing levels within the hospital fall:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;well below what we consider safe and acceptable, and  indeed are very low in comparison with other hospital that we have visited&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That is not good enough, and that is what you need  to answer in the House today.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: First, talking about &ldquo;worrying  reports&rdquo; spreads undue alarm. It was actually a letter written as a result of a  one-day visit, which made suggestions on how we could improve the service.  Those suggestions have been actioned. That is not unusual. Indeed, you  mentioned the RQIA, which routinely reports and carries out inspections. I do  not routinely see its reports on nursing homes. I see them when they are  adverse or when there are issues or major problems. IMAS has also visited and  advised the Northern Trust, Southern Trust, Western Trust and the board. It  advises on good practice and performance.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is not an unsafe service. Some of the staffing and  nursing levels were raised, but, as I said in my answer, there is no suggestion  that any child has been exposed to any untoward event. On the basis of the  report, I assure patients, parents and staff that services in the Royal Belfast   Hospital for Sick  Children are up to standard.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I refer the Deputy Chairperson of the Health Committee to  what that Committee is supposed to be about. If she wants to micromanage the  Health Service and wants every single report and letter, thousands of which are  generated each week, I could probably furnish her with those. However, I do not  see how that would add in any way to what the Committee is required to do. The  functions of the Committee are laid down quite clearly, and I try to provide it  with all the information that I can, as is required.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Ms Ramsey said that this was the second time that she has  had to come to the House. If she has to ask a question, she should ask it.  Alternatively, she can come to my office. The door is always open, and she has  been in my office routinely. The notion that I have to stand here and &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  Why not make a statement and be proactive?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I can make as many statements as  the Member wants. I have made countless statements to the House. However, this  issue arose in a morning newspaper. As I said, that morning newspaper report is  inaccurate and unhelpful. It is particularly unhelpful in respect of staff  morale. They are doing their absolute best and are working very hard, which is  recognised in the letter. If the Member wants to do so, she should talk to me.  I talk to her daily. I do not see any reason why she cannot do that. If she  wants to do that formally in the form of a statement, I can do that by all  means. However, if the Member wants statements every time a newspaper writes an  inaccurate and unhelpful report, we will all be here all day every day.</p>

It is a shame that we had to stop earlier because a good debate was bubbling  just before the break. Mr Weir made some good points that need to be refuted  and discussed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As we all know, the rates support grant is absolutely vital  for councils, particularly for the less wealthy, which excludes Mr Weir&rsquo;s  constituency and probably mine. It is absolutely vital for all the others. It  is vital for their financial health and to allow them to provide the basic  statutory services that all councils must provide. I accept that, from time to  time, there may be a need to change funds or to cut throughout the year.  However, it is wrong to do it in the middle of the year because councils will  need to find the funding from other means but not the age-old one of trying to  hit the Health Service, which is so vital to us all. I find the plastic bag  levy slightly unusual, as it would mean that the more we spend on plastic bags,  the more funds we will have. I am sure that the Minister will say more about  that. There is always room for cuts in other places, but it is completely wrong  to finance it from councils in the middle of the year when they do not have any  means within a year, other than by cutting their plans for that year, to raise  funds.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Weir spoke about the possibility of a tsunami of cuts  and said that we needed to act swiftly. Over the past few months, however, we  have seen that we have not acted swiftly when probably the biggest tsunami ever  is coming towards us. Yes, there is a need to cut back &mdash; it is sad that we have  to do so &mdash; but not from council budgets in the middle of the year. I do not  think that we &mdash;</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>: I  thank the Member for giving way. Is it not the Conservative Government, for  whom he was campaigning a number of months ago, who have imposed those huge  cuts on Northern Ireland?  Does he not feel a sense of shame that he has brought to Northern Ireland  a manifesto that has cut our public services &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. I remind Members that we are talking about the Bill. The  election has not started yet.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  Thank you very much, Mr Deputy Speaker. If I was casting a fly, it was well and  truly taken by Mr Bell. We know that the only reason why we have these cuts is  the bad spending of the previous Government, which his party supported.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Going back to amendment No 3, I remind everyone that we are  talking about stopping it being possible to cut back on vital funding to  councils. I know that some Members who are councillors know what it is like  when Land and Property Services suddenly decides that a council has not paid  enough rates. On Antrim Borough Council, we had to find &pound;1 million and then  &pound;0&middot;5 million in the middle of a year, ending up with the council having to cut  back on all the things it had been doing until we got to the absolute basics.  Today, we are trying to protect councils so that we do not throw them into  disarray in the middle of the year but have proper budgeting and proper  consultation before setting the rates for next year. We have seen, in the  process that budgets are going through at the moment, that we can plan it for  the next year with cuts in other areas at the moment. I support amendment No 3.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. As a member of the Environment  Committee, I, too, support the Committee&rsquo;s amendment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The very idea of in-year clawback has raised an awful lot  of concern on councils, particularly those west of the Bann, which are the most  likely to be affected by clawbacks. In fact, that widespread and growing  concern about the increase in departmental powers to make in-year cuts to the  rate support grant could, if you like, in terms of its implications for  management in councils, lead to chaos where schemes have already started and  budgets have already been determined in compliance with an evaluation of  incoming rates and outgoing expenditure for the coming financial year as  already authorised, with the consequent impact on the level of rates in each  district. Therefore, the ability afforded to government to claw back some of  those moneys could have serious implications, particularly in areas of higher  deprivation. Of course, we know that the rate support grant is paid only to  councils whose wealth per head of population falls below the Northern Ireland  average. For areas of high deprivation, therefore, we are talking about  targeting social need in reverse, because, at the stroke of a pen, we could  open the door to the potential to inflict further deprivation, as acknowledged  by the calculation of the wealth in those areas.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The internal management issues can probably be worked  through in councils, but the knock-on effect for projects, communities and  community and voluntary sector organisations funded by councils could be  inordinate and have serious implications for areas of high and growing  unemployment across the North. The districts and communities affected most by  potential clawback are those least able to afford it. Therefore, in moving  amendment No 3, the Committee has got it right: we cannot open the floodgates  to further hardship in areas that have suffered enough, are recognised,  according to the Government&rsquo;s assessment method, as having deprivation indices  above and beyond other areas and need, therefore, to be supported. Therefore,  in conclusion, from the SDLP&rsquo;s point of view and as a member of the Committee,  I support the amendment.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  declare an interest as a member of North Down Borough Council though, as Mr  Weir said, that is probably a technicality in this case in that we have not  received resource grant for quite some time. However, it is important to  acknowledge that this is not just an issue of councillors fighting their own  corner. I am certainly here to speak on behalf of the Alliance Party and to  take a cross-Northern Ireland  perspective on the issue. It is important to acknowledge the differences in the  relative rates base across councils in Northern   Ireland, and it is important that central government  funds are used to equalise, to an extent, the lack of equalisation in rates  bases in different councils to, at least, provide the potential for parity in  how the citizens of Northern    Ireland receive government services.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Like others, I noted Peter Weir&rsquo;s comments with interest.  My party is inclined to support the Committee&rsquo;s amendment because it sends a  positive signal to local government as a whole. Mr Weir cites the concerns  about the potential for clawback to happen during the in-year monitoring  process and that, although no one particularly envisages that, it is important  that the flexibility is on the books. In return, I could cite many other  examples across government, not just in councils or the Department of the  Environment, where there are already inescapable pressures or contractual  obligations. Whenever government faces such a clawback, there are areas that  are, for those reasons, off limits. It is important that we do not send a  signal to the councils that they are simply there for picking off. As others  have said, councils have a responsibility, in turn, to plan their own budgets  for the year and to fund local community groups and other organisations as well  as provide continuity of services from those budgets. Therefore, it is  important that councils have some degree of surety.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Weir set out an economic catastrophe on a huge scale,  and, to some extent, we have had a major economic disaster over the past number  of years. Councils already suffer in a range of ways outside the context of any  potential clawback of resource grant. For example, we already have a situation  where there is variation of the rates base through the penny product, which is  based on the property market. That impacts on areas such as building control  fees and can have a major impact on councils. Furthermore, councils receive  money from other aspects of government and arm&rsquo;s-length bodies for other  functions that can already be clawed back in-year or through which grants can  be withheld. Therefore, there are quite a lot of ways in which councils suffer  during economic downturns, just as central government does. We should not make  that any worse. We already have a situation where the Department has identified  the resource grant as an area for potential savings.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I could almost accept the argument that it is important for  the legislation to be flexible. However, we have to accept the wider context of  the tension between central government and local government, and it is  important that we send a signal of partnership, as far as possible, and,  indeed, try to develop wider contact between central government and local  government. In some respects, it does not really matter to me whether services  are funded by the local rates or by taxes. Ultimately, people pay out of their  pocket to fund government services regardless of whether a council or central  government provides them, with the one rider that we do not control the block  grant, which is linked to overall taxation, but have some influence over levels  of rates.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At present, more and more functions are being passed to  local government, and there are already Bills working their way through the  process, including the Dogs (Amendment) Bill, the Welfare of Animals Bill, the  Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Bill and others that are further down the  pipeline such as those on planning responsibilities, all of which will make  local government fulfil more and more functions that were previously fulfilled  by central government or not fulfilled at all. However, there is a concern  about the funding that will come with those functions. There is also a desire  to ensure that no undue burden is placed on the ratepayers. Again, I could  accept a shift in taxation towards the local rates, as long as that was done  transparently and not as part of a stealth agenda.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In turn, if we were to ask local government to do a lot  more without necessarily providing the finance, the expectation would be that  the Assembly and, particularly, Ministers and the Executive would not then  point to the fact that they were running very tight budgets and that rates in  local government were rising well above the rate of inflation and it needed to  get its act together. It would be wrong for us to end up in that situation,  because we have to disaggregate the reasons why rates were going up at local  level. Would it be because of inefficiencies in local government, which would  be very wrong and would need to be addressed? Alternatively, would it simply be  a reflection of the fact that local government was being asked to take on more  responsibilities and there would be a shift in the balance between central  government and local government, which some of us would welcome as an  enhancement of local democracy and something that is benign?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The notion of what happens in-year and with the resource  grant is part of a wider picture. It is important that we build a sense of  partnership between the two levels of government in Northern Ireland, that we see that  we are all working towards the same objective and that we do not have the  situation where people are being cut short and abandoned or where fingers are  being pointed in either direction.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr W Clarke</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I declare an interest as a  councillor on Down District Council, which receives the rate support grant.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I support amendment No 3. In summer 2010, the Department  announced the cut to the rate support grant. As a councillor, I know that that  brought great anxiety to and great pressure to bear on the council. The rate  had been struck, plans had been put in place, and officers from different  departments in the council were then faced with the great difficulty of having to  cut front line services.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Eighteen councils received the rate support grant, which  was cut by 5&middot;9%, resulting in &pound;1&middot;1 million being taken out of councils&rsquo;  financial plans when, as I said, councils had already set their budgets. We are  talking about front line services being affected. Sometimes that is glossed  over to mean something different, but, usually, community projects and front  line services are seen as easy options to hit. That must be borne in mind. A  cut such as that definitely puts the councils in a serious position, especially  when it happens in the middle of a financial year.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As has been outlined, the grants support councils that have  less revenue for each person in the population. The grant subsidises the  council to deliver services on the ground for ratepayers. Those services are  essential and &mdash; I will say it again &mdash; are front line services. The formula is  very fair, as it takes a number of factors into account, including  unemployment, the working population and areas of deprivation, as well as a lot  of other issues. Councils already find it difficult, and, as Mr Farry said,  responsibilities are coming from central government to local government. Those  will increase with the enactment of the Dogs (Amendment) Bill, the Welfare of  Animals Bill, the Planning Bill, the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Bill  and the High Hedges Bill. Indeed, the functions in a number of different pieces  of legislation are coming to local government.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I understand that the Department has to deal with cuts to  its budget, but councils do not have that flexibility in the financial year.  They cannot bid for extra resources to the Executive or the Assembly, so there  is no recourse for local government but to cut services. We felt that we had to  take the opportunity to protect vulnerable councils and ratepayers. A number of  members of the Committee, including those on the opposite Benches, found that  cutting the support to vulnerable councils in the west was totally  unacceptable.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, the Committee took the decision to bring the  issue to the Floor of the Assembly so that we can air our concerns and express  our serious reservations about it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, any reductions to the grant should be  carried out at the start of the year, and councils can then cut their cloth accordingly.  The intention of the amendment is to ring-fence the grant once it has been  agreed. It will bring certainty to the process for local government and for  everybody concerned. Sinn F&eacute;in supports the amendment. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment (Mr Poots)</strong>: I have given careful consideration to the  amendment proposed to the rates support grant, which is currently called the  resources element of the general grant by the Chairperson of the Committee for  the Environment. It is reflective of recent correspondence between my  Department and councils, in the wake of the reduction to the funding for the  grant in July 2010.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have considered the amendment, which seeks to protect  from in-year reductions the funding for the rates support grant to councils. In  the current financial climate, when we face significant reductions to the  levels of public funding, there remains a degree of uncertainty in respect of  what funding will be available for the delivery of vital public services.  Therefore, I cannot support the amendment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The setting of budgets and allocations is part of a wider  budget process, and rates support grant funding cannot and should not be  automatically exempt from that overarching process. In practical terms, the amendment  is overly restrictive and financially imprudent, impairing my Department&rsquo;s  freedom to manage the effects of changing financial circumstances over all its  business areas by exempting any one area of spend from the cuts during the  financial year.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will give a brief history of what happened in the last  year. Our Department had its funding set for the year and had no intentions of  making any cuts to councils or anybody else. However, lo and behold, we got a  new Government &mdash; the Conservative/Liberal Democrat Government. The franchisee &mdash;  the Ulster Unionist Party &mdash; is to my right, and the Alliance Party, a Member of  which was speaking a moment ago, is the sister party of the Liberal Democrats.  They imposed the cuts on the councils and the people of Northern Ireland,  not this Department.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Some Members spoke in a very hypocritical fashion about the  cuts to the councils when it was their sister parties that imposed those cuts  on the people of Northern    Ireland. They should hang their heads in  shame for the stance that they are taking on this issue. We, the people of Northern Ireland,  have to bear the cuts that they have imposed on us. The SDLP cannot get away  with it either because it is the sister party of the Labour Party, and it was  the Labour Party that got us into this financial mess. If Mr Kinahan wishes to  look at the record, he will identify that his party&rsquo;s MP voted more often with  the Labour Party than the DUP ever did. We were the real opposition in Westminster.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The impact of the cuts on our Department was 6%. We had a  meeting with representatives from the councils, and officers from Ards Borough  Council told us that the impact on their council was 0&middot;27% of its overall  budget. Strabane District Council was worst affected at 1&middot;12%. Derry City  Council was also represented, and we were told that the impact on it was 0&middot;23%  of its budget. Does anybody here want to make a rational argument as to why any  of those councils could not absorb that degree of a cut within the year when we  as a Department were cutting by 6%?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If Members go into the Lobbies to vote in favour of the  amendment, they will be saying that it is a good idea to cut the road safety  budget and the budget on environmental regulation, which will potentially put  us into a position of infraction proceedings, but it is not a good idea to ask  councils or local government to share some of the burden that is involved here.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I will give way in a moment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I mentioned that Derry City Council&rsquo;s reduction was 0&middot;23%.  A Member submitted a question to me about staff who are paid more than &pound;50,000  per annum. Derry City Council has 21 members of staff who are paid more than  &pound;50,000 per annum.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Compare that with Lisburn City Council, which is  actually larger: only six members of its staff are paid over &pound;50,000 per annum.  With regards to budget, it would be extremely easy for some councils to find  the necessary finance in-year. A great deal of fat exists in local government,  and councils are quite capable of absorbing the miniscule cuts asked of them. I  am happy to give way.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>: I  thank the Minister for giving way. I must challenge him on his point that it is  a good idea to cut the road safety budget. Minister, it is up to you to outline  your budget. The Committee will scrutinise it. The buck stops with you with  regard to what you bring forward. If you suggest that the road safety element  of the budget will be cut, that is up to you. However, the Committee will  challenge that. At no point did I, or any other Member, say that it was a good  idea to cut the road safety budget. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I certainly did not say that it was a good idea to cut the  road safety budget in-year. I said that if my Department is asked to find  funding and it excludes one element of its budget, that puts an onus on the  rest of the Department. Therefore, it is you people who will walk through the  Aye Lobby to support the amendment who will be saying that it is OK to cut the  road safety budget.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Just imagine if there were another crisis in health that  was even more significant than swine flu, that a call was made to Departments  to find funding to support the Department of Health and that a future Minister  of the Environment said: &ldquo;I cannot cut a particular element of my budget, so  you can count me out&rdquo;. Would Mr Farry&rsquo;s party say that it was a good idea to  cut the budgets for policing and the Prison Service but not the budget for  local government to support the Department of Health in such a crisis? God  forbid that republican terrorists actually achieved something and caused real  damage in the community, and the Assembly had to put significant funding into  policing. Would the Department of Health, which Mr Kinahan would want to  defend, have to stump up money to support the Department of Justice while local  government would not have to do so? Members, you really must look at the matter  logically instead of trying to score political points that will not benefit the  public or ratepayers in the long term.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  The Minister is missing the point. There is fat in councils that needs to be  cut. Minister, you are playing politics by asking Members whether we want to  see this or that cut. Cuts could be made in plenty of areas. What Members are  trying to get across is that although councils have ways of making in-year  cuts, you will not see that happen until the end of the year. Therefore, why  not wait until the end of the year and budget properly for the following year?  Councils could make cuts where possible out of fat in the middle of the year  and budget correctly for the next year. That would, therefore, be only a short  stop-gap for six or nine months. That could be done easily.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Before the Minister responds, I remind Members that they must make  all comments through the Chair: the only &ldquo;you&rdquo; in the Chamber is me.<span class="Italic"> [Laughter.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: Thank you very much, Mr Deputy Speaker. The longer the  debate goes on and the more I make my case, the more pathetic, perverse and  stupid I find the arguments in favour of the amendment. The Assembly should not  go down that route; it is not good legislation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is difficult to change one&rsquo;s position after one has  stated it publicly. However, I ask Members to reflect that if they do that and  the Assembly faces a future crisis or the Tory/Liberal Government go the way of  the Fianna F&aacute;il/Green Government in the South and has to introduce several  Budgets in one year and impose cut after cut, are Members really saying that  only local government should be exempt? Are we saying that the Department of  Health, the Department of Justice and the Department of Education are not  exempt and nor is any other Department? Are we saying that we can cut their  budgets but that the only budget we cannot cut is that for local government?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will go through the list of cuts: 0&middot;22%; 0&middot;23%; 0&middot;5%;  0&middot;58%; 0&middot;27%, and so on. They are miniscule; they could easily be absorbed. Any  council that has not put in place a prudent finance regime to absorb such cuts  in one year should question its finance officer.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">All of the councils were well capable of absorbing it, and  the piece of legislation that is being proposed through the amendment is  damaging to good governance, and Members should reflect on that.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for the Environment (Mr Boylan)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a  LeasCheann Comhairle. Following that soapbox effort, I will try to bring some  sense into what we are trying to do. I will go through Members&rsquo; comments, and I  will leave the Minister&rsquo;s comments to the end so that we can see exactly what  he was trying to explain to the House.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Weir talked about the problem with the amendment. He  said that ring-fencing could not be done from a legislative point of view and  that, perhaps, it was not good practice. He sat on the Committee with me for  the past four years, so I will not be bringing up anything about legislation.  It is up to the House to legislate, and there will be an opportunity to change  that at any time. I want to take that a wee bit further. In a couple of years&rsquo;  time, when there is a proper transfer of powers to local councils, they can  look at their budgets and implement them in whatever way they wish.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Weir also talked about local government being  sacrosanct. He must have had a bit of a rehearsal from the Minister, because he  mentioned road safety. The Environment Committee has been very strong in  supporting money for road safety and rolling out the road safety programme. The  Committee will not support reducing money for road safety, and it should not be  used as an argument in the House. The Minister mentioned taking away money from  road safety to give to councils. That is not the argument.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Weir also said that it was good practice not to have  in-year cuts. In the Assembly, there is, at least, an opportunity through the  monitoring system to recover some moneys. Councils, however, strike their rate  and set their programme for the year at the start of the year; they get only  one crack at it. The Minister&rsquo;s suggestion about having that is a wee bit  unfair.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Weir also talked about flexibility. Flexibility is OK  within central government, but they do not have it at local government level.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Kinahan talked about how vital the funding is for local  councils. He also gave examples of what has happened in his council area. I  agree. His main argument related to the fact that this whole thing is about  trying to protect in-year cuts. Minister, your colleague Mr Weir mentioned  tsunami. I know that your budget is not one of the biggest in the House, but  you said that &pound;1 million is a substantial amount of money from your budget to  be dished out to councils on a yearly basis. It is not a substantial amount of  money. The actual benefits of that money to the councils are tenfold.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: In the past few days, one council that did need it has  decided that its chief executive is not being paid enough in this financial  year. It has increased the chief executive&rsquo;s wage to over &pound;100,000 a year. That  is a rise of over &pound;10,000. It does not seem as if there are starving councils  out there, when you see examples of that type of behaviour.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for the Environment</strong>: Far be it from me to comment on an  individual council. Obviously, you have had an opportunity to discuss that with  councils in recent days. We are trying to secure the funding. It is not the  case that any of the councils have said what they need. You are playing  politics with it. Maybe you should take a look at trying to run your budgets  properly and financially.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I remind Members to make their comments through the Chair.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for the Environment</strong>: I am sorry, Mr Deputy Speaker. Mr  McGlone talked about the serious implications, especially for deprived areas. I  think that he is right in what he says about deprived areas. That is an issue  in itself. Not all of us come from affluent areas such as north Down, as Mr  Weir does. I think that there is good support for what Mr McGlone said. He also  spoke about employment opportunities on projects in the community. That would  have an impact in local areas.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Farry once again spoke very well, and his main point,  which is an important one, was about working in partnership. That is an issue  that we should be looking at. Mr Willie Clarke clearly outlined what the  amendment is about. It is about ring-fencing money at the start of the year to  give the councils an opportunity to set their own budgets.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Then the Minister spoke, and went into a political rant.  Maybe he is trying to indicate that all Members should go home, look in the  mirror and say that we are all stupid. He referred to the House and asked  whether we are all stupid, or words to that effect. Minister, maybe you should  look to your own budgets. It defies argument to say that the amount is  miniscule in relation to council budgets. If that is the case, why are you so  concerned about giving out so little money?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I remind the Member to address his remarks through the Chair and  not across the Chamber.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for the Environment</strong>: Sorry, Mr Deputy Speaker; OK. I would  like to think that the Members of the House will see a bit of common sense,  support the amendment and give local councils the opportunity to properly  outline their budgets for the year.</p>

    <p class="H4StageHeading"><a name="h"></a>Waste and Contaminated Land (Amendment) Bill: Final  Stage</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment (Mr Poots)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That the Waste and Contaminated   Land (Amendment) Bill  [10/09] do now pass.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not intend to rehearse the provisions of the Bill in  detail. Instead, I simply remind Members that the main purpose of this  important Bill is to legislate for a partnership approach between the  Department of the Environment and the local government sector in dealing with  illegal waste activity in Northern    Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill provides the Department and councils with the  legislative authority to deal effectively with fly-tipping and waste, and it  strengthens the enforcement powers of departmental and council officials. In  addition, the Bill makes necessary amendments to existing legislative provision  for the introduction of a contaminated land regime in Northern Ireland, mainly to reflect lessons  learned through operational experience in England  and Wales, and a minor  amendment to the Producer Responsibility Obligations (Northern Ireland)  Order 1998 to provide an inclusive definition of the Department&rsquo;s powers of  entry and inspection.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill was introduced in the Assembly on 22 March 2010  and completed its Committee Stage on 4 November 2010 with the production of the  Committee for the Environment&rsquo;s report. I take this opportunity to thank the  Chairperson of the Committee and the other members for their detailed scrutiny  of the Bill and for the recommendations contained in their report. I am glad to  say that I was able to take those recommendations forward as amendments at  Consideration Stage. I also thank Members for their very helpful contributions  to the debates on the Bill throughout its passage in the Assembly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill is sound and effective. However, I recognise that  legislative change alone will not solve the problem of illegally deposited  waste in Northern Ireland.  The respective roles of my Department and councils in dealing with fly-tipped  waste also need to be established. Otherwise, even after the enactment of the  Bill, there will simply be confusion about who does what. Therefore, I advise  Members that my Department is consulting the local government sector on a  fly-tipping protocol, which will set out clearly the responsibilities of the  Department and councils. I also wish to reinforce previous commitments that I  gave to the Committee: I do not intend to commence the relevant provisions  until the fly-tipping protocol is in place.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, although it is clear that there is further  work to be done, I believe that the Bill will build on previous legislative  provision to help to combat the serious problem of illegal waste activity in Northern Ireland.  I commend the Waste and Contaminated   Land (Amendment) Bill to  the House.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for the Environment (Mr Boylan)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a  LeasCheann Comhairle. On behalf of the Committee for the Environment, I welcome  the Final Stage of the Waste and Contaminated   Land (Amendment) Bill.  The process has taken a long time to get to this point, but, hopefully, the  Bill will prove fruitful for the Department and, most importantly, for the  people of the North of Ireland, when it goes on to the statute books and is  implemented.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On behalf of the Committee, I wish to thank the  departmental officials and the Minister for the close working relationship that  we maintained throughout the passage of the Bill. That helped in no small way  to ensure that we reached a successful conclusion. I also thank the Committee  staff, who worked tirelessly on the Bill. Having looked at the Committee&rsquo;s  entire legislative programme for the current session, I am sometimes amazed  that we managed to complete anything, but with the assistance and guidance of  the staff, we achieved our goal, and I am grateful to them. I am sure that I  speak on behalf of all Committee members on that matter.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Waste and Contaminated   Land (Amendment) Bill  will, undoubtedly, contribute to the continuing work to address waste problems  in the North. I remind Members that the Committee made six recommendations  following its detailed scrutiny of the Bill, and the Minister incorporated four  of them as amendments. They related to: the level of fines for fixed-penalty  notices; the power to alter the amount of the fixed-penalty notices; the powers  of entry and investigation; and appeals against remediation notices. Those are  important aspects of the Bill and, as I indicated during Consideration Stage,  they are a clear recognition of how legislation can be enhanced for the greater  good when scrutinised in a fair and objective manner.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, it is fair to say that the Committee&rsquo;s key focus  was on the need for a partnership approach between the Department and local  councils to tackle illegal waste activity. Members, many of whom are or have  been councillors, are aware that the delegation of powers to local councils  does not always come with the commensurate increase in resources to exercise  those powers. Therefore, it was necessary that the Committee spend some time  teasing out that issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The requirement for an agreed protocol between local  councils and the Department is particularly important to the Committee. The  Committee acknowledged that such a protocol could not be addressed on the face  of the Bill, but it is of such importance and, in the Committee&rsquo;s opinion, so  fundamental to the successful implementation of the Bill, that I must refer to  it. Let me emphasise that I mean an agreed protocol and not one produced by the  Department, or that is in the interests of, or for the benefit of, the  Department. A protocol agreed between councils and the Department will have  much more resonance than one that is foisted on councils by the Department. The  Committee believes that that is part and parcel of a transparent, partnership  approach and a necessity for the delineation of responsibilities. Who does  what, and under what circumstances, is a refrain that we hear time and again,  and the Committee hopes that the protocol that is out for consultation will  ultimately address this issue and make it clear to local authorities,  representatives and most importantly citizens, just who has responsibility for  clearing up illegally dumped waste. The Committee also hopes that this will not  result in buck-passing by the Department and councils, and that a collaborative  approach can be established and maintained to enhance the prevention, clean-up  and overall enforcement of the Bill&rsquo;s provisions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Only last week, near but not in my constituency, I hasten  to add, citizens and councils were in confusion over who should address the  problem of illegally dumped turkey parts. All that citizens wanted was that the  revolting and stinking waste was removed, yet that responsibility appeared to  be being passed from pillar to post, from the NIEA (Northern Ireland  Environment Agency) to the council, with neither willing to take responsibility  for solving the problem, never mind trying to find out who had caused it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that the Bill will provide clarity in future  problems of that kind. As I said when speaking on the Bill, the Committee would  like the Minister&rsquo;s commitment that those aspects of the Bill that relate to  the enhanced waste-monitoring functions of local councils will not be enacted  until the protocol has been agreed with them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Related to the protocol is the need for guidance on a range  of issues. The Committee became aware of a lack of clarity on issues such as  the different approaches needed in handling domestic and commercial waste;  dealing with hazardous waste; waste dumped on land that is unregistered or  unoccupied; and that ever-difficult issue, landowner liability. The Committee  hopes that those issues will be addressed through clear and unambiguous  guidance or will be stated clearly in the agreed protocol.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee is confident that the Bill has the potential  to make a significant impact on how we manage illegally dumped waste. In an era  of austerity, this potential can be realised only by collaboration between  councils, relevant bodies and the Department. On behalf of the Committee, I am  pleased to support the Bill. Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  I, too, congratulate the Minister, the Department and those colleagues on the  Committee &mdash; who were there for much longer than me &mdash; in pulling the Bill  together and getting it this far. I look forward to seeing it working for the  councils.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I spent two and half hours yesterday walking around a river  in my neck of the woods where fish had been killed through another spill. We  have to get the point across to some people that they cannot pollute our  natural resources, and that those who do so will have to be punished.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, I welcome that the Bill allows us to fine people  and means that councils can issue fixed-penalty notices. As usual, there is a  &ldquo;however&rdquo;. I raised this point with the Minister at various times this week.  Councils must be given the necessary guidance on how to act quickly when  working with fixed-penalty notices so that we do not have delays and long  arguments over whether it is legally possible to do something and so that all  councils are acting in the same manner. The fly-tipping protocol is a very  clever mechanism, and I look forward to seeing it in place. I know that it will  be implemented as soon as it can be.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to talk today about the matter that I raised in my  amendment at Consideration Stage, which was on the quality of recycled waste. I  am very disappointed that the Bill&rsquo;s remaining legislative stages have occurred  so quickly after the Christmas recess. We discussed the issue of the quality of  recycled waste in Committee and decided not to proceed with the amendment.  Since then, however, we have been lobbied a bit stronger and a bit harder. From  a European point of view in particular, we need some form of recycling standard,  and we need to find a way, which must be affordable, for that standard to fit  councils. As we see in a piece on the BBC website&rsquo;s science and environment  pages, a large amount of our waste is of a low standard. As a result, instead  of going off to be recycled, it is going into landfill, which goes against  every other target that we are trying to meet. Today, therefore, I am asking  the Minister whether he will try to find some way of introducing measures that  will allow us to have standards in recycling. I fully support the rest of the  Bill and congratulate everyone on their good work.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I  thank the Minister and his officials, along with, of course, the Committee  staff, for the work that they have put into the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I support and welcome the Bill. I must confess that when Mr  Kinahan introduced in Committee the issue of the quality of recycled waste, I  was a bit blinded by it. I was not fully aware of what the issue was. However,  I subsequently took some soundings. The quality and standard of recycling done  by many of our councils &mdash; how they recycle and the huge investment that they  put into it &mdash; is probably second to none. In fact, I am sure that the Minister  could refer to the site at Magherafelt in the Mid Ulster constituency, which he  has visited.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, on foot of the information that I received from  businesses in the sector about the quality of recyclables that are provided to  them to churn out quality recycled materials, it is extremely important that we  learn from the report that emerged on 13 January and that is available on the  BBC website. If it is not fully sighted of it, a copy of the document by the  Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) has been provided to the Department. The  article on the website states that councils in Britain:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;are focusing too much on the quantity of recycling  rather than quality.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That is the very issue that Mr Kinahan raised in  Committee. The article continues:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;This is tending to produce a poor-quality stream of  recyclable material. Because of this, the lower-grade material sometimes has to  be sent to landfill&rdquo;,</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">which is becoming a self-perpetuating problem, with  increased loads going to landfill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The report states that the waste industry has to change its  culture so that the focus is not only on increasing the quality of recycled  materials but on retaining the quality and value of reusable materials. In  fact, the report goes on to say that that syndrome, as the BBC article refers  to it, is particularly acute with paper recycling. One of the main paper mills  in the UK  has been rejecting some British recycled paper because shards of glass in the  paper have been tearing the mills.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We need to see more action on the quality control of materials  that are coming to be recycled. We were not successful with the amendment,  which, in fact, was withdrawn, but the Department needs to have some sort of  oversight role to drive up standards, to ensure that recycling goes on and to  ultimately ensure that more waste does not wind up in landfill, thereby  incurring further costs for ratepayers and the rest of us.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I think that the Department has a key role to play in  driving up and helping to monitor standards. It also has a key role to play in  making sure that there is another tier of quality assurance. As we heard at the  Committee, it is not enough to leave the matter to the regulation of the  market. However, we do not need to go into that. It is not enough to get the  material on the nearest boat to China.  However, it is important that the Department, as the Department of the  Environment, drives up those standards and ensures that recyclables are there,  we have quality rather than quantity and we do not see a repeat of what has  emerged from the report of the professionals in Britain.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I support the Bill, and I thank the Minister for the time  that he has spent on it. I look forward to the full implementation of the Bill,  with those riders.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I thank the Members who participated in the debate. I will  deal with a number of the issues that arose.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The first is the implementation of the legislation in  advance of the fly-tipping protocol being put in place. I made it clear  previously that the fly-tipping protocol needs to be agreed so that it can be  put in place in conjunction with this piece of legislation. Therefore, although  we do not want to hold the legislation back, which I do not think will be  necessary, there will be an imperative to have the fly-tipping protocol agreed  so that we can move forward on that basis. Partnership between us and local  authorities is needed to ensure that waste and contaminated land is dealt with  more effectively and on a sound basis so that, in future, we can hold our heads  up high in how we do things.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The quality of recyclables was also raised. That is an area  where we should not put the cart before the horse. We have particular targets  to meet. However, I do not want just to meet those targets, I want to exceed  them, because that drives value for money. We can move to recycling 50% of  waste, and we can go beyond 50%. The gap between the material that is recycled  and that that goes to landfill is made up with energy from waste. It would be considerably  cheaper for us to maximise the amount of material that is recycled before we go  down the route of getting energy from waste.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Significant investment will be required to ensure that we  reduce the amount of material that goes to landfill, which is the least  desirable option. However, although I support getting energy from waste,  considerably more can be done in recycling. We will look to exceed the target  by a further 20% and to move it up from 50% to 60% by 2020. We are not letting  the EU guide us in this matter; we are being guided by common sense and our own  research.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The quality of recyclets will be an important issue. There  are two elements to the quality of recyclets. The first is that it will be  maximised if the public source-separate the material. The second element is  that a fairly significant quality can be achieved if the right machinery and  equipment is used to separate material that comes into a plant in a co-mingled  fashion. The market is not going to accept rubbish. It has been pointed out,  for example, that mills are refusing to accept paper that is contaminated with  glass. That type of material is of no benefit to anyone. Therefore, the market  will resolve a lot of the issues itself. If the material cannot be sold, it  does not have a value and will have to be sent to landfill. There is no point  taking in material in the first instance if there is no economic use for it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am still very keen to drive forward what we are doing in  recycling. I think that it is the right thing to do. We should be headed  towards recycling a significant quantity of material &mdash; around 60%. We need to  encourage business. If business knows that it is getting the material, it also  knows that it can invest in good quality equipment to separate and divide it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There may still be room for that source-separated material  as well. If those businesses are competitive, I have absolutely no doubt that  they will still be around, and I would very much like that to be the case.  However, it is a competitive marketplace, and rather than trying to impinge on  that, we must allow the market to find the point from which it can exercise its  own values.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the fact that the legislation has reached this  point. As Members know, my Department is responsible for about a quarter of the  legislation that will go through the House during the remainder of this  session. I will now have one less Bill to contend with. I greatly appreciate  that, as I appreciate the support of the House in bringing the Bill to this  stage.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That the Waste and Contaminated Land  (Amendment) Bill [NIA 10/09] do now pass.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading"><a name="i"></a>Commissioner for Older People Bill: Royal Assent</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I inform Members that the Commissioner for Older People Bill has  received Royal Assent. The Commissioner for Older People Act (Northern Ireland)  2011 became law on 25 January 2011.</p>

    <p class="H4StageHeading"><a name="l"></a>Energy Bill: Final Stage</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment (Mrs Foster)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That the Energy Bill [NIA 23/09] do now pass.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I said at Second Stage, the Energy Bill is intended to  update the current legislation applying to the natural gas sector in Northern Ireland  to enable that sector to benefit from the policies and legislation that have  already been successfully implemented in the electricity sector. The Bill&rsquo;s  other main purpose is to create a special administration scheme applicable to  gas and electricity sectors.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to take a few minutes to provide a brief overview of  the key provisions contained in each of the main parts of the Bill. First, the  Bill will introduce guaranteed standards of performance for gas companies, and  those will provide customers with specific, measurable, achievable, reliable,  and, indeed, timely standards to gauge the level of service being provided by  different natural gas companies. Guaranteed standards will help to create a  level playing field for customer standards and make it easier for customers to  compare competitive offers.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, the Bill will establish a criminal offence of  damage to gas plants. That will cover anyone who intentionally or recklessly  damages, or allows to be damaged, gas equipment used for conveying, storing or  supplying gas and will include, for example, tampering with a gas meter. The  Bill will also allow gas companies to disconnect premises and/or remove gas  meters when an offence has been committed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Thirdly, the Bill will make provision for deemed contracts  between gas companies and customers. Such a contract will exist between a  consumer and a gas supply company where no written or verbal agreement has been  exchanged, for example, when a change of tenancy occurs, and someone moves to a  different property. Where a contract has not been expressly agreed, a deemed  contract will provide a sound and binding basis for suppliers to supply  customers, and it will provide them with a clear basis on which to charge for  that supply.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Fourthly, the Bill will extend the powers of entry for gas  companies to enter premises where, for example, meter tampering is suspected.  At present, gas companies here are allowed access only when checking meters and  other fittings in the event of an identifiable danger to life and property,  such as a gas leak.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Fifthly, the Bill will clarify the meaning of &ldquo;store&rdquo; for  the purposes of existing gas storage provisions in the Gas (Northern Ireland)  Order 1996. The provision will clarify that, for the purpose of the Order, it  is only the operator of a gas storage facility, not the user, who stores the  gas.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A further clause relates to the appointment of meter  examiners and provides for the Utility Regulator to delegate gas meter stamping  and testing functions, as necessary, to an appropriate body that is best  equipped to perform such tasks, for example, the National Measurement Office.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, the Bill will provide for the introduction of a  special administration scheme for the natural gas and electricity industries in  Northern Ireland.  That will safeguard supplies to customers by local electricity and gas networks  in the event of company insolvency. Each provision presents a positive step  forward for the natural gas industry and its customers.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Chairman and members of the Enterprise, Trade and Investment Committee  for their careful scrutiny of the Bill, particularly their suggestions in  Committee that led to some minor amendments that helped to provide clarity. I  also thank Members generally. We had a good Second Stage debate on the Bill&rsquo;s  progress.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment (Mr A Maginness)</strong>: I thank the Minister for moving the  Final Stage of the Energy Bill. The Committee welcomes the Bill, which will  update the legislation applying to the natural gas sector and enable the  creation of a special administration regime applicable to the gas and  electricity sectors.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee considered the principles of the Bill to be:  first, to safeguard customer interests through the provision of guaranteed  standards for performance for gas licence holders; secondly, to provide a sound  and binding basis on which suppliers will supply customers where gas supplies  are taken in the absence of agreed contractual terms; thirdly, to extend the  powers of entry to premises for gas companies so that they broadly align with  the powers available to electricity companies; and fourthly, to help to ensure  the interrupted operation of gas and electricity networks through the  introduction of a special administration regime relating to network companies  that are threatened with insolvency or become insolvent.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee had concerns about the Bill&rsquo;s detail.  However, the Minister and her officials addressed most of those concerns to the  satisfaction of the Committee during Committee Stage. I thank the Minister and  her officials for their attention to the issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee, however, was not entirely satisfied that the  use of the term &ldquo;by culpable negligence&rdquo; in relation to damage to gas plant,  which was originally included in clause 10, was wholly appropriate. At  Consideration Stage on 13 December 2010, the Minister brought an alternative  proposal to the House. The proposal to replace the term &ldquo;by culpable  negligence&rdquo; with the word &ldquo;recklessly&rdquo; was accepted by the House and the  Committee.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Irrespective of any disagreement that there may have been,  I commend the Bill to the House.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>: We  have had a full and frank discussion throughout the Bill process. I am pleased  to say that the Ulster Unionist Party will support the passage of the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: I thank the Chairperson of the Committee and Mr Cree for their  support for the Bill. We had a full and frank discussion about some of the  issues that came before the Committee, particularly on the topic of  &ldquo;recklessly&rdquo; versus &ldquo;by culpable negligence&rdquo; and what have you. We came to a  good place on that issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill brings the natural gas industry up to date with  the other industries, including electricity, and puts in place the special  administration scheme for gas and electricity. I commend the Bill to the House  and look forward to support across the Chamber.</p>

    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That the Energy Bill [NIA 23/09] do now pass.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Members may take their ease for a couple of minutes.</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading"><a name="m"></a>Safeguarding Board Bill</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Final Stage</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr McGimpsey)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That the Safeguarding Board Bill [NIA 25/09] do now  pass.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am pleased that this important Bill has reached its Final  Stage. I introduced it to the Assembly on 8 June 2010, and I believe that the  subsequent process of discussions and debate has been extremely productive. I  thank the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety and other  Members for their careful and detailed scrutiny of the Bill. I will briefly  reiterate its main purpose and aims.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Safeguarding Board Bill will provide a legislative  framework for the creation of a new safeguarding board for Northern Ireland,  with a safeguarding panel in each of the five health and social care trust  areas. That arrangement will, for the first time, bring key agencies from  voluntary and statutory sectors together on a statutory basis to safeguard  children and promote their welfare.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill provided me with a valuable opportunity to create  a more cohesive approach to safeguarding children in Northern Ireland. The Bill will  strengthen current arrangements by introducing a statutory duty to co-operate  across all agencies involved with children and families and a duty to make  arrangements to safeguard and promote the welfare of children.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill also supports a wider safeguarding agenda, which  includes prevention and early intervention. It is also about acknowledging and  understanding that protecting children is often about helping to address the  needs and problems of vulnerable adults and parents whose ability to care for  their children has been compromised.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The safeguarding of all children cannot be guaranteed, but  a long term, continuous, collective effort is needed. The establishment of the  safeguarding board will bring the required change of thinking, practice and  culture that will ensure that agencies that work with children and families  more effectively discharge their responsibilities to safeguard and promote the  welfare of children and to work together to improve outcomes for them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is the responsibility of society, communities and  individuals to do everything possible to protect the most vulnerable,  especially children. When talking about protecting children, it is only right  to acknowledge the hard work and dedication of professionals from the range of  organisations involved in their safeguarding. It is not Ministers or MLAs who  will make quality judgements about the most appropriate intervention that will  make the greatest difference to the life chances of a vulnerable child where  such intervention is deemed necessary; it is the professionals at the front  line who are properly trained, resourced and motivated. We owe a great debt of  gratitude to all those professionals who work to protect children from abuse.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am very encouraged by the level of consensus that the  Bill has enjoyed in the Health Committee and in the House. In addition to the  widespread acceptance of the principles of the legislation, there has been a  detailed and rigorous scrutiny of its clauses. I thank the Chairperson and  members of the Health Committee for their extensive and considered  evidence-taking. I also thank those who provided written and oral evidence to  the Committee. That resulted in helpful suggestions for amendments and a  comprehensive report that was published by the Committee on 25 November 2010. I  also wish to convey my thanks to Members for their valuable input and comments  during the various stages of the Bill, and to the various agency  representatives on the SBNI stakeholder reference group, whose contribution has  helped to shape this legislation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I look forward to giving effect to the legislation and  establishing the SBNI. The new arrangements are an important step forward, and  we should seek to use this important opportunity to build on the best and look  to the future. The safeguarding board will operate in a challenging environment  that will require member agencies to work together against a background of  diminishing investment and competing priorities to deliver a brighter and safer  future for all our children.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee for Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mrs  O&rsquo;Neill)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. On behalf of the  Committee, I welcome the Final Stage of the Bill. The Bill is timely and  welcome. Having looked closely at it and what it has to offer, the Committee is  confident that it will take us a significant step forward in strengthening  safeguarding arrangements and hence protecting our children and young people.  It will do that by placing a fundamentally important part of child protection  and its workings on a statutory footing through the creation of a safeguarding  board, the SBNI.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The purpose of the safeguarding board is to co-ordinate and  ensure the effectiveness of all organisations that are involved with children  and to promote the welfare of children. It will replace a number of structures  that were previously known as the area child protection committees. It appears  that those committees, although well meaning, had no real teeth or focus. Their  lack of legislative basis meant that they sometimes struggled to move forward.  The Bill will obviously correct that situation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill has been significantly improved and strengthened  because of the amendments that the Health Committee persuaded the Department to  make. The Committee&rsquo;s detailed scrutiny led to it recommending that the  Department amend 10 of the 17 clauses. I thank the Minister for the  co-operative approach, which he recognised in his contribution, and for taking  on board the Committee&rsquo;s recommendations.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A number of the amendments that were made deserve  particular mention because of their importance to the Bill. An amendment was  made to clause 3(7), which concerns communication between the safeguarding  board and children and young people. This was an issue on which the Committee  received many representations. The majority of stakeholders, particularly the  children&rsquo;s charities, were concerned that the clause was originally drafted in  too weak a fashion and did not go far enough to ensure that consultation with  children and young people will take place in a meaningful way. To some extent,  the Committee was reassured by the Department&rsquo;s explanation that it will draft  detailed regulations that set out how the SBNI must consult with children and  young people. However, we still wish to see the wording strengthened on the  face of the Bill. After much discussion, the Department agreed to remove the  phrase &ldquo;take reasonable steps to&rdquo;, and the Committee believes that that  amendment significantly shores up clause 3.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Another important amendment was to clause 3(9)(c), which  deals with publications of the SBNI. The clause caused serious concern for many  of the groups that the Committee heard from, including Children in Northern  Ireland, the Parents Advice Centre, the NSPCC, the Children&rsquo;s Commissioner,  Barnardo&rsquo;s and others. There was a fear that it could be used by the Department  to have a potential veto on the SBNI&rsquo;s functioning and independence and to  suppress critical reports. After much discussion, the Department agreed to  amend clause 3(9)(c) as proposed by the Committee by using the term  &ldquo;consultation&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;approval&rdquo;. That is a significant change to the  Bill, and it will ensure public confidence in the SBNI&rsquo;s independence and  ability to take on the role of being a critical friend to the Department.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee is delighted to see the Bill come to its  Final Stage. The protection of children is everyone&rsquo;s business, and the  Assembly can congratulate itself on getting this Bill onto the statute books  before the end of this mandate. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I call John McCallister.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker &mdash;<span class="Italic"> [Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That was a quick return. I congratulate the Minister on  moving the Final Stage of the Safeguarding Board Bill. It is no surprise that  the Minister has managed to successfully navigate this significant piece of  reform through the legislative process of the Assembly, but he should be  commended on his achievement. I also place on record my thanks to my Health  Committee colleagues, who have worked together very well and contributed  greatly to shaping and improving the Bill where necessary. They certainly have  an important role of scrutinising the legislation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The safety and protection of children and young people has  long been recognised by Government as an issue of paramount importance. The  Executive are breaking new ground to ensure that some of the historical abuses  that have come to light in recent years do not happen again. To that end, I  congratulate the entire Executive for agreeing to hold an inquiry into  historical institutional abuse in Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As we head into this difficult budgetary period, how we  invest in and protect our children must be a measure of the type of government  and society that we want to have in the future. Therefore, setting up a  statutory safeguarding board that is focused on interdepartmental,  inter-professional, and inter-agency co-operation, with an emphasis on  prevention and keeping children safe is a significant achievement for the Minister,  the Executive and the Assembly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In recent years in this place, we have heard much talk  about, and emphasis has been placed on, early intervention and prevention to  help children in our society and ease pressure on institutions. However,  despite much talk, very few Departments have actually delivered meaningful  change. Today, the Minister is bringing legislation before us that, when it  completes its passage, will make meaningful change to children and vulnerable  families.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The objective of the safeguarding board for Northern Ireland,  apart from securing statutory provision, will be to co-ordinate and ensure the  effectiveness of what each person or body represented on the board does to  safeguard and promote the welfare of children. The body will promote awareness  and the need to safeguard the welfare of children. It will keep under review  the adequacy and effectiveness of its member agencies and it will undertake  improvements to provide information for the safeguarding board, thus ensuring  improved outcomes.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill will improve accountability, with the Minister  reporting to the Assembly once a year. It will also give independence and added  accountability on child protection issues in Northern Ireland, which should be  welcomed strongly on all sides of the House.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Protecting the most vulnerable children is a serious  responsibility for the Minister, the Assembly and society. Therefore, I  congratulate the Minister again, and I thank colleagues on Health Committee.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  I welcome the legislation, which will shortly give statutory effect to the new  regional safeguarding board. The Minister said something that we all know:  there are no guarantees in the protection of children. Nevertheless, the  legislation has reached this stage against the backdrop of the increased number  of child abuse referrals to the authorities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A number of high-profile incidents involving injuries and,  in some cases, the deaths of young children have piled further pressure on the  hard-pressed, professional people in the health authorities who work so hard to  ensure that our children are safe. On behalf of the SDLP, I acknowledge that  work. In addition, I thank the staff for their co-operation throughout the  Bill&rsquo;s time in Committee, and, of course, I thank the many individuals who gave  evidence and the many bodies that work closely on child protection issues.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Concerns were raised at various times, particularly about  the independence of the chairperson and members of the new board. There were  also issues around the important principle of accountability. Nevertheless, the  high level of co-operation among all those involved, particularly between the  Committee and the Department, should reassure the community. When issues arose,  everybody worked positively and managed to overcome them, which got us to the  stage that we are at today, where the Bill marks a significant improvement in  the protection of vulnerable children in this community.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  On behalf of the United Community group in Stormont, I rise to support the very  important Safeguarding Board Bill. I pay tribute to the staff, the Minister and  the Committee for getting us to the Final Stage. Our children are precious and  must, at all times, be loved, nourished and protected. I, like every man and  woman here, adore our children and grandchildren. My wife and I are blessed  with four beautiful grandchildren: Matthew, Laura and Shay McCarthy and Cara  O&rsquo;Prey. At this moment, Cara O&rsquo;Prey is running around my wife&rsquo;s feet in  Kircubbin. They are all precious and priceless. I am sure that every Member  will agree with me.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Every family should welcome the Bill. This is what  devolution is about, and it is a good news story. I hope that, after the  pelting that our Minister has taken in recent times, he can get on to &lsquo;The  Stephen Nolan Show&rsquo; tomorrow and spread the good news. The Bill will protect  our children and is coming from the Assembly, of which we are all part. If  possible, let us put that story out in the morning.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I think that Frank Mitchell might  take offence at that; his show is becoming the biggest in this statelet. I  agree with Kieran; this is a good news story. We are involved in politics; one  minute it is bad, and the next minute it is good. It is good that we can have a  mature debate. I am trying to get back into the Minister&rsquo;s good books for this  week.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In all seriousness, I want to take the opportunity to thank  the officials, the Minister and the Department. The Bill could have led to  clashes between the Committee and the officials, but a mature debate took  place. The Bill generated a lot of interest and a lot of concern, and we came  to the decision based on the input from the Minister. It shows that when we  work collectively on those issues, we can come to agreement.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that we welcome the legislation, because it  is about protecting and safeguarding children and vulnerable adults and  ensuring that the proper structures are in place. The Minister always goes on  and says that he is the only one who implemented the review of public  administration (RPA). If we bring new procedures in, it is important that they  are designed to ensure that we deal with all the madness that can be out there.  Therefore, the Bill is a fundamental and positive response to the whole issue of  the safeguarding of children. It offers an opportunity to take a more regional  approach to some issues. I do not want to go into past cases, but trusts and  other groups sometimes looked only within their own silos and did not take on  board issues that could be happening up the road.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will deal with the specifics. Case management review is  provided for in the Bill, and it is important that we focus on the learning and  improvements in that regard. One of the main issues that came up was the annual  report of the SBNI. The Minister should, in his remarks at the end, outline how  he intends to take that forward. Although we want to be as open, transparent  and accountable as possible, that issue created some difficulties in the  Committee. The people who were involved with the Bill are genuine, so I do not  think that it was their intention to cover anything up. However, the more open,  honest and transparent that we are, the easier it is for us to do our job.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The work plan for the SBNI will be challenging, and we all  have a duty, role and responsibility on that. The fact that that organisation  has been set up does not mean that we can all rest on our laurels. It is about  a collective partnership. We all have an interest in ensuring that our children  are safe at all times, regardless of what they are doing in their lives. Will  the Minister confirm whether the SBNI will take a lead role on developing the  North/South work on child protection? I commend him and his Department for  taking the issue by the neck &mdash; for want of a better phrase &mdash; and running with  it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I would hate to see that we had good arrangements in place  in the North and that, because of some issues in the South, predators could  look at how they could use loopholes in the law.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We will have ongoing discussions on that, but I will end on  a positive note by saying that it is a great piece of legislation and it has  shown that collective work can and must be done with the community and  voluntary sector, with us as legislators and with the people who work at the coalface.  When we come together and put our collective shoulders to the wheel, we can  come up with the best legislation to protect all children.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety</strong>: I thank all Members who  contributed to the debate. The progress of the Bill has been assisted greatly  by informed and constructive input, both in the House and in the Committee. The  Bill&rsquo;s proposals are far-reaching and offer a real opportunity to do things  better, to promote innovation, to improve performance and accountability across  all the agencies represented and to create a renewed sharper focus on  safeguarding children. I reiterate that the Safeguarding Board Bill is not a  rebranding exercise. The establishment of a safeguarding board is a serious and  radical attempt to improve co-operation and co-ordination between all  organisations involved in safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children  and to ensure that they are performing their duties effectively. We will now  have measures designed to improve interagency co-operation on child protection  at the highest level across a range of agencies.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will comment on some of the points that were made. The  board will play an important part in North/South work. Of course, the lead  rests with the Department and the Minister through the North/South Ministerial  Council, but the board will play an important and invaluable role in promoting  child protection.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Concerns were raised about the power to issue directions  around the annual report. It is quite clear that, among other things, the  regulations will set out that the annual report must include details of any  directions that are issued by the Department and a list of reports that are  submitted to the Department for publication, including the date of submission  to the Department.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill, as it stands to be voted on by the Assembly, is a  clear example of a Minister and a Committee working together successfully with  a shared aim of improving safeguarding arrangements for children in Northern Ireland.  I will, of course, continue to work with the Committee as we make arrangements  to implement the Safeguarding Board Bill and develop the relevant regulations.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, I again thank all Members who debated the  Bill, whether in the Committee or in the House, for their helpful contributions,  considered advice and positive attitude towards this important legislation.</p>

    <p class="B3BodyText">All the amendments in this group have the endorsement of  the Executive. Members will concur with me that it is appropriate and timely to  acknowledge the contribution and resolve of John McCallister in tabling this  legislation. He said to me this morning that it has been a labour of love or  perhaps more a case of hard labour for the past three years. I indicated this  morning that it takes two years to pass legislation through the Assembly from  concept stage to Royal Assent. However, in these circumstances, it has taken  three years. In the fullness of time, I trust that the legislation, which  reflects the will of the Assembly, will be adopted.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is worth commenting that Members who put forward private  Member&rsquo;s Bills seem to be single-minded. There seems to be a single-minded  character behind people such as Dominic Bradley, Pat Ramsey, Dawn Purvis,  Daith&iacute; McKay and John McCallister, all of whom have sponsored private Member&rsquo;s  Bills in the Assembly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also want to put on record my thanks to the Committee for  Social Development, the Committee for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment and the Committee for the Environment for their scrutiny  of the Bill. In particular, I thank the Committee for Social Development, which  led on that scrutiny process. It has been extensive, exhaustive and demanding.  I know that because I get copies of the minutes of the Committee for Social  Development, and I read them. Any Minister worth their salt will try to anticipate  where their Committee is going next. I know how much time and effort was put  into and the probing nature of the Committee&rsquo;s inquiry and its consideration of  the Bill. I want to acknowledge that and to acknowledge the helpful way in  which it dealt with what turned out to be a complex and challenging  undertaking.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Caravans Bill was intended to provide security of  tenure for residential caravan owners and improve existing consumer protection  for owners of static holiday caravans. That was the concept and the impetus  behind the Bill in its original form. However, many Irish Travellers also live  on caravan sites, and many of the Bill&rsquo;s protections rightly also extend to  them. The Bill was not initially designed with Travellers particularly in mind,  and many of the amendments in this group play an important part in ensuring  that the Caravans Bill takes proper account of the somewhat different nature of  Traveller caravan sites and the somewhat different needs and character of  Travellers.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Part 1 of the Bill was designed to provide security of  tenure for those who live year round in a static residential caravan on one  site. As it stands, Part 1 applies to all residential caravan owners who are  entitled to station their caravan on a protected site for more than three  months. The amendment to clause 1 will increase that period to 12 months. That  is reflected on the Marshalled List. Amendment No 1 to clause 1 reinforces the  message that Part 1 is intended to apply only to caravan sites that are  designed for long-term residential use, such as private park-home sites and  service sites for Travellers that are provided by the Housing Executive, not  the transit and emergency halting sites provided by the Housing Executive as  temporary accommodation to support the traditional nomadic Traveller lifestyle.  Many Travellers wish to continue to follow that tradition. It is important that  that is recognised and supported with the provision of appropriate transit and  emergency halting sites. However, that does not fall within the scope and  competence of the Bill. Without the amendment, there is a danger that some  users of transit sites could seek to inappropriately claim tenure rights on  those sites, which could eventually lead to such sites being silted up and  unavailable for their original purpose and would, thereby, frustrate the  Traveller community in living out its chosen way of life. That would be  counterproductive and would, over time, stifle the free expression of  Travellers&rsquo; traditions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to remember that Travellers on transit  sites will enjoy the protections of Part 2 of the Bill, as amended, and that  all Travellers on Housing Executive sites will be protected from eviction  without due process under Part 3. I want to reassure the House about that.  Amendment No 1 has the support of a wide range of stakeholders, including the  Committee for Social Development and the Northern Ireland Human Rights  Commission.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 2 introduces new subsection (6) to clause 4.  That amendment was suggested by the Committee, and I thank it for that. The  amendment will place a duty on my Department to review the operation of the  main provisions of the Bill that relate to the residential caravan sector at  least once every five years. In order to understand what that means, I refer  Members to Parts 1 and 2 of the schedule to the Bill, which outline matters  that are relevant to those who are protected under the Bill&rsquo;s provisions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 3 is needed to ensure that full use can be  made of pitches on service sites for Travellers. It is a particularly detailed  and lengthy amendment. I refer Members to the Marshalled List. During Committee  Stage, the Housing Executive expressed concern about provisions on inheritance  of residential Traveller caravan pitches when no one is living with the caravan  owner on their death. I believe that that matter occupied and preoccupied the  Committee and others for quite a while. The Housing Executive contended that  clause 5, as drafted, could mean that, in such cases, a much needed pitch on a  service site could remain unused. The amendment would prevent that by allowing  any Traveller who inherits a caravan on a residential site to live on that  site. If that person fails to do so, there is a mechanism by which the Housing  Executive can recover the pitch. Amendment No 3 also corrects anomalies in the  Bill and allows all non-resident inheritors of residential caravans either to  sell or gift the caravan and seek to assign the residential agreement.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 11 is to clause 10 and inserts new subsection (12).  It was requested by the Northern Ireland Local Government Association. I am  happy to facilitate its wishes. The amendment will provide district councils  with powers to prosecute for offences that relate to illegal evictions from  residential caravans sites. That is a core protection for the consumer. Given  that councils have a similar role for illegal evictions in the private rented  sector, that amendment seems sensible. I have long believed that good law and  enforcements create a safety net for persons, families and communities. In that  regard, this is consistent with that approach.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment Nos 19 to 21, which are to paragraphs 4, 5 and 6  of Part 1 of the schedule to the Bill, are technical amendments. They were  recommended by the Attorney General in light of relevant case law and will  ensure that the Bill remains within the legislative competence of the Assembly.  Essentially, they replace &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; with &ldquo;proportionate in all the  circumstances&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 22 to paragraph 8 of Part 1 of the schedule  corrects a drafting oversight and ensures that commission on the sale of a  residential caravan is set at a maximum of 10%. I think that the original draft  set it at 10%. As the Bill stands, a traveller living on a Housing Executive  service site could be required to pay the Housing Executive 10% commission on  the sale of their caravan. Given the different nature of traveller sites, that  is inappropriate. Amendment No 23 to paragraph 8 of the schedule removes that  requirement.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment Nos 24 and 25 are the last amendments in the  group. They are designed to provide the Housing Executive with greater scope  when it comes to repairing or improving service sites for travellers. The  amendments, as Members can read, broaden the range of works for which the resiting  of a residential caravan can be sought through the court to include works on  site amenities and allow the site owner to seek the temporary relocation of a  caravan to another site in their ownership to facilitate, for example, major  repair works. Although both amendments apply to all residential caravan sites,  in practice they are likely to be of benefit only to the Housing Executive.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Social Development (Mr Hamilton)</strong>: Before addressing  the amendments in this group and with your indulgence, Mr Deputy Speaker, I  wish to make some general remarks. However, before I start into those and  having looked around the Chamber, may I say that I cannot believe that there  are not more Members in the Chamber? I thought that the thought of talking  about caravans and the images that that would bring to people of going on  holidays would have brought more people in here on a damp and dreary  late-January evening to put a bit of cheer into what we do here. There must be  more pressing business elsewhere.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When I was elected to this place three and a half years  ago, I never thought that I would walk away at the end of the term with such an  extensive knowledge of the intricate details of caravans and know the  difference between a protected site and an unprotected site. That information  will probably reap rewards in some pub quiz in later years. It is the sort of  detailed education that I never thought that I would receive in this place.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As the Minister has said, the Committee for Social Development  has carefully and seriously considered the Caravans Bill. As the House is  aware, Committee members have undertaken a longer than expected Committee  Stage, reflecting both the careful scrutiny of the Bill and consideration of  the wider consequences of the passage of this private Member&rsquo;s Bill into law.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank members of the Social Development Committee for  their contribution to the debate in Committee and to the content of the Bill  report. As the Minister has acknowledged, you will see the real input of the  Committee in many of the amendments that are before the House. I also place on  record the Committee&rsquo;s thanks to the sponsor of the Bill for his useful  submissions to the Committee, as a non-member of the Committee and, latterly,  as a member. I congratulate him on his success in progressing the Bill to this  stage. John will be able to testify that I was an early supporter of the Bill.  I heartily congratulate him on having the tenacity to keep at it. I am sure  that he will agree that there were many stages when he thought that the Bill  was doomed. He might refer to that later. It is a tribute to him that he has  been able to keep it going, and I look forward to its passing into law.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also thank the witnesses who provided such illuminating  written and oral submissions and the departmental officials who provided a fast  turnaround on some very detailed Committee queries. Sometimes, as we go through  various stages of the passage of Bills through the House, we forget about the  stakeholders outside the Assembly who take a lot of time to carefully consider  their input into the Bill process. Many of the amendments that are being  discussed and which will become part of the Bill when passed owe their origins  to those stakeholders and their input into the process. Without them, in many  respects, we would not be able to do this work.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">5.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Owing to the nature of the Caravans Bill, the Committee for  Social Development required input from the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment and from the  Committee for the Environment. I want to record my thanks to those Committees  for their speedy deliberations and timely contributions to the Committee Stage  of the Bill. Finally, I thank the staff of the Social Development Committee,  who facilitated formal evidence taking, clause-by-clause scrutiny and the  production of the Bill report.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will now make some general remarks about the Bill. Parts  1 and 3 give additional rights and protections to people who use their caravans  as their main or sole residence. The rights and protections in question are  generally already available to caravan owner-occupiers in the rest of the United Kingdom.  Those rights include the provision of residential agreements, the right to  quiet enjoyment of a caravan and protection from eviction or the application of  unfair contract terms.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee noted that the number of caravan  owner-occupiers in Northern    Ireland who will be affected by those parts  of the Bill is quite small, possibly about 400 individuals or families on some  four so-called protected sites. The Committee also noted testimony from caravan  site owners that residential agreements and related protection may in some  cases already be in place.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Members of the Committee and witnesses at Committee Stage  raised concerns about inappropriate management practices in the residential  caravan sector. That said, the Committee received evidence from the Trading  Standards Service that those cases were exceptional and represented a minority  experience for users. I am sure that, in later contributions, some Members,  particularly from some constituencies, will talk further about some of those  negative experiences. Following the evidence taking and after careful  consideration, what Members wanted to see was consistently good management  standards in the residential caravan sector. As a means to that end, the  Committee welcomes Parts 1 and 3 of the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As the House will recall, at Second Stage the Minister  advised that the protections in parts 1 and 3 will apply to Travellers living  in caravans on what are described as Northern Ireland Housing  Executive-serviced sites. Following the Minister&rsquo;s remarks and during Committee  Stage, the Committee considered the impact of the Bill on Travellers staying in  all types of Housing Executive caravan sites. Given the absence of any explicit  reference to Travellers in the Bill, Members were surprised to learn from the  Housing Executive that the Bill as drafted could also have important  ramifications for Travellers on Housing Executive transit and emergency holding  sites.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It became clear to the Committee that, in many regards, the  Caravans Bill is not a simple read-across from similar legislation in Great Britain.  The arrangements for the private residential caravan sector and the provision  of services and sites for Travellers differ in Northern Ireland from those in  other jurisdictions. The conundrum facing the Committee could therefore be  described as follows: first, how to improve the rights of those in the private  residential sector by bringing the law into line with the rest of the UK while  not damaging an important local tourism industry, and, secondly, how to extend  those rights and protections without placing an insupportable burden on  statutory authorities providing services and sites for Travellers wishing to  pursue a nomadic lifestyle.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee carefully considered how the Bill will affect  Travellers and concluded that the relationships between organisations,  including the Housing Executive, district councils, the Department and other  government bodies, involved in meeting Travellers&rsquo; accommodation needs are  complex and subject to conflicting pressures. The Committee sought to satisfy  itself that the Caravans Bill will not significantly alter those relationships  or pressures.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Part 2 refers to caravan owner-occupiers who use seasonal  sites. That group, who are often families with young children, enjoy  caravanning as a holiday activity and regularly return to favourite caravan  sites in some of the most beautiful parts of Northern Ireland, including the  Strangford constituency. The Bill provides some basic protections for that  group, including the provision of a statement of terms and conditions. As I  said previously, the Trading Standards Service described that sector as  generally trouble-free. That said, members of the Committee recounted certain  experiences of their constituents that supported the view that the introduction  of the new protections, along with existing consumer law, was both timely and  necessary.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As above, the question of the seasonal sector presented  another conundrum. The Committee wished to provide additional important  protections to consumers, but, again, members did not wish to disadvantage or  damage a key local industry. I think that the majority of members feel that the  Bill, with certain amendments and existing consumer legislation, will just  about set the right balance between those two important considerations.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee&rsquo;s management of those unexpected and  difficult questions shows the value of a Committee Stage and the importance of  the diligent scrutiny of members of the Social Development Committee and,  indeed, of the other Committees that I mentioned.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will conclude my general remarks. The Committee  recognises the importance of caravanning as a holiday activity for many people  and believes that the basic protections in the Bill are necessary and will  generally bring the regulation of the industry into line with the rest of the United Kingdom.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to the residential caravan sector, the  Committee also recognises that only a small number of people on privately owned  or Housing Executive sites will be affected by Parts 1 and 3 of the Bill.  Nonetheless, although the Committee views the protections that are provided as  necessary and fair, it believes that a review of the effectiveness of that part  of the Bill will be necessary in a few years&rsquo; time.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I now turn to the relevant amendments in the group.  Amendment No 1 refers to the qualifying period. As part of its consideration of  the amendments in this group, the Committee considered proposals relating to  the complete exemption of Housing Executive transit and emergency halting  Travellers&rsquo; caravan sites from the provisions of Part 1. Members noted the  Housing Executive&rsquo;s concern that the application of those provisions might lead  to a reduction in the availability of suitable pitches for Travellers wishing  to pursue a nomadic lifestyle. The Committee also noted advice from the Human  Rights Commission about the incompatibility of complete exemptions with human  rights legislation. Members noted that wide-ranging exemptions from Part 1  might wrongfully deprive Travellers of certain protections available to caravan  owner-occupiers on privately owned caravan sites.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The amendment is to balance the enhancement of the rights  of those who use caravans as their main or sole residence against the  operational difficulties facing caravan site owners. The amendment allows for  improvement in protections for residential caravan owner-occupiers to come into  effect, while the increase in the qualifying period is designed to limit the less  appropriate application of those protections.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee wanted the Bill to provide protections to  Travellers with longer-term tenancies on service sites while ensuring that  sustainable provision continued to be made for Travellers requiring short-stay  caravan pitches on transit or emergency sites. The Committee felt, therefore,  that a small increase from three months to one year of the qualifying tenancy  period was an appropriate and fair way of balancing those two important  considerations.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee accepted the assurances of the Department and  the Housing Executive that the amended Bill would not lead to a reduction in  the provision of short-stay caravan pitches for Travellers on Housing Executive  sites or to site management difficulties that might necessitate other severe  mitigating actions including widespread evictions from such sites. The  Committee also accepted departmental assurances that the risks associated with  legal challenges to the nature of tenures on transit and emergency sites were  limited. Given the departmental assertions that I have just listed, the  Committee agreed to accept the Minister&rsquo;s amendment to clause 1.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I now turn to clause 2. During its deliberations, the  Committee noted concerns raised by witnesses, both site owners and caravan  owner-occupiers in the residential sector, about the effectiveness of the  Bill&rsquo;s provisions. The Committee welcomed the provisions, which give important  protection for caravan owners who use their caravan as their main or sole  residence. However, the Committee felt that the Bill should not add  unnecessarily to the bureaucratic burden on site owners. As those provisions  are new to Northern Ireland,  members agreed that a review of the effectiveness of the provisions of Part 1  was essential. The Committee encouraged the Department to develop an amendment  that would include a statutory review less than five years after commencement.  Therefore, the Committee is happy to endorse the ministerial amendment to  clause 4 relating to a statutory review.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 3 relates to clause 5, headed &ldquo;Successors in  title&rdquo;. The Committee noted evidence from the Northern Ireland Housing  Executive that suggested that the application of the successors in title  provisions to the Housing Executive&rsquo;s Travellers&rsquo; caravan site would be  inappropriate. The Housing Executive argued that the provisions could allow  users of Traveller sites to will access to a pitch to an individual who was not  resident on the site. As a consequence, the pitch could lie vacant despite the  high demand for such Traveller accommodation. The Committee again considered  the Human Rights Commission&rsquo;s advice on the incompatibility with human rights  legislation of proposed exemptions from that provision. The Committee therefore  agreed that an appropriate approach was to accept the departmental amendment,  which would limit the application of the successors in title provisions for  Housing Executive Traveller sites.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The amendment permits the Housing Executive to apply some  restrictions to the application of a successors in title provision in respect  of access to a pitch when the inheritor is non-resident on the site in  question. The Committee felt that that was a good compromise that did not  adversely affect Travellers&rsquo; rights greatly yet allowed the Housing Executive  to continue to control provision of those sites. Consequently, the Committee  agreed to accept the Minister&rsquo;s amendment to clause 5.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I now move on to amendment No 11. The Committee received  evidence from the Northern Ireland Local Government Association and district  councils suggesting that councils should have the power to investigate and  prosecute complaints of harassment and eviction among residential caravan  owner-occupiers. The Committee felt that, as councils have responsibility for  the enforcement of other tenancy legislation, the extension of powers of  investigation and prosecution relating to harassment and eviction was  reasonable and appropriate. The Committee again encouraged the Department to  bring forward an amendment that would allow councils to undertake that role.  The Committee is, therefore, again happy to endorse the ministerial amendment,  in this case to clause 10, relating to investigations and prosecutions by  councils.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I now move on to amendment Nos 19 to 21. Following  publication of the Committee&rsquo;s report on the Caravans Bill, the Committee noted  the three very short technical amendments that had been tabled by the Minister.  It is understood that those are, as I said, technical in nature; they refer to  the termination of residential agreements and reflect recent case law in England. The  Committee indicated that it was generally happy with those amendments.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I move on to amendment No 22. The Committee noted  suggestions that the limit on the commission charged on caravan sales by  residential site owners should be either increased from 10% or based on a  market valuation of the caravan rather than on the actual price paid. At Second  Stage, some Members also suggested that commission be done away with entirely.  Some members of the Committee had quite a lot of sympathy for that suggestion.  As I indicated, Committee members want to strike a balance between helping  residents of protected caravan sites and not damaging an important local  tourist industry. With that in mind, the Committee agreed that it would not  support amendments in that regard.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee recognised that the proposed commission limit  of 10% on actual sale prices was in line with industry practice in Great Britain.  The Committee, therefore, accepted the Department&rsquo;s suggestion that the Bill be  amended to clarify that the amount of commission charged on a caravan sale  should be 10% or less of the price paid rather than always being 10%. The  Committee is, therefore, happy to endorse the ministerial amendment to the  schedule relating to a limit on commission.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment Nos 23 to 25 to Part 1 of the schedule deal with  Travellers&rsquo; commission and essential works. The Committee noted with interest  evidence from the Human Rights Commission that suggested that it would be  inappropriate for commission to be paid to the Housing Executive by Travellers  upon the sale of their caravans while on a serviced, transit or halting site.  The Committee, therefore, agreed to support the Minister&rsquo;s amendment to the  schedule to that effect.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee gave careful consideration to evidence from  the Housing Executive that suggested that further exemptions to the Bill were  required in respect of essential works to Travellers&rsquo; caravan sites. The  Housing Executive argued that the Bill should be amended to permit the Housing  Executive to relocate Travellers to other sites, rather than just other pitches  on the same site, while essential works are under way.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Housing Executive also sought amendments to indicate  that upgrades to Travellers&rsquo; amenity blocks constituted essential works, which  will allow the Housing Executive to relocate Travellers to other sites while  such works are under way. Those amendments reflect the concerns that the  Housing Executive has in respect of the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee was amenable to changes to the Bill that  would ensure that the Housing Executive was able to maintain the provision and  operational control of sites for Travellers. It is worth noting that those  amendments to the schedule affect not just Travellers&rsquo; service sites but  privately owned residential sites.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee accepted departmental advice that the  relocation provisions were unlikely to be used by private site owners and that  caravan owners could insist that the alternative site is comparable to the  original and that their caravan be returned to the original site on completion  of the essential works. The Committee, therefore, agreed to support the  Minister&rsquo;s amendments to the schedule in respect of commission on Traveller  sales and essential works.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That concludes my remarks on behalf of the Committee. I was  just giving the House a flavour of what the Committee deliberated in respect of  those clauses. I want to briefly make a couple of comments in a personal and  party capacity. First, the first group of amendments is a clear example of my  strong belief that the Committee Stage is a vital component of our legislative  process. Although the amendments before us are invariably in the name of the  Minister, many of them owe their origin to the work that the Committee has  done. The Minister has already reflected that, but it is worth putting it on  the record again that many of the amendments improve what was, essentially,  already a very good Bill. Credit is due to the Committee and to the  stakeholders who gave evidence to the Committee. That shows the strong  influence that Committees and this House can have. I am sure that you would  agree, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the Committee work that goes on here sometimes  goes unappreciated out there. Some people wonder what on earth Committees  actually do, but here is a very solid and sound example of the Committee&rsquo;s work  having an influence, a real bearing and changing legislation.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">5.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I also want to discuss amendment No 1, which will  alter the qualifying period from three to 12 months. The Bill&rsquo;s sponsor and I  were concerned when that issue first arose, because it looked as though it  could be the issue on which the Bill floundered. Thankfully, we managed to get  though that, but it looked as though the issue could have caused the entire  Bill to fall flat on its face.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I must put on record, as I did previously during a  Committee meeting, that the Housing Executive raised its concerns about the  issue with the Committee at an extremely late stage in the process, after the  Committee had completed its consultation on the Bill. The Bill&rsquo;s sponsor will,  no doubt, tell the House exactly how long the Bill has taken. The process had  been ongoing for a long time when, suddenly, the implications of the Bill&rsquo;s  being passed as drafted and the negative effect that it would have on the  Housing Executive&rsquo;s management of its Traveller sites were brought to the  attention of the Committee. No doubt, such situations happen regularly and will  happen again. However, the Committee was presented with a tale of woe about how  unworkable Traveller sites and the Housing Executive&rsquo;s work on those sites  would become. Committee members were placed in the invidious position of not  being able to go ahead with what they believed was good legislation because of  one element. Had the issue been raised at a much earlier stage, the problem  could have been overcome, and Committee members could have been saved the two  weeks of their lives that they spent debating it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Having received assurances, the Committee is now content  with amendment No 1. After hearing the initial tale of woe, the Committee was  subsequently told by the Housing Executive that amendment No 1, which changes  the qualifying period to 12 months, would not make its operation and management  of Traveller sites any different than they are today. The Committee was also  given assurances that it would be made clear to Travellers moving on to sites  that their tenancy would be time limited. We all know what happens in practice,  with transient or halting sites sometimes taking on the characteristics of  permanent sites, and we also understand why that is the case. However, as long  as it is made clear to those moving on to those sites that their tenancies are  for a limited period, we should be able to overcome some of the problems. The  Committee has been given those assurances and takes them on face value.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The first group of amendments and the part of the Bill to  which they relate, deal with a specific problem. There are a couple of  protected sites in my constituency and in the constituencies of some of my  colleagues. There have been problems with those sites, and Members who have  experienced many more such problems in their areas will be able to speak much  more acutely about those.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The first group of amendments strengthen what was already  good legislation. I look forward to those being accepted by the House and  passed into law. I also look forward to those who live on protected sites  benefiting from those positive aspects of the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>:  The first group of amendments covers residential sites. I beg the Speaker&rsquo;s  indulgence for a moment to pay tribute to the Bill&rsquo;s sponsor for introducing  it. He knows that the issue is dear to me and particularly to those residents  of the Seahaven caravan park in Groomsport who were treated appallingly. The  sooner the Bill is passed, the better their protection will be.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will take each amendment separately. Amendment No 1  refers to clause 1 and clarifies to whom and for what Part 1 applies. That  amendment will change the length of time for which a caravan owner occupying a  residential site will be protected. The amendment will increase the period for  which a caravan on a site can remain an owner&rsquo;s only or main residence from  three to 12 months. I welcome that change, as it will protect caravan site  owners from those who may wish to abuse the legislation. The three-month period  was just too short a timescale.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee considered at length proposals relating to  the exemption of Northern Ireland Housing Executive Travellers&rsquo; caravan sites  from the provisions of Part 1 of the Bill. Members noted the Housing  Executive&rsquo;s concerns that the application of those provisions might lead to a  reduction in the availability of suitable pitches for Travellers who wish to  pursue a nomadic lifestyle. The Committee considered advice from the Northern  Ireland Human Rights Commission about the compatibility of such exemptions with  human rights legislation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee agreed that the Bill should provide  protections to Travellers with long-term tenancies on serviced sites while  ensuring that sustainable provision continued to be made for Travellers  requiring short-stay caravan pitches on transit and emergency sites. The  Committee, therefore, felt that a small increase from three months to one year  in the qualifying tenancy period, as suggested by the Department, was an  appropriate and fair way to balance those two important considerations. The  Committee accepted the Housing Executive&rsquo;s assurances that the amended Bill  would not lead to a reduction in the provision of short-stay caravan pitches  for Travellers on Northern Ireland Housing Executive sites or site management  difficulties that would necessitate a change in eviction policy or practice for  Travellers who stay on such sites.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee also accepted departmental assertions that  the risks associated with legal challenges to the nature of tenures on transit  and emergency sites were limited. Consequently, the Committee agreed to the  text of the amendment as proposed by the Department. Furthermore, the Committee  agreed that, as amendment No 1 adequately addressed the concerns of all  stakeholders about the Bill&rsquo;s impact on Travellers, other proposed amendments,  which would have altered the role and responsibilities of the Northern Ireland  Housing Executive in the provision of Travellers&rsquo; caravan sites were  unnecessary.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee concluded that the relationship between  organisations, including the Housing Executive, district councils, the  Department and other government bodies involved in meeting Travellers&rsquo;  accommodation needs, were complex and subject to conflicting pressures. The  Committee was satisfied that the Bill will not significantly alter those  relationships or pressures. The Committee agreed that it was content with  clause 1 as amended.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 2, to clause 4, ensures that Parts 1 and 2 of  the schedule are reviewed no later than five years after the Act comes into operation  and every five years thereafter. The amendment will provide protections for  site owners and caravan owner alike. Committee members agreed that in order to  ensure the effectiveness of the Bill, an amendment should be made that would  require the Department to undertake a formal review every five years.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 3, to clause 5, deals with successors to  titles of caravans; namely, those who have lived with a caravan owner who has  died. The Committee considered suggestions from witnesses that reassurance  should be provided to accommodate a very small number of very elderly caravan  owner-occupiers about arrangements whereby they can pass their caravan on to a  family member on their death. I welcome the amendment because it will provide  protection for caravan owners and their families.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 11 deals with the protection of caravan owners  from unlawful eviction and harassment. The Committee considered evidence from  the Northern Ireland Local Government Association and from some district  councils that suggested that councils should have the power to investigate and  to prosecute complaints of harassment and eviction made by residential caravan  owner-occupiers. The Committee felt that, as councils have responsibility for  the licensing of residential caravan sites, the extension of existing powers of  investigation and prosecution relating to complaints of harassment and eviction  was reasonable and appropriate. Therefore, the Committee agreed to put forward  the amendment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment Nos 19, 20 and 21 change the use of the word  &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; in the schedule to &ldquo;proportionate in all the circumstances&rdquo;. Those  are purely changes in the use of language. Amendment Nos 19 and 20 deal with  those aspects of the schedule that deals with the termination of an agreement  by the owner of the land.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 22 deals with the sale of caravans. It  clarifies the amount of commission paid on the sale of a caravan by removing  the phrase &ldquo;the rate of 10%&rdquo; from the schedule and inserting:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;a rate not exceeding 10% of the sale price&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Although the amendment provides clarity of  interpretation, I felt that the rate should have been set at 5%.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 23 deals with protected sites owned by the  Northern Ireland Housing Executive and relates to people from the Travelling  community. The Committee received evidence from the Northern Ireland Human  Rights Commission that suggested that it would be inappropriate for commission  to be paid to the Northern Ireland Housing Executive by Travellers on the sale  of their caravans while on a serviced, transit or emergency site. The Committee  agreed to support the Department&rsquo;s amendment to that effect.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 24 would change the wording in paragraph 10(1)  of the schedule that refers to the re-siting of a caravan. The words would be  changed from &ldquo;the protected site&rdquo; to:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;any protected site of the owner&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 25 would insert into paragraph 10(4)(a) the  words:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;or to any amenities on the site&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment Nos 24 and 25 are a response to evidence from the  Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission that indicated that proposed  amendments would not be compatible with human rights legislation. The  Committee, therefore, agreed the text of amendment Nos 24 and 25 as proposed by  the Department.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I commend all those amendments to the House.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  At the outset, let me thank Minister Attwood, his predecessor Minister Ritchie,  the Chairman of the Committee and Committee members. I was elevated to sit on  the Social Development Committee at the start of November last year. However, I  am not sure whether that was a promotion or a punishment on the part of our new  party leader.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As other Members said, this project has been bigger than I  ever envisaged. Again, as others mentioned, getting to this stage has been like  riding a roller coaster. On some days things went very well, but on others, a  phone call or an e-mail would make me realise that they were not going too well  at all.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am grateful for the support of Minister Attwood and the  Committee in dealing with all the issues that have come up. For a private  Member&rsquo;s Bill, this is a fairly significant piece of legislation. I am  encouraged by the support and warm words from all sides of the House. I will  try to lift the mood of the House, as Mr Hamilton suggested. I am surprised  that he has invited us all to a pub quiz. That shows a new DUP if that party is  heading towards doing that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As the Chairperson of the Committee said, when the issue of  Travellers first arose, the Bill was not designed either to advantage or  disadvantage them. It was not designed to affect them. However, as we got into  the Bill, we realised the value and absolute necessity of having a Committee  Stage in the Assembly, because that is where the line-by-line detailed scrutiny  is and has to be done. In a piece of legislation such as this, we can see the  value that that makes and adds to the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Chairman mentioned that the Northern Ireland Housing  Executive presented this issue to us at a late stage. Coming to us only in  September caused problems, because the Bill had been with the Committee for  some time. I am always keen, as are other members, to comply with our human  rights obligations. Indeed, we see it as a necessity. I recognise that the United Kingdom,  in European terms, does not have a very proud record in its dealings with and  treatment of the Travelling community. Therefore, when this issue came up,  amendment No 1 was the best way that we could deal with issues that the Housing  Executive raised.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At the start of this process, I did not realise that there  were so many sites or types of site. Those include protected and unprotected  sites, service sites, halting sites and emergency sites. All those issues came  up. Amendment No 1 was necessary to give the Housing Executive more time to  deal with the very real issues and pressures that it faces, and to keep the  Bill compatible with the human rights legislation. It is a very welcome  amendment, and I am grateful to the Minister and his officials in DSD who  helped to work on this and who co-ordinated it with the Housing Executive. I am  also grateful to the Human Rights Commission.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">5.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The broad thrust of the amendments is that they are either  technical in nature or improve the Bill. The Committee and the Department  worked closely to improve the Bill. I certainly support amendment No 1.  Amendment No 2 will provide for a periodic review of the legislation. It is  important that we look at the legislation after a time to see how effective it  is and what changes, if necessary, a future Assembly and a future Minister  might want to bring in to add to and to improve it if necessary.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I support and recognise the need for amendment No 3, which  deals with successors in title. It is entirely appropriate that that amendment  was tabled.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The breadth of the consultations that I, the Department and  the Committee carried out brought in NILGA&rsquo;s advice and led to amendment No 11  being tabled. The Assembly is at its best when we are working in partnership to  get the best result for our constituents &mdash; the citizens whom we serve.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As the Minister said, amendment Nos 19, 20 and 21 are of a  technical nature, and they came about very much on the advice of the Attorney  General. I am very happy to support those amendments.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 22 deals with the rate of percentage of fees.  That issue was widely debated before the Bill was even drafted, again when it  was drafted and then right through its Committee Stage. I am well aware of Mr  Easton&rsquo;s views on the matter. He shared his views with me on many different  occasions. In suggesting a rate of 5%, he drives a very hard bargain. As the  Committee Chairperson said in his contribution, the purpose of the amendment  was about finding a balance, not wanting to do any damage to the industry, and  accepting normal practice and the agreed percentage in other parts of the UK. That is why  we would be keen to support amendment No 22. Indeed, I would have tabled such  an amendment to make sure that the 10% rate was the maximum. It is an important  amendment to pass.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is entirely appropriate, under amendment No 23, that  Travellers be exempted from the percentage commission, and I do not think that  anyone can object to that. I also support amendment Nos 24 and 25.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">This has been an excellent process of scrutinising the  Bill. The amendments are broadly technical in nature and serve to improve it.  Therefore, I support the first group of amendments.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank Members for contributing to the debate on the  first group of amendments. I join a number of Members in acknowledging the work  of Committee for Social Development officials and Department for Social  Development officials. As Mr McCallister indicated, there were moments,  especially towards the end of last year, when it appeared, if only for a  moment, that the Bill was at a tipping point and was tipping out of sight  rather than being kept on the tracks. It was the diligent work of many Members,  aided by departmental and Committee officials, that kept the Bill on track.  There were dangers in the latter part of last year that we would not be standing  here today at Consideration Stage.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I should declare an interest, because my parents had a  caravan in Ballycastle. It was on a private site with no protections of any  sort whatsoever. My parents might have experienced a lack of protections. We  then moved to a great site in Cushendun that was managed by Moyle District  Council. As Members indicated about other sites, there was nothing but good and  best practice at that site in Cushendun. Legislation would not necessarily have  been required to protect the interests of the people on those sites, because  the standard of service and commitment was very high. Therefore, I have  personal and family experience of caravan sites in north Antrim.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I acknowledge the Chairperson of the Committee, who gave a  very useful and accurate narrative of the scope of the Bill. I concur with him  about the value of Committee Stage. If you look, Mr Speaker, at today&rsquo;s Order  Paper, you will see evidence &mdash; perhaps as much today as on any day in recent  times &mdash; of the Assembly&rsquo;s legislative function beginning to develop, embed  itself and mature. A number of Bills, at various stages, have been before the  Assembly today. Although that may be as a result of the rush of legislation in  the last eight weeks before purdah, it nonetheless demonstrates an Assembly  that is getting into its stride compared with heretofore.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee Stage of the Caravans Bill is a good example  of how a Committee has worked through a Bill with diligence and resilience and  got to a position where we have a high level of agreement, subject to the later  debate on many of the Bill&rsquo;s provisions. I reiterate to Mr Hamilton and Alex  Easton the reassurances that departmental officials gave about various  provisions and the potential, or otherwise, for legal challenge.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I concur with the personal comments of the Chairperson of  the Committee, Simon Hamilton, about the lateness of the Northern Ireland  Housing Executive&rsquo;s input on one or two provisions of the Bill. That represents  a wider issue, namely that public bodies in Northern Ireland are still  adjusting to the democratic interest. They are still not fully in sync with the  Northern Ireland Assembly&rsquo;s legislative authority. After all the years of  direct rule, and given the hesitancy of the first phase of devolved  Administration, public bodies have still not fully adjusted to the democratic  interest that is reflected through the Northern Ireland Assembly. There have  been some good examples of that over the past short period of time. It is  evidenced, in particular, by the process of legislation, including Committee  Stages. There seems to be a feeling that it is good enough to come in at the  eleventh hour. Well, that is not good enough. The legislative authority of the  Assembly will require increasing accountability and demands of public bodies as  we go forward. We saw an example of that at the beginning of today&rsquo;s Assembly  business with the statement on the governance and gateway review of the Housing  Executive.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also acknowledge and appreciate the comments of John  McCallister about the input of the Department and its officials in trying to  keep the Bill on track and reworking it to address the somewhat unanticipated  issues that have arisen since First Stage, which was three years ago or  something. I concur with him about all the new provisions. I am pleased to  sponsor the amendments, if you like, on behalf of the Department and the  Executive. However, that is only fulfilling the wishes, intention and good work  of the Committee. Simon Hamilton was right to make that point. I may be speaking  to and endorsing the amendments, but they are substantially a result of the  good work of the Committee, aided by officials from my Department and  elsewhere.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I conclude my remarks on the first group of amendments by  saying that the Bill is more substantial than was anticipated. However, as a  consequence of the Bill, if it gets through the final stages and receives Royal  Assent before the election, a substantial number of people &mdash; although not  everybody by any means &mdash; especially on the Traveller side will have the shield  of the law to the protect their interests around caravan and other Traveller  sites. That is a good day&rsquo;s work for the Assembly.</p>

    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: As Members will be aware, this group of amendments  addresses the parts of the Bill that relate to the holiday caravan sector.  Again, many of these amendments were suggested by the Social Development  Committee, and I again thank that Committee and the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and  Investment, which scrutinised part 2 of the Bill. I also thank Minister Foster  and her officials for their support in taking forward these amendments, which  have the Executive&rsquo;s endorsement.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The main amendment to clause 7 is designed to ensure that  all static holiday caravans enjoy the protections of part 2. The Bill, as  drafted, envisages two types of caravan site: protected sites for residential  use and, in this case, seasonal sites for holiday use. Parts 1 and 3 are  designed to protect residential caravan users on protected sites, and part 2,  which is the subject of this debate, is designed to protect static  holiday-caravan owners. During Committee Stage, trade bodies indicated that  although those distinctions are useful, they fail to take account of the small  number of static holiday-caravan owners whose caravans are pitched on protected  sites.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The result is that, as it stands, those individuals  would not enjoy any of the Bill&rsquo;s protections. It is important that all static  holiday caravan owners enjoy the protections of Part 2, regardless of the type  of site on which their caravan is pitched. For that reason, the amendment  removes the definition of a seasonal site, which means that Part 1 will protect  residential caravan owners on protected sites, and Part 2 will protect all  other static caravan owners.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">6.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The remaining ministerial amendments in this group are  consequential to the main amendment. The amendments to clause 15 are the most  significant and create a fuller definition of a protected site, which is now  needed because of the removal of the definition of a seasonal site.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive considered John McCallister&rsquo;s amendments &mdash;  amendment Nos 9, 10 and 26 &mdash; but did not reach an agreed position.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Social Development</strong>: As the House just heard, the Bill  makes provisions for caravan users who live long term on so-called protected  caravan sites. Provisions are also made for holiday caravan users on so-called  seasonal sites. However, the Bill does not recognise the fact that some holiday  caravan users take their annual seasonal break on protected sites. I am sure  that that is crystal clear. This technical quirk means that those caravan users  might not enjoy any of the Bill&rsquo;s protections. Following advice from the  Committee for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment, members became aware of the problem. The Committee for  Social Development agreed that clarity was required on the rights and  obligations of that group of caravan users. The Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment and the  Committee for Social Development agreed to encourage the Department for Social  Development to table amendments to resolve the problem. Therefore, the  Committee for Social Development is happy to support the Minister&rsquo;s amendments  to clauses 7, 8 and 15, which ensure that seasonal users on protected sites  enjoy the protections of Part 2 of the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will move on to Mr McCallister&rsquo;s amendments. The  Committee considered a proposed amendment from the Bill&rsquo;s sponsor relating to  qualifying residents&rsquo; associations in the seasonal caravan site sector. The  amendment would require site owners to communicate with a representative  residents&rsquo; association. Unlike the residential sector, site owners would not be  obliged to take account of the views of an association in respect of  significant site management issues. The Committee also considered whether the  proposed amendment should include enforcement of the provision by application  to a County Court. The matter was referred to the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and  Investment, and the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment had concerns  about the amendment, suggesting that the proposals would unnecessarily increase  the bureaucratic and regulatory burden for caravan site owners. The Committee  for Social Development divided on the issue and agreed with the Bill&rsquo;s sponsor  that the amendment should require site owners to communicate with a  representative residents&rsquo; association and for the measure to be enforced  through a County Court.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Some Committee members felt that the Bill should do more  for seasonal site caravan users. As I said earlier, that group of users amounts  to many thousands of individuals and families. On the one hand, members  recounted the adverse experiences of their constituents &mdash; perhaps the  Minister&rsquo;s family as well &mdash; and sought additional protections. On the other  hand, the Trading Standards Service advised that such adverse experiences were  not generally representative. The Committee struggled, therefore, to find a  compromise that would enhance consumer rights without disadvantaging an  important tourism industry.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As the Bill report states, the Committee certainly divided  sharply on the issue. The report also states that a small majority of Committee  members supported the Bill&rsquo;s sponsor&rsquo;s related amendments, insertions and  additions that require consultation with a qualifying residents&rsquo; association  and include enforcement by a County Court. I cannot express a Committee view on  the alteration to the Bill&rsquo;s sponsor&rsquo;s amendment as we have not discussed that  issue in Committee.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Speaking as a DUP MLA, I feel that an oversight in the  original Bill has been corrected by the amendment to that tongue-twister about  seasonal users on protected sites getting the same protections as seasonal  users on seasonal sites. I feel flummoxed as I recall that issue. I am sorry,  but try saying it after a pub quiz. I do not think that the original Bill  intended to leave those people out, and it is only right that it has been  corrected.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am divided sharply on the issue of qualifying residents&rsquo;  associations. I expressed legitimate concerns in Committee about the value of  the amendments.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Effectively, site owners would be required to consult only  before taking significant steps or measures to do with their caravan sites. The  proposed amendment would have backed that up through the ability to take action  or to seek enforcement through the County Court. However, it is not enforcement  in respect of doing what the qualifying residents&rsquo; association wants to be  done; it is enforcement only to consult on that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I stress that, although I support the amendments today, I  question the value of what is there. It is important that we see how this works  in operation. I do not think that we should build up people&rsquo;s hopes that this  may somehow revolutionise what goes on in caravan sites; what does do that is  the requirement for individual agreements. That is the most important part of  this section of the Bill, and its inclusion radically reforms and ensures the  protection of the rights of individuals, caravan site owners and those in the  seasonal sector.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I reiterate the point that the Minister made earlier: a  great many caravan site owners follow best practice anyway. I know many of  them. They do not need this legislation because they already offer contracts on  their sites and have done so down through the years. Some people take them up  on that, but many do not. Obviously, there will now be a requirement for them  to offer contracts. We are not talking about an industry that is entirely  populated by cowboys; we are talking about a few individuals who may have  behaved quite badly down through the years.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have some concerns &mdash; I have expressed them again today  and have expressed them at the Committee &mdash; about the value of the Bill  sponsor&rsquo;s amendments and whether they will involve more bureaucracy and,  indeed, more cost for caravan site owners. However, I can see that there are  positives in a sense. The Bill&rsquo;s sponsor has told the Committee that, where  there are issues on sites or have historically been issues, it may benefit the  site owner to have one point of contact so that they do not have to go round  everybody on the site. I do not think that a lot of people go off to their  caravan in the summertime so that they can become active members of a  qualifying residents&rsquo; association; in fact, I would suggest that many people go  to caravan sites to get away from residents&rsquo; associations. Having a residents&rsquo;  association that does qualify &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  Some of these issues were heavily debated at Committee Stage, and members held  different opinions on the best way to proceed. I think that there was a general  agreement that, on seasonal sites, there were cases of very poor practice in  dealing with people who had caravans. Some people go to the caravan site on the  day that it opens for the summer holidays and stay until the day it closes.  They could be on the caravan site for six or seven months of the year. Not  everybody has suffered at the hands of caravan site owners. The Member is right  that there are probably quite a number of people who run good sites &mdash; I think  that that came out at Committee Stage &mdash; but we had all received complaints of  people being threatened on sites, caravans being moved to the gate, people not  being able to sell their caravan unless it was sold to the site owner at a very  poor price and illegal evictions. There was a raft of issues.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A number of us argued the point that, whilst we were  rightly trying to strengthen the rights of people who live on permanent sites,  we also felt that we had to strengthen the rights of people who live on  seasonal sites. For many people, that is their wee oasis that they can get away  to. They should have similar protections as people on any other caravan site.  That is the argument that we were making. We believed that the residents&rsquo;  association should have had more teeth than the Bill gives it. However, John  has put a lot of hard work into the Bill, and we accept and will support that  element of it to get it through. The residents&rsquo; association, even as it is laid  out there, may give some protection to people on sites.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I know what the Member is saying about people not rushing  away to join residents&rsquo; associations. At the same time, however, many people  feel aggrieved and, under the present circumstances, they may not be allowed to  form a resident&rsquo;s association. If this legislation is enacted, they could have  a debating forum that allows them to go with some strength to try to work out  some way forward with caravan site owners.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although we support the Bill, we argue that we will come  back to this issue at some time in the future. We need to monitor it. It is  obviously up to the Minister and Department to ensure that people&rsquo;s rights,  even as they are laid out in the Bill, are protected. There was a difference of  opinion in Committee, and those are the reasons why we called for stronger  legislation.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Social Development</strong>: I thank the Member for his  intervention. Even though he went through what may be described as bad practice  in the sector, all evidence, including the number of complaints and what we  heard from the Trading Standards Service and other Members, suggests that that  is the exception. I appreciate that some site owners have behaved very badly in  the past, but that is the exception. The growth of the sector is the proof of  that exception. There would not be so many sites right across Northern Ireland  if they were all run in the way that the Member suggested.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are small numbers of unprotected sites. The first  group of amendments related to protected sites or the residential caravan  sector, but seasonal sites are the big sector. It pertains to thousands of  people right across Northern    Ireland whereas the protected sites are  perhaps limited in number and exist in only a few areas. It is right that we  have particular focus on their rights, and the Bill gives rights to those  people.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member talked about unfair terms and poor practice. I  thought that he was going to talk again about the removal of a tyre swing from  a site, which he explained in Committee. Unfair terms and shoddy and poor  practices in the past &mdash; perhaps even in the present &mdash; by some site owners will  be dealt with fundamentally by the requirement for everybody to have a  contract. That ought to deal with that conclusively, and I hope that it does.  We will see over time.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am sure that even the Bill&rsquo;s sponsor, who proposed these  amendments, hopes that the requirement for every site owner to offer every  person with a pitch a contract will deal with those problems and that there  will be no need to have residents&rsquo; associations and all of that process as  well. In fact, the legislation&rsquo;s success will be proved if we never see a case  going to a county court. I hope that that is the case. Although I have  expressed concerns about this issue before, I see positives in having one point  of contact. The Bill sponsor&rsquo;s proposed clause 8C would have had a detrimental  effect because the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment would have to  outline implied terms at a later stage through regulations. It would have been  overprescriptive in that regard.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, I do not think that anybody here ever wants  to see legal proceedings being required. As is always the case, it is an  indication that things have gone too far. I hope that what we see as a result  of the amendment is the growth of perhaps a greater understanding between site  owners and those who use their sites and that, rather than having it dressed up  as consultation, with all the formality that that implies, it just relates to a  better working relationship. At the end of the day, both parties are reliant on  each other to a greater or lesser extent. It should not be seen by some as an  opportunity to take a site owner to court willy-nilly, because, as I said, it  does not necessarily mean that they will get their way. However, I appreciate  that it protects their right to be consulted, certainly where there are major  implications for them or their site. As I said, I hope that we see the success  of this legislation in it not being used. If that is the case, I will certainly  welcome these amendments and, as I said, I hope that there is no need for them  to be used in anger in future.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">6.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>: I  will speak on the group 2 amendments, which refer to seasonal caravan sites.  Clause 7 covers any seasonal agreement made before or after the commencement of  the Bill and relates to caravan owners who are entitled to station their  caravan on a seasonal or holiday site for a period exceeding 28 days. That time  period was included to ensure that sites can be used by touring caravans or to  cover certain sites providing temporary accommodation for caravan owners or  occupiers. Amendment Nos 4 and 5 clean up clause 7 and provide more clarity.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment Nos 6, 7 and 8 remove the word &ldquo;seasonal&rdquo; and  replace it with &ldquo;caravan site&rdquo; in clause 8. Clause 8 refers to the particulars  of agreement, placing a requirement on the owners of seasonal sites to provide  caravan owners with written statements covering the terms and conditions upon  which their agreement is based. The statement must include the names and  addresses of particulars and particulars of the land on which the caravan is to  be sited, and it must set out the express terms to be contained in the  agreement. The written statement must be provided up to 28 days before a  caravan sale or pitch rental is agreed. It is intended that any express terms  of the agreement not given in writing will be unenforceable by the site owner.  The clause is intended to provide site owners with an incentive to comply with  the duty to provide a written statement and to protect occupiers from the  application of terms that have not been given in writing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment Nos 9 and 10 refer to legal proceedings for the  occupier of the site should the owner of the site fail to comply with the  specifics of any agreement as laid out in Part 2. Amendment No 16 refers to  clause 5, which deals with interpretation. Amendment No 16 deals with the  definition of &ldquo;owner&rdquo;, removing the phrase &ldquo;protected site or a seasonal site&rdquo;  and replacing it with &ldquo;caravan site&rdquo;. That provides a simpler wording, with  greater clarity about what the owner owns. Amendment No 17 refers to the  definition of a &ldquo;protected site&rdquo; under clause 15, removing the words &ldquo;seasonal  site&rdquo; and providing a more thorough and legalistic definition. Amendment No 18  links to amendment No 5, which removes the definition of &ldquo;seasonal site&rdquo; from clause  7(2). Amendment No 26 introduces a new schedule, schedule 2, which covers the  operation of a caravan owners association. I welcome the new schedule and  support all the above amendments.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>: I  will speak on group 2 of the tabled amendments, which refers to seasonal  caravan sites. Like many others here, I recognise that the seasonal sector is  the biggest sector in caravanning, because it covers those who use a caravan  occasionally, mainly in what I call, euphemistically, our summer period. Mind you,  my experience of that was being locked inside a caravan while our wonderful  liquid sunshine came down in torrents. However, it is not always like that:  when I was a youngster, I managed to get sunstroke while at the caravan on  three separate occasions, so we do not always get liquid sunshine.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 7 covers any seasonal agreement, made before or  after the commencement of the Bill, with people who use a caravan for a period  exceeding 28 days a year, and it covers the vast majority of people who use  their caravan on a summer, recreational basis. Clause 8 is important, because  it refers to the particulars of agreement, placing a requirement on the owners  of seasonal sites to provide caravan owners with written statements. I concur  with the Chairperson about the vast majority of site owners in Northern Ireland.  I recall very few incidents where there was disagreement between a site owner  and those who had a caravan on the site. The vast majority of site owners in Northern Ireland  behave responsibly, because, ultimately, it is their livelihood and business.  Nevertheless, the Bill will give added protection to those who use their  caravan occasionally, mainly during summer. Unfortunately, I recall a number of  incidents that ran contrary to the vast majority of site owners&rsquo; normal  behaviour to their tenants.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In fact, I recall that, on one occasion, an individual  handed out notices to all the tenants on his site and, basically, gave them  four weeks&rsquo; notice to get off the site because he had sold it to developers. There  was no legal comeback whatsoever on that occasion. Unfortunately, those  incidents taint the whole industry, and, for that reason and that reason alone,  I welcome clauses 7 and 8 and the other clauses in the group, which will give  added protection to those owners and give them some comeback should such  incidents ever recur. I have openly supported the Bill&rsquo;s sponsor in the past,  and I commend him for bringing it forward.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I cannot say that the Bill will affect Lagan Valley  much. We have only one caravan site, which is literally half a mile away from  my home. I do not think that it will have a massive impact on that site, which  is not huge. However, all the sites are occupied in the summer by hundreds, if  not thousands, of constituents from Lagan   Valley who travel to  their caravans. Therefore, the Bill will have an immediate impact on all those  individuals. I commend the sponsor of the Bill for bringing it forward.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I note that Lagan   Valley does not have as  much coastline as other constituencies such as South Down or Strangford. That  may be a reason why it does not have as many caravan sites. However, even Mr  Craig will acknowledge that a lot of his constituents are affected by that  because they caravan in the most beautiful constituency &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  Fermanagh and South Tyrone.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I have just been told that it is Fermanagh and South Tyrone. I thank the  Minister for bringing his amendments, and I thank the Enterprise, Trade and Investment Committee. I  know that the Chairperson of that Committee has shown great interest in the  Bill and its progress.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 4, and the technical and consequential  amendments that flow from it, is another example of how the Committee worked at  its best. A loophole was identified; there was an issue with seasonal occupiers  on protected sites, and it was important to address that issue so that they did  not lose out on the protections that the Bill was to create. That is an  important amendment, as are the technical and consequential amendments that  flow from it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to place on record my thanks to Minister Foster for  her co-operation in looking at how to address the issues in Part 2 of the Bill,  which deals with the seasonal sector, and for her co-operation in reaching  agreement on my amendments. The Chairman of the Committee spoke in his capacity  as a DUP member about his views on my amendments. My reason for proposing those  amendments was as a response to Members&rsquo; comments during the Second Stage  debate on 24 May 2010. The contributions came from Members as diverse as Mrs  Bradley and Mr Wells, and many said that we need to address the problems in the  holiday sector and that the contract will take us so far but that we need to  beef up some of the arrangements. I responded to Assembly Members&rsquo; suggestions  on other measures that we could look at to improve the legislation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I accept the Chairperson&rsquo;s remarks that the contract in  Part 2 is absolutely key to extending the rights in the holiday sector. I agree  with the Chairman that the legislation will be a success if no residents&rsquo; or  caravan owners&rsquo; group is ever formed anywhere in Northern Ireland. It will be a  success if the contract deals with that. However, I want people who holiday in Northern Ireland  in their own caravans to have that right and to have recourse to join a caravan  owners&rsquo; association and, where appropriate, to challenge the site owner. There  is strength in numbers.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It can also be useful to disseminate information. One of  the issues that trading standards has is with giving information to site owners  to disseminate around caravan parks. I compare that with asking Simon Hamilton  to give out my election literature; he may not get around every home in South  Down. I know that that is a terrible allegation to make, but he may not get to  every house in the constituency. If he wants to intervene and tell me that I am  wrong on that, he can do so.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I can see that you will be busy in April.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I think that he will help after all, and I am grateful for that.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I will take all of your literature.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I do not want to overdo his good wishes.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That is what the driving force behind my amendments &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  Certainly.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  I thank the Member for giving way. Will he assure me that the legislation that  he is proposing will not inhibit caravan park owners in the sense that they  will not be able to deal with caravan park residents who make a lot of trouble  in the area and may prove difficult not only to the park owner but to other  residents?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I am grateful to my party colleague for such an easy question. That subject  dominated the Second Stage debate. How the management of sites is balanced is a  key question. We all want that, and it came through clearly from constituents  and people who use sites and holiday at them that they do not want  troublemakers. The site owner has to have some control over who resides at a  site. However, that must be balanced with a consideration of the abuses that  some site owners inflict on their customers, which include excessive rate rises  and putting people off who are deemed to be troublemakers just because they  complain.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As with so much of legislation, this is about balancing the  rights of both groups. There is a mutual interest in that a well-run caravan  park is in everyone&rsquo;s interests. No one wants a family holiday on a caravan  site to be interrupted or destroyed by bad behaviour or antisocial behaviour.  It is vital to get that balance, and I agreed with the Chairperson that the success  of the legislation will be if residents&rsquo; groups do not need to be formed. In England, the  court upheld a group&rsquo;s objections over the management of a site, and the Office  of Fair Trading&rsquo;s guidance on sites recommends that there be some sort of caravan  owners&rsquo; association or residents&rsquo; group.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  I appreciate what Tom is saying, and in the past, a few site owners, not all,  abused their power. John is talking about getting the balance right to protect  people. It is about trying to give rights to people on caravan sites who do not  have such rights.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I am grateful to Mr McCann for his intervention, because getting that balance  is exactly what we are trying to do. That is why I brought the amendment. I  listened to the Second Stage debate and thought about how the Bill could be  improved and how some teeth could be put in to it to allow rights for caravan  owners without overstepping the balance. We have worked with the Committee and  gained Committee support, and we have worked with Minister Foster to see how it  improves that and keeps within her remit of having better regulation. That is  what we tried to achieve, and I believe that we have done so.    </p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I believe that we have achieved that. My experience  of the caravan owners&rsquo; association in my constituency is that it has moved from  being a protest group to a group where there is a very positive impact between  the site owner and the caravan owners. It has made a positive contribution to  life on the caravan park in Cranfield. It has improved to the stage that there  is co-operative working between the site owner and the caravan owners&rsquo; group,  and they have even held joint fundraisers.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">6.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Members will be aware that there was a dreadful tragedy at  Cranfield at the end of the summer. The caravan owners are looking at how they  can run an event to look at beach safety and people&rsquo;s responsibilities.  Therefore, they are trying to do something positive. This does not have to be  about a negative amendment. It is about building good relationships between  caravan owners and site owners. As we all know from our line of work, good  communication is key, and my amendment can contribute to that.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Social Development</strong>: Before the Member moves on from  that point or maybe even concludes, I want to ask whether he accepts that, if  and when this passes in the next number of moments, there is nothing that would  do any violence to site owners because of the removal of clause 8C. The Member  had discussions with the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment to ensure  that there was nothing in the Bill that would do any violence to site owners  and that would single them out for what might be described as unfair practice.  We were talking about unfair practice by site owners, but we must also consider  unfairness to site owners. Would he accept that we do not see anything here  that will do violence to site owners because of his removal of clause 8C, which  was at the request of others, including the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I am grateful to Mr Hamilton for that intervention. It was important to look at  where we could find that balance. Minister Foster made it clear that she did  not like that line, and I was grateful for her speedy reply when we put that  point to her. Hopefully, we now have the balance right, and I hope that the  whole House will agree by supporting the amendments. I am encouraged by  Members&rsquo; contributions to the debate, particularly as regards the amendment in  my name. The fact that they are receiving support all round is a positive  contribution to the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I acknowledge and thank people for their various  contributions. There are two broad points that I want to touch upon. First,  ensuring that all static holiday caravan owners enjoy the protections of Part  2, regardless of the type of site in which their caravan is located, is the  essence of the amendment. That was captured in the comments of Mr Hamilton and  Mr Craig, although they went about it in different ways.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am always heartened when I hear Members talk of radical  reform because I believe that radical reform has a positive image. The fact  that the words &ldquo;radical reform&rdquo; were uttered by Mr Hamilton reassured me,  because the amendment that widens those who are entitled to the protections of  Part 2 is, for want of a better term, a radical reform, and it scopes out the  Bill in a way that gives protections to people who are entitled to those  protections.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That point was emphasised in Mr Craig&rsquo;s contribution. He  commented on how people have had bad and bitter experiences. Even though there  is only one caravan site in his constituency, thousands of his constituents may  have caravans in other parts of Northern    Ireland, as is the case in my constituency  and in many constituencies besides. Therefore, whatever the difference may be  on Mr McCallister&rsquo;s proposals, good reform is, nonetheless, inherent in the  amendment that I have spoken to and which was touched upon by Mr Craig, Mr  Easton and Mr Hamilton.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I indicated, the Executive have been unable to agree a  position on Mr McCallister&rsquo;s amendments. However, it is necessary and it is my  duty to reflect to the Chamber the various positions that have been taken, as I  understand them. As was indicated, Mr McCallister&rsquo;s amendments fall within the  policy responsibility of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment.  Both amendments increase regulation of the holiday caravan sector by creating a  series of implied terms for seasonal agreements that are enforceable through  the courts. The implied terms that are set out in the proposed new schedule  create a requirement for site owners to recognise and consult qualifying  caravan owners&rsquo; associations on a range of issues and to give individual owners  the opportunity to go to court.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I emphasise that Minister Foster endorses the principle of  effective consultation between site owners and caravan owners. However, she  believes that those amendments are not the way to achieve that. Instead, the  Minister contends, they will create an unnecessary regulatory burden for the  holiday caravan park industry, which goes against the Executive&rsquo;s aim to remove  unnecessary regulation of industry. She is also concerned as to how compliance  with proposed requirements could be achieved effectively.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The counter-argument, which was articulated broadly by Mr  McCallister, is that his amendments will have three benefits. First, they will  create a safety net for the individual caravan owner. Secondly, they can aid  caravan owners in the better management of their sites through co-operation and  partnership, as Mr McCallister indicated in his reference to the Cranfield Caravan Park.  Moreover, in the event that a caravan site owner is on the wrong side of the  argument, a caravan association, by weight of numbers, may prevail upon that  caravan site owner to get to a better place.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Those are the two arguments, as I understand them. The  first is Minister Foster&rsquo;s argument. The second is the counter-argument, which  is captured in the three principles that I just outlined. As I indicated, the  Executive were unable to come to consensus on the matter. It, therefore, falls  to the House to determine the outcome.</p>

    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  We now come to the third group of amendments for debate. With amendment No 12,  it will be convenient to debate amendment Nos 13 to 15. Those amendments deal  with exempting certain land managed by the Housing Executive for use as a  caravan site from the requirement to have a site licence. I inform Members that  a valid petition of concern was presented on Monday 24 January in relation to  the amendments in group 3, which are amendment Nos 12, 13, 14 and 15. I remind  Members that the effect of the petition is that the vote on those amendments  will be on a cross-community basis. Members should note that amendment Nos 12  and 13 are paving amendments to amendment No 14, and amendment No 15 is  consequential to amendment No 14.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  I beg to move amendment No 12: In page 8, line 42, after &ldquo;paragraph 11&rdquo; insert  &ldquo;or 11A&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The following amendments stood on the Marshalled  List:</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">No 13: In page 8, line 43, after &ldquo;council&rdquo; insert</p>

    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">Licensing of Caravan Sites</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">Exemption from licensing of sites for Irish Traveller  community provided and managed by the Housing Executive</p>

    <p class="B3BodyText">No 15: In clause 15, page 10, line 19, leave out &ldquo;paragraph  11&rdquo; and insert &ldquo;paragraphs 11 and 11A&rdquo;. &mdash; [Mr F McCann.]</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  Before I carry on, may I say that I did not get the opportunity to commend John  McCallister and Annette Holden. Annette did a lot of work in the background.  They must be commended for bringing the Bill in its entirety to the Floor.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendment No 12 was first suggested by the Department for  Social Development. Knowing of the record of councils regarding all things  Traveller, Sinn F&eacute;in had no difficulty in supporting it. We thought that it  made sense. For the Housing Executive to have the power to bypass councils in  obtaining sites for Travellers without having to listen to anti-Traveller rants  from many councils, which would then have the licence to refuse, seemed to be  the sensible way forward.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Many councils regard Travellers as burdensome, problematic  and, in many cases, antisocial. In the past, I have listened to downright  racist comments and speeches made by councillors in a number of councils, not  least Belfast.  Even though Belfast  provides sites, the language of some members of other parties was nothing short  of insulting. Therefore, it was no surprise that the DUP tabled petition of  concern. It is obvious that the DUP has been heavily lobbied by its council  base, a number of whom are present in the Assembly. It concerns me that they  call for a protection of rights when it suits, but it is another question when  it comes to Travellers. They can make all the excuses in the world, but the  fact remains that the use of a petition of concern in this debate sends out the  wrong signals and gives cover to those in councils who would refuse to have a  Traveller site on their land.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Last night, I was browsing the Internet and came across a  history of Irish Travellers. The section dealing with racial equality and  discrimination, which focused on how Travellers in other countries are treated,  stated that opposition to Traveller sites in the North had been led by the  Democratic Unionist Party. I found that information on the Internet; those are  not my words.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">In many ways, that is my experience of attitudes,  certainly in Belfast.  The fact that a petition of concern is being used does nothing to change that  belief. Any move to remove the possibility of licences being used as a way to  stop the Housing Executive acquiring sites should be supported, and if that  means removing the power of councils to issue licences, so be it.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">6.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Paragraph 1080 of the Committee&rsquo;s report states:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The Housing Executive is planning to re-energise how  it secures sites &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  Go ahead.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>: I  thank the Member for giving way. I found what he said about the party to which  I belong fascinating. The use of a petition of concern is, quite frankly,  legitimate in this case, and we are not the only party that has ever used it. I  find it ironic &mdash; the Member should take note &mdash; that, earlier today, his party  supported an amendment, albeit to a different Bill, that ring-fenced funding  for councils. If we are to take power and authority away from those democratic  bodies, why are we ring-fencing their funding? That is what we are talking  about: the Member wants to remove responsibility from locally democratic bodies  in this country.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  I thank the Member for his intervention. Like him, I was a councillor for a  long time, some 23 years. During that period, councils across the North did  some excellent work in a number of fields. My argument is that, in a number of  councils, some of the attitudes to Travellers are still abysmal.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>:  Prove it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  I will not stand here and prove it. What I am trying to say is that you, the  DUP &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. Let us not have a debate across the Chamber.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  Sorry, Cheann Comhairle. A petition of concern was raised against what probably  should have been a simple amendment. As I was saying, paragraph 1080 of the  report states: &ldquo;The Housing Executive is planning to re-energise how it secures  sites and identifies appropriate land for sites by taking a slightly new  approach. It will do that by focusing on its landholdings and the landholdings  of other public bodies to try to identify sites that would meet the identified  and identifiable need of the Travelling community.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">To be honest, that paragraph was part of the  discussion on clause 1, but it highlights the fact that the Housing Executive&rsquo;s  pursuance of sites could extend to council land.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Many councils that have the power to grant permission for a  site would, I have no doubt, refuse to grant that licence. We in Sinn F&eacute;in  believed that it was right for the Department to make the amendment. It is  obvious that one of the DUP Ministers, whoever that may be, was unhappy about  the amendment and lobbied heavily against it. I accept that it may be a fait  accompli, but Sinn F&eacute;in believed that there was a need to debate the issue to  highlight the anti-Traveller attitudes that prevail in the Chamber.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Social Development</strong>: Although it may seem a little odd,  I will address some of the points that the Member raised later. I want to put  the Committee&rsquo;s position on the record: that will create a half-time break in  the pugilism.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">During Committee Stage, members debated a suggested departmental  amendment to remove the requirement for the Housing Executive to seek a licence  from a district council for a Traveller&rsquo;s caravan site. Some members of the  Committee supported the view expressed by the Human Rights Commission that the  existing licensing process impeded the Housing Executive&rsquo;s ability to provide  Travellers&rsquo; caravan sites and should, therefore, be amended. It was argued that  the planning process would provide sufficient controls and protections for the  establishment of new caravan sites.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It was, therefore, suggested that the Bill should remove  the requirement for the Housing Executive to obtain a district council&rsquo;s  approval for the establishment of a Travellers&rsquo; caravan site. It was argued  that that would improve the provision of new Traveller sites and would also  ease the pressure on existing sites.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Other members indicated their support for the principle of  district councils maintaining control of the licensing of Housing Executive  Traveller sites. They argued that district councils played a key role in  reflecting local concerns about the siting of Traveller and other caravan  parks. Members expressed some concern about the effectiveness of the current  planning process in that regard.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The report shows that the Committee was sharply divided on  the issue and that a small majority of members did not support related  amendments that would require council control of the licensing of Housing  Executive sites for Travellers.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Speaking in a personal and party capacity, and just to  contextualise this point, I think that everybody realises &mdash; indeed, even the  proposer of the amendments at least accepted this, in whatever way he expressed  it &mdash; that the whole issue of handling Travellers is sensitive and can often be  controversial. I do not think that anybody in the House would deny that. It is  a difficult problem to solve, and it is a problematic issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Not long after I took over this role, with the assistance  of the Federation of Housing Associations, I took a tour around housing  association developments across Northern    Ireland. One development that I visited and  that Apex Housing Association is now developing is on the Glen Road. I had two reactions to that.  As somebody from an area that would perhaps not experience the problems of  Traveller sites in a way that the Member opposite, or indeed other Members on  this side of the Chamber, could testify to, I was shocked by the conditions  that those Travellers were living in.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, I was also extremely impressed by the housing that  was being put on that site and by the work that went into ensuring that it was  appropriate for and sensitive to Travellers&rsquo; particular needs. I commend the  Housing Executive and that housing association for their work on that site. In  fact, the housing was of such a high standard that I am sure that it would be  the envy of many owner-occupiers in that area. Therefore, it is not that I do  not recognise that this is a sensitive issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also spoke in Committee about a need to deal with the  problem. However, I do not believe that the way that these amendments propose  to deal with the problem is appropriate. In the debate on the first set of  amendments, I stressed the view that the relationships between organisations  that meet Travellers&rsquo; accommodation needs &mdash; the Housing Executive, local  district councils, housing associations and other statutory agencies and bodies  &mdash; are complex and can often involve conflicting pressures. I said this at the  time, but I wanted to satisfy myself that the whole Bill, in whatever way it  went through, would not significantly alter those relationships or pressures.  That is the context from which I am coming.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I fear that this amendment proposes to shake up that  system, to imbalance that relationship, to ride roughshod over local government  and to remove a significant and important element of local input into the  process. I said in Committee, to other Members, and even to the Bill&rsquo;s sponsor,  that I feared &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Social Development</strong>: Yes, I will, before I get into  this point.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  When faced with the possibility of having Traveller sites on their land, many  councils across the North would withhold a licence or argue against having a  Traveller site on their land. When it comes down to it, very few councils end  up providing either sites or the group housing that the Member is correct in  saying is excellent. The best way to deal with that is to remove any  possibility of any council saying that Travellers are not welcome in its area.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Social Development</strong>: I thank the Member for his  intervention. My colleagues and I on this side of the House are coming to this  issue from the point of view of valuing greatly the local community&rsquo;s input  being expressed through its council.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The views that the Member expressed may have some  historical validity in some cases, and perhaps even into the future. I will  accept that. However, I value the local input that comes through local  councils. I appreciate that. I do not doubt for a second that this problem  needs to be resolved and tackled. For as long as I continue in this position, I  commit myself to do all that I can to try to resolve the problem. However, the  way to resolve it is not to say to local councils that we know that they have  problems and that we do not like that they have issues or problems, so we will  just set them completely to one side and go over their heads and do this and  that. If anyone thinks that they have problems now, such action would breed  only greater resentment and create upset in the local community, instead of  repairing some of the issues.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I accept that there are issues in society about this  matter, but doing that would only do more damage and set things back many  years. Some of the group housing projects help to try to integrate Travellers  better into the community in which they live. Setting aside the input of local  communities that, for whatever reason, are sensitive and have issues with this,  will in no way satisfactorily deal with the matter. A much better approach  would be to encourage co-operation with local government and the communities  that they represent over a period of time instead of bypassing them. That will  lead to a much more satisfactory and long-term resolution.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will go back to the point that I was trying to make  before the intervention. When he brought this private Member&rsquo;s Bill to the  House many moons ago, Mr McCallister&rsquo;s sole intention was to deal with  residential sector caravans on protected sites and seasonal sector sites. That was  his focus. He is nodding in agreement. It was nothing to do with Travellers.  Obviously, the way in which the Bill was drafted meant that it impacted on  Travellers. I have expressed some concern that some people have been &mdash; maybe  &ldquo;hijacking&rdquo; is too strong a word &mdash; trying to seize the opportunity to take the  Bill in an entirely different direction. On this occasion, I am not speaking  about the Members opposite; there are others I will point the finger at.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">This issue was not in the original Bill. It emanated from a  submission by the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission and not,  incidentally, from the Housing Executive, which is, perhaps, the body that is  the most directly affected. I said earlier that the Housing Executive came late  to the other Travellers&rsquo; issues that we talked about in the first group of  amendments &mdash; the tenancy issue &mdash; and it came late to this one as well. In fact,  and the Bill report shows this, the Housing Executive did not respond to the  Committee for Social Development&rsquo;s call for evidence. It did not submit any  evidence and it did not raise the issue of the Caravans Act (Northern Ireland)  1963, yet, as the proposer of the amendment said, it is the organisation most  affected. The Housing Executive did not raise this issue; the Human Rights  Commission, for its own reasons, raised it. The Housing Executive addressed the  issue only after the Committee, having had the issue raised with it by the  Human Rights Commission, wrote to it to encourage its representatives to come  back with evidence. Only then did the Housing Executive say that it thought  that that would be a good idea.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are three broad reasons why these amendments are  wrong, and I have given some of them. First, related to the origins of the  amendments, there has been no proper consultation on the issue. Members  received the Bill report in their pigeonholes, and it is a fairly extensive  document. There has been no consultation on this issue because of how it arose.  As I said, it arose in evidence from the Human Rights Commission, was latterly  addressed by the Housing Executive after prompting from the Committee, and was  discussed by Committee members during their deliberations. However, there was  no initial consultation by the Department, because it latched on to the issue only  as the subject of a possible amendment at a later juncture. The issue was never  included in a consultation document, and it was not consulted on in any way. It  is not the Committee&rsquo;s job to put it out for consultation in a wider sphere. I  would have thought that, on such an issue, which takes away a power from local  government, we would want to consult with local government. In looking at the  evidence in the Bill report, or indeed anywhere else, as far as I can see,  there has been no formal consultation &mdash; it may have happened informally, but  not to my knowledge &mdash; with local government, either individually with councils  that are affected by Travellers&rsquo; issues more than others or collectively  through contact with the Northern Ireland Local Government Association.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The absence of any consultation will only weaken the  relationship between local government and central government. That will happen  if members of local government see us passing amendments that affect them and  the communities that they represent without adequate, proper, or indeed any  consultation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are submissions of evidence from the likes of An  Munia Tober &mdash; I am not a fluent Irish speaker, as Members know, so I hope that  my pronunciation of that has not offended anybody. That submission addresses  other issues in the Bill that affect Travellers; it does not address this  issue.    </p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Other issues were raised by the Local Government  Partnership on Traveller Issues. I am no longer one of those awful members of  local government. However, when I was a member of Ards Borough Council we sent  two members to meetings of that partnership even though that council area was  not affected, and a member of my own party was a representative on that working  group. That partnership raised and responded to other issues, but it did not  respond to the one that was raised by the Member opposite. Therefore, we are  debating the issue today almost in a bubble and in isolation. We have spoken  about the issue in the confines of this Building, but it has never been  properly consulted on with the wider community. I stand corrected if it is  otherwise. Neither has it been consulted on with local government, which is the  sector that will be most affected by the proposed changes.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">7.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The second reason why I have deep concerns about the  amendments is their apparent inconsistency with the prevailing orthodoxy on how  we should be moving government in this society. There is a desire, which I hope  we all share, to devolve powers down to the lowest level where that is  possible, and in Northern    Ireland that is local government. There are  enough issues and potential controversies without reopening the RPA issue; it  is too late an hour and that debate is for another day. However, although we  did not ultimately execute RPA and it is being held in abeyance, the whole  principle behind it was for central government to legislate, to make policies  and to set the framework, with as much of the execution as possible being  carried out at a local level by local government. However, the proposals would  appear to move in the opposite direction and take that power away from local  government. How that power rested with local government is neither here nor  there. It was an anomaly following the moving of responsibility for Travellers  to the Housing Executive in 2003. The Housing Executive has enjoyed that power  for the better part of a decade and we should not move to take it away. I would  have thought that we would want to move more powers to local government.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Earlier today and during this Consideration Stage, the  Minister spoke about encouraging more democracy in Northern Ireland. He may have  spoken about that in an entirely different context, but I agree with his  overall sentiments. We should encourage more democratic input. The Member  opposite who moved the amendment may say that that local democratic input is  not positive. However, it is a local democratic input and involvement whether  the Member likes it or not. It may not be to the Member&rsquo;s liking or taste, but  that is democracy and we must accept the rough with the smooth. In this case,  to take away the power from the Housing Executive would be a retrograde step  and a move away from the prevailing orthodoxy that we should be handing powers  down to local government.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The third reason why I oppose the amendments and would  encourage other Members to do likewise is that amendment No 14 seeks to exempt  only Traveller sites from needing site licences. The occasions on which site  licences are not required are too intricate and impenetrable to go into, but,  by and large, they are required for most caravan sites, whether they are the  private sites such as we spoke about earlier or Traveller sites of whatever  nature or variety. As the law states currently, those licences are required to  be granted by local government. The proposal is that we exempt just Traveller  sites from the requirement. Even if I were to play devil&rsquo;s advocate and say  that I was completely supportive of the proposal, that seems to be completely  wrong. It should be all duck or no dinner, and Traveller sites and private  sites should all be exempt from site licence requirements. However, that is not  what has been proposed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The accusation has been made that me and my party are being  political with the issue. However, the proposal is also political and to put it  forward is a deliberate attempt to stir up a hornets&rsquo; nest, and I am not going  to be provoked in that way. The proposal comes from a party that frequently  talks about discrimination and calls for equality impact assessments on  absolutely everything. However, we would be discriminating against private site  owners if we were to pass the amendments. We have not quality impact assessed  that. Why not private caravan parks? Let me be frank: why is it that the  proposal is to exempt what may be described as the more controversial element  and leave out the less controversial element? To play devil&rsquo;s advocate, one  would take away the requirements for site licences for private, residential or  seasonal caravan parks. They do not tend to go to Lisburn &mdash; no disrespect to my  colleague beside me &mdash; but they do tend to go to towns and parts of the Province  where there is already a demand for caravan sites. I would have thought that  there would be less controversy if we were to take away site licences for  private owners, but that has not been included.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, this is a controversial and sensitive issue.  I commit myself to doing all that I can to resolve it, but this is not the way  to do so. This is proposing to ride roughshod over local government and  disregard local input. Whether the Member opposite likes it or not, I value the  role of councils in approving site licences. Removing that role is not without  consequence. If we live in some sort of bubble up here and think that we can  remove that power without negative consequences, we will only provoke greater  controversy, because we will not have worked with local government to come up  with a sensible solution to the Travellers issue. I encourage everyone here,  the Minister, and the Department to work to pave the way for a more amicable  solution to the problem. That is the only way to resolve it in the long term.  If we take that power away, we will be thumbing our nose at local government  and provoking them, and provoking a negative reaction in the community as well.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Other Members may want to speak in more detail about  particular issues in their constituencies. I will not do that, because those  issues do not arise in my constituency. However, that does not mean that I am  not sensitive to those concerns. I encourage greater co-operation with local  government on this issue. I will in no way encourage bypassing local  government. The amendments in question propose to do so and will do nothing to  solve the issue. They will merely move the problem and create a new problem  elsewhere. They may overcome one aspect of the problem, but they will in no way  address the sensitivities and controversies that can exist in local areas.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The use of a petition of concern may be, at an abstract  level of debating, an unsatisfactory thing to do, but it is a device that is  open to everyone in the House. I have signed petitions of concern, as have  others, on a wide range of issues. The Members on the opposite Benches have  done likewise. It is our right &mdash; if we believe that a proposal such as the one  in question will have such a negative impact &mdash; to sign the petition of concern  and present it to you, Mr Speaker. We do it because of our belief that it will  do fundamental damage to the relationship between local government and central  government and will do absolutely nothing to solve the problem. It will simply  move the problem somewhere else down the pipe. With that in mind, I encourage  Members to oppose this series of amendments in the interests of maintaining  that input from local government and, by rejecting them, encourage everyone  here to seek a more amicable and sensible solution to the problem.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  I sat on a council which, for years, has worked with Travelling people and  tried to get them settled, and somewhere decent to live, which was their  entitlement. They are no different to anyone else; they need homes. The  responsibility for looking after their interests should be transferred to the  Housing Executive. Experienced housing officers in the Housing Executive have a  better way of working with Travelling people and understand their needs. The  Chairperson of the Committee said that this should not be an issue, but the  petition of concern made it an issue tonight, and I feel very sad that this has  happened. This should have been handled in a different way. A petition of  concern does not handle this well. It has made a bad situation worse. I am  sorry, and I regret to have to say that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">These people are the same as you and me. If your council  has never worked with them &mdash; if any of you are councillors and have never  worked with them &mdash; you do not understand them and you would not understand the  work that councils put into this. Once they were transferred to the Housing  Executive. Then Apex Housing came in and built the housing sites. I invite any  of you to come and see the housing sites. They are absolutely superb. The  families that live in those housing sites now realise that they should live in  houses. This is educating them in a way of getting into houses. It is improving  their lifestyle and giving children a better way of life. Who would refuse them  that?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I cannot support the petition of concern in any way. As a  matter of fact, I am totally appalled that it even arose this evening.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: A number  of amendments have been proposed to take into account the special circumstances  of Travellers. It is such a pity that the DUP cannot bring itself to support  this group of amendments. It is such a pity that the DUP has to use the  petition of concern to try to defeat it. There are fewer than 1,500 Travellers  in Northern Ireland,  and yet we seem to have so much trouble and difficulty in accommodating their  special needs in order for them to maintain their nomadic lifestyle. Surely we  need to respect their needs and accommodate them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The lack of provision for Irish Travellers has been  criticised by national, European and international bodies such as the UN and  the Council of Europe. We have been shamed and named for not providing proper  accommodation and living conditions for families and children for so long.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A big problem, stated clearly by staff in the Housing  Executive during the evidence sessions at Committee Stage, is in securing  appropriate sites. Housing Executive staff said that they are looking at a new  approach and at making greater use of the Housing Executive&rsquo;s own land and  other public land banks to meet the accommodation needs of all people,  including Travellers. This group of amendments should help the efforts of the  Housing Executive to find more appropriate sites to accommodate the Travellers.  The amendments aim to address the anomaly that, while the Housing Executive was  given not only the power but also the responsibility of providing Travellers  with accommodation in 2003, it still has to seek site licences from local  councils. I want to ask why. Why, except political influence? Councils such as  Craigavon Borough Council have used it as a mechanism for blocking the building  of Travellers&rsquo; sites.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Human Rights Commission supports these amendments and  accordingly advised the Committee to put them in, so that we can meet human  rights obligations in Northern    Ireland. If we are going to be a progressive  society, we have to respect diversity. Minister Poots wrote to the Social  Development Minister on 4 October, giving his support for an amendment to  correct this discrepancy. It is a discrepancy to exempt the Housing Executive  from the license requirement. Mr Hamilton said that removing the power from the  councils was not democracy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Surely we have a planning system now that will give  councils plenty of opportunities if they want to object to any planning  applications. It is a shame that the DUP just cannot bring itself to support  this group of amendments.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">7.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Anderson</strong>:  I welcome the Caravans Bill and commend Mr McCallister for bringing it to the  House.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is worth reminding ourselves that the Bill was  introduced in good faith, with the aim of addressing anomalies in a range of  areas, such as rights of tenure and other rights for caravan owners.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to speak to the third group of amendments &mdash;  amendment Nos 12, 13, 14 and 15 &mdash; which deals with exemption from the licensing  of sites. I will concentrate on amendment No 14, which is being introduced as a  new substantive clause. I declare an interest as a member of Craigavon Borough  Council.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am disappointed with those who decided to table a  substantive amendment of this nature. It is completely unnecessary and  extremely unhelpful. The amendment is misplaced and misguided from a number of  perspectives. I am all too aware that there are serious issues relating to the  Irish Traveller community, as they are now known, but the Caravans Bill is not  the vehicle to use to address those issues.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In essence, amendment No 14 proposes to remove the current  requirement for site licenses, to be granted by the local council, for caravan  sites for the Irish Traveller community. As someone who joined the Committee  for Social Development last September, I would be interested to know how much  consultation took place with local authorities on the matter.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Let us consider some of the potential negative impacts of  the proposed amendment. First, as the Committee Chairperson, Mr Hamilton,  mentioned, it strikes a blow at the whole principle of equality. I find that  ironic, as the signatories to the amendment and their parties regard themselves  as champions of equality and human rights. Their amendment will create a  situation in which those who own and operate holiday caravan parks will still  be required to be licensed, whereas sites for Irish Travellers will not. One  section of the community will still be required to meet certain standards and  will continue to face the full burden of bureaucracy and responsibility. That  will not be the case for Irish Travellers. That surely cannot be morally right.  It will drive a wedge between two categories of people and, as such, is hardly  a recipe for social integration and cohesion.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, at a time when we are keen to develop local  government and enhance the role and work of councils, the amendment proposes  that we take away a very important and worthwhile function. Why would we want  to reduce council powers in that way? I argue that, by ensuring that councils  retain licensing powers on Travellers&rsquo; sites, we are ensuring that locally  elected representatives, from all the parties, are in a position to make  decisions that reflect local people&rsquo;s views. In that way, we will safeguard  Travellers&rsquo; rights on the one hand and the democratic rights and concerns of  local people on the other. We have a duty of care &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: Will  the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Anderson</strong>:  No, I will not give way. We have a duty of care to look after not only  Travellers but those living adjacent to Traveller sites. Some argue that the  planning process ensures adequate involvement by councils, but I beg to differ.  It is a factor, but the planning process in itself does not compensate for  direct council involvement. Local issues need local solutions, and the best way  in which to secure those is to retain council licensing powers. I fear that  mayhem could ensue if amendment No 14 is accepted.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In her contribution, Ms Anna Lo cited my council, Craigavon  Borough Council, saying that it was using some sort of blocking mechanism. That  is certainly not the case. I have been involved in Craigavon Borough Council  for 10 years and have witnessed the working relationships on it. I encourage  any Member to go down to see what happens in Craigavon Borough Council. I am  sure that the Minister has been down before, so perhaps he, too, will go to see  the sites there. I will speak about a specific site in a minute.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If the amendment were made, the Housing Executive would be  left with far too much responsibility; that would be grossly unfair to it and,  indeed, to the community as a whole. I will cite the example of Legahory Green  in Craigavon in my constituency. The Housing Executive application referred to  a temporary halting site, and the facilities that the Housing Executive  proposed to provide on the site were, indeed, very limited. However, as a  result of legal advice, Craigavon Borough Council considered that the  definition of a temporary halting site was incorrect and that it was more akin  to a transit site, given the duration of occupancy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The council, therefore, required the Housing Executive to  provide additional amenities such as electricity, toilet, shower, and laundry  facilities. Reference was made to the DOE design guide and to the Department  for Communities and Local Government&rsquo;s guide when setting site conditions.  Conditions also included references to the Housing Executive&rsquo;s management and  control of the site and the avoidance of nuisance conditions such as barking  dogs. I cite that as a case study to show the importance of retaining council  powers in the interests of all key parties.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As the Chairperson said, there are no easy solutions.  However, they will not be found by tampering with the Caravans Bill in the way  in which this amendment proposes. I oppose amendment No 14 and, by extension,  amendment Nos 12, 13 and 15, which are linked to it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I,  too, oppose amendment Nos 12, 13, 14 and 15. I agree that this is not the right  vehicle with which to bring in such significant changes to Traveller caravan  sites, which are a very sensitive issue in any community. There is great  potential to exacerbate the community tensions that can arise, particularly if  such a site were dropped into a community without appropriate consultation or  respect for the views of local people.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  In that short comment, the Member has outlined my whole argument. We should not  regard Travellers as problems in communities, which is the attitude of some  councils. Certain councils&rsquo; attitude to Travellers is highlighted in what the  Member just said.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I  declare an interest as a local councillor. The reason for my comments is that  there would be great concern if such sites were placed in Larne, Carrickfergus  or parts of Newtownabbey in my constituency,  where there is no tradition of a Travelling community. I would not understand  the Housing Executive or some outside body deciding to take such action.  However, if it did, there would be huge concern in the local community. Indeed,  it may exacerbate tensions. If there are difficulties &mdash; the Member used the  term &ldquo;problem&rdquo; &mdash; that need to be addressed, it is much healthier if the  council, in facing those difficulties, takes careful consideration of all the  options and identifies part of the solution, which could involve the  establishment of sites.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>:  All this revolves around councils&rsquo; powers to intervene. Some Members have  misquoted that councils have those powers under current planning regulations.  The reality is that there is a consultation process. The Minister made it clear  that, although it is a consultation process and not a devolved issue, local  councils do not have the authority to deal with the issue that they should  have.    </p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That small bit of authority on licensing is the only tool  that local councils have to deal with the issue. I am sure that the Member  agrees that that is the case and that it would be wrong to remove that one  single tool without actually giving councils the proper tools &mdash; full planning  powers &mdash; to deal with these issues.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I  thank the Member for his contribution and support what he said. I ask those who  advocate bypassing local councils on the issue whether they have consulted all  the local councillors and residents in the area in which they reside and  whether they have identified any possible sites. How would Members react were  an outside body &mdash; the Northern Ireland Housing Execuitve, which has its  headquarters in Belfast &mdash; to decide to locate such a site close to their homes  or those of their friends without proper consultation and against their wishes?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  I thank the Member for giving way. I thought that I said that I had worked for  years with a council that works with Travellers and that many other councillors  and councils in the area do the same. Every one of them is of the same opinion:  housing problems are not for councils; they are for the Housing Executive,  where the experienced people are. Campsites are no use to anyone. Families need  stable homes, and the only way that they will get them is if they are on the  Housing Executive&rsquo;s waiting list to be housed like every other human being.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I  thank the Member for her contribution. That experience will help to inform  local councillors in coming to decisions. I have to say that my experience of  that is somewhat limited, because there has not been a tradition of sites in my  part of the world. However, I am just thinking about how my constituents would  react were an outside body to override the wishes of the local council and  position a site in an area where there is no tradition of that happening and no  perceived need for it to happen. That would usurp local democracy and go  against the direction of trying to devolve more responsibility to a local  level.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  In relation to the point that the Member for Foyle Mrs Bradley made, there is  clear evidence that significant problems arise when attempts are made by the  Housing Executive to award houses to members of the Travelling community in  settled housing areas, even in well-established Housing Executive estates.  Those problems are there, and they cannot be discounted and overlooked. It is  right for the Housing Executive to make an effort to resolve those issues.  However, it creates a certain amount of tension in local communities.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I  thank the Member for that. As a member of the Environment Committee, I recall  visiting a women&rsquo;s centre in the Brownlow area of Craigavon to discuss an  environmental issue about a community garden. I remember being astonished at  the surrounding area and at the need for increased education, training and  support for the adjacent Traveller community to try to help them to better  themselves, because they certainly were not contributing to that. I would even  go as far as to say that they might have even been endangering their health and  safety through some of their practices. I am, therefore, sympathetic to trying  to give additional support and guidance. However, that is a separate issue.  Were such a site to be inappropriately located, it would actually endanger  others. It is important that we try to intervene, but that is a separate issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I strongly believe that local councils should play a role.  I hope that, down the line at some point, local planning decisions will fall to  councils and that, at that point, they will have some real say in such matters.  However, as other Members said earlier, at the minute, councils are only  consulted on planning issues. Therefore, the removal of licensing powers from  councils could cause real tensions at local levels, where local councillors and  people have seen their concerns and wishes totally ignored by big government. I  fear that that would exacerbate difficulties on the ground, and, for that  reason, I will oppose this group of amendments.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">7.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: Although I am tempted to contribute to the debate and  respond to some of the issues that were raised, given that the Executive were  not able to agree a position on amendment Nos 12 to 15, I am constrained in what  I can say. However, I confirm that amendment Nos 12 to 15 are technically  correct and would be legally effective should they be passed.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  In addressing this group of amendments, it is important to reiterate the  Chairperson&rsquo;s comments that the focus of the Bill is primarily on the  residential sector and holiday caravans. In the debate on the first group of  amendments, I accepted the fact that the United Kingdom does not have a  brilliant track record on Travellers&rsquo; rights. As a nation, we need to do more  and better. As a society in Northern    Ireland, we have a long way to go and much  work to do to develop our cohesion, sharing and integration strategy. I am  determined that issues about Travellers in this group of amendments do not  distract from the Bill, because the primary focus is on the residential and  holiday sector.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is late in the evening, and I suspect that many Members  have already decided the way in which they intend to vote. No matter how  powerful a speech I deliver &mdash; I see some sceptical looks &mdash; I doubt whether I  will change any minds. It has been a useful debate, with conflicting opinions,  about balancing the rights of Travellers. Although the Bill&rsquo;s primary focus is  not on Travellers, the amendments, and our debate on the first group of  amendments, demonstrate the Assembly&rsquo;s commitment to do what it can to help and  support Travelling communities and to ensure that the Bill, or, indeed, any  legislation, does not disadvantage Travellers. I am not convinced that the  balance would be right if we were to accept the amendments, but I place on  record the fact that I do not believe that a petition of concern is the  appropriate way to address the issues. Therefore, I will abstain in the vote.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. The debate has been an education for me,  and I do not know why I am surprised by the stout defence of councils by  councillors and ex-councillors.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I commend John McCallister for introducing the Bill, which  is certainly required. I do not think that John envisaged the complexities that  would surround the Bill. Indeed, from what we heard today, the Bill will also  be controversial.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have worked with Travellers for 30-odd years and have  been in many Travellers&rsquo; sites. Unlike some Members opposite, I feel that I am  in a position to comment on the treatment of Travellers. In my experience with  councils, including Newry and Mourne District Council, there were strong  prejudices against the Travelling community. However, those attitudes are  changing, and perhaps Mr Kennedy will comment on that at some stage. There is  now acceptance, and fair efforts have been made to integrate Travellers into  our community to the extent that Travellers&rsquo; sites no longer exist. Some sites  in our area were worse than those in the Third World.  Even in November, children had to stand under standpipes to try to wash  themselves &mdash; and people wondered why they were smelly and dirty. I would have  been the same if I had had to stand under a standpipe with a bar of soap in  November.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I support the amendments. My colleague Mr McCann commented  on the DUP&rsquo;s attitude historically. However, it was not just the attitude of  the DUP, as we found out today. Some, although perhaps not all, Ulster  Unionists had the same train of thought. As Mr McCann said, there has been  opposition to Travellers&rsquo; sites, and there seems to be a reluctance to remove  any power from councils. It must be said that they do not have very much power.  Perhaps they would have got a lot more through the RPA, and probably rightly  so. No doubt they will hold on strongly to the little power that they have at  the moment. That seems to be the trend.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Jonathan Craig intervened to mention council attitudes  towards Travellers, and he also alluded to other groups. My experience over  many years has been that there was a certain reluctance among councillors to  have much truck with voluntary groups. Again, that is an attitude that has  changed and continues to change, but, again, I am speaking from personal  experience in these matters.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Housing Executive is a statutory body. It did not come  through in the debate that it is recognised as competent. Obviously, it may not  be competent in some other areas, and we look forward to hearing about that.  However, it is a statutory body with responsibility for Travellers&rsquo; sites and  the provision of them. That responsibility has been mentioned today, and it is  important.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Simon Hamilton spoke as Chairperson of the Committee, and  he gave a comprehensive summation of the discussion and debate in Committee.  There was and continues to be a lot of consensus in the Committee, but there  are issues that we will always disagree on, and Travellers is one such issue.  Simon made three points about proper consultation. I was struck by what the  councillors stood up to say today. As Mr Anderson, Mr Beggs and Mr Craig are  councillors &mdash; although Mr Craig did not directly mention lack of consultation &mdash;  could they not find out whether there was consultation and let us know?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>:  No.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: I  am glad that the Member said that, but he was not the one who alluded to it.  With respect, the councillors who did allude to it did not give us any  information as to whether or not they were consulted.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Social Development</strong>: Is the Member seriously suggesting  that the onus and responsibility for consulting on what is put before us rests  with individual Members of this House? That would signal the development of the  very odd and novel concept that we are responsible for running out and  consulting with all and sundry in the country to find out whether they are  happy with proposals. There are processes for consultation. It is very clear &mdash;  indeed, the Member has not refuted it &mdash; that the amendments put forward by him  and others have in no way been consulted on properly or adequately.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: I  thank the Member for his intervention. With respect, I did not say whether or  not there was consultation. The point that I was trying to make is that a  number of members of the Committee are councillors and continue to be councillors.  If they were so exercised about lack of consultation, they could have raised it  as an issue. To my recollection, that was not done to any great degree. That is  a fairly straightforward and simple point, whether the Members accept it or  not. I do not expect councillors to run out and consult with one and all.  However, this issue is important, and if they were so exercised about it, they  could at least have raised it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Hamilton&rsquo;s second point was about the inconsistency of  the amendments and how they were at odds with the orthodoxy of devolving powers  to councils. RPA was also mentioned. He went on to talk about the amendments  proposing to exempt Traveller sites only. As far as I am aware, licences are  required for other sites, but the amendments talk specifically about  Travellers. I am not aware &mdash; if others are, perhaps they could enlighten me &mdash;  of there being particular problems with other sites to the extent that there  appears to be with Traveller sites in the view of some people. That is simply  my point.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member accepted that the issue of Traveller sites is  very controversial, and I do not think that anyone would argue with that.  However, it has been controversial for a long time, and the nettle should have  been grasped a long time ago. I made that point in Committee, and I will  continue to make it because there is a lack of responsibility and a lack of  people dealing with problems. Travellers are not outside our community; they  are members of it, and they should be treated with the dignity and respect that  they deserve. They are no worse than anybody else, and I do not think that they  necessarily want to be better than anybody else. That is certainly my  experience, and I will continue to argue that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mary Bradley talked about her experience of working with  Travellers; she made it clear that she is au fait with the problems that they  face daily. Anna Lo talked about the special circumstances of Travellers; she  made the point that there are fewer than 1,500 Travellers in the North. It  should be recognised that we are not dealing with a huge problem; we are not  dealing with thousands of people. We are talking about people who, for the most  part, want to be integrated into our society. The lack of provision has been  internationally criticised. Anna Lo&rsquo;s argument was very much in favour of the  amendments. She stated that councils had the opportunity to object, as was said  later about the planning system.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Sydney Anderson, as a councillor, made a stout defence of  Craigavon Borough Council. He said that he was disappointed by the amendments  as they were misplaced and misguided. However, my experience of dealing with  Craigavon Borough Council over the years in relation to Travellers is that it  was not exemplary in dealing with the problem. Perhaps that is not recognised  by Craigavon Borough Council, but it is certainly recognised by other people. I  think that the Member invited the Minister to view the sites in Craigavon. He  did not make it clear whether he meant &ldquo;sights&rdquo; or &ldquo;sites&rdquo;, but I assume that  it was a bit of both. He talked about equality and human rights and how one  section of the community requiring a licence was not morally right. He also  talked about a wedge being driven. In my experience, the wedge has been there  for a long time. That wedge is not firmly in place; it is starting to loosen a  wee bit, but a great deal of work needs to be done on it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will make just one comment about Roy Beggs: he is a  Nimby; he does not want Travellers in his back yard. Perhaps they just do not  want to go there because they realise the reception that they might get. What  the Member said today certainly does not inspire confidence in going to his  constituency.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Jonathan Craig intervened and talked about council powers.  He mentioned the consultation process in planning, so consultation entered his vocabulary  today at some stage. Mary Bradley also intervened and talked about houses being  required.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">7.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Perhaps I should elaborate on what Roy Beggs said. Although  he is a Nimby, he talked about there being no tradition of sites or perceived  need for them. Maybe that is why he is a Nimby. Maybe, Roy, you should broaden your experience and  come to see a few sites. It might give you an insight into how &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I  can honestly say that I would not wish for such a site anywhere in my  constituency: where skips are provided free by the council, but are not used;  where rubbish is being spread around widely; and where socks were stolen &mdash; I  will not go into detail, but they were used for something for which they were  not meant to be used &mdash; from the garden of a women&rsquo;s centre that tries to help  disadvantaged members of the community, and desecration occurred at the side of  the building. I can assure you that I do not want that anywhere in my  constituency.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Members should direct their remarks through the Chair.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>:  The Member said that he would like to help Travellers to better themselves. He  has a missionary zeal on which he should expand. Maybe he should go back to  Craigavon, or wherever he saw that site, and do his best. If there are such  sites in Mr Beggs&rsquo;s constituency, perhaps they are better supervised, looked  after and resourced.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In fairness, the Minister was brief, saying simply that the  amendments are technically correct. John McCallister was trying to be all  things to all men, because his Bill is a precious child to him and he did not  want to offend too many people.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  I thank the Member for allowing me to intervene. John&rsquo;s Bill is fabulous, but  it has certainly not been helped by the discussions that we have had tonight.  It is absolutely and totally incredible that, as representatives of everybody  out there, we are talking about a section of the community that is made up of  human beings who are the same as everybody else. I have them living in houses  in housing estates, and I invite any of you to go with me to see how they live  with the people and how the people appreciate living with them.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I remind the Member that the only reason we are debating this issue is because  of amendments tabled by her and others. If the Member is concerned about the  debate, perhaps now is not the time to worry about that. The time to worry was  the moment she tabled the amendments. That is the only reason why the issue is  being debated.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I am afraid that it is not my Floor to give way.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  I say to the Chairman of the Committee that we brought amendments that were  rightfully done, but I am not sure whether a petition of concern should have  been allowed this evening. It is absolutely appalling that we have come to this  situation in the Chamber. I have never felt as angry in my life as I feel  tonight.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Let me clarify: this is a valid petition of concern. Any vote in the Assembly  can attract a petition of concern. I have no role in it. I refer Members to the  Act that lays out clearly what a petition of concern is and when it can be used  in the House.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: I  thank both Members for their interventions. I am losing count. With respect to  what the Chairperson said about the amendments, I think that, apart from the  importance that we feel the amendments have, they have opened the debate to  wider issues. Although I disagree with the reason for tabling the petition of  concern, as the Speaker said, it is an instrument that can be used. We have all  used it. If Members feel strongly enough, they can use it. However, with  respect the wider debate, this debate has brought out the diverse views that  people have towards Travellers, which we need to address. At some stage, we  have to sit down and discuss the particular problem. This is not a recent  problem; it has been going on for a long time, and we need to deal with it. The  debate has been useful because it has contained a wide diversity of views, both  from people who have had, and continue to have, experience of working with  Travellers on a weekly or daily basis and from people who have absolutely no  experience and maybe need to gather some experience before they feel the need  to pontificate on issues that they should maybe admit that they do not know  that much about.</p>
