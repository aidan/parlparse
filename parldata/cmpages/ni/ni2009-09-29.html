      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The Assembly met at 10.30 am (Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr  McClarty] in the Chair).</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Members observed two minutes&rsquo; silence.</p>
      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="1"></a>Ministerial Statements</p>
      <p class="H4StageHeading">Joint Ministerial Committee &nbsp;Plenary Meeting</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I would like to inform Members that I have received notice from  the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister that the First  Minister wishes to make a statement regarding the Joint Ministerial Committee  plenary meeting.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister (Mr P Robinson)</strong>: I wish to make a statement on a meeting of the  Joint Ministerial Committee (JMC) in plenary format, held in London on 16 September, which the deputy  First Minister and I attended.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The meeting was chaired by the Rt Hon Jack Straw MP, Lord  Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice, on behalf of the Prime Minister.  The Prime Minister joined us for the latter part of the meeting. The other  participants were: the Rt Hon Alex Salmond MP MSP, the First Minister of  Scotland; Michael Russell MSP, the Scottish Minister for Culture, External  Affairs and the Constitution; the Rt Hon Rhodri Morgan AM, the First Minister  for Wales; and Ieuan Wyn Jones AM, the deputy First Minister for Wales.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Rt Hon Jim Murphy MP, the Rt Hon Peter Hain MP and the  Rt Hon Shaun Woodward MP, the Secretaries of State for Scotland, Wales  and Northern Ireland  respectively, also participated.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Rt Hon Liam Byrne MP, the Chief Secretary to the  Treasury, attended for part of the meeting to lead a discussion on the economy,  with Ian Pearson MP, the Economic Secretary, replacing him for the remainder of  the meeting.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We discussed issues of common interest, most notably the  economy and inter-Administration relations. We all committed ourselves to  regular engagement between the Administrations and agreed the need to maintain  and build on successful co-operation in tackling the challenges of economic  recovery and pandemic flu. We will continue to work together in decision-making  regarding contingency planning.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The discussion on the economy re-emphasised the need for  continued co-operation and the sharing of economic information.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It was agreed that co-operation between Her Majesty&rsquo;s  Government and the devolved Administrations in tackling the recession and  preparing for the economic recovery through the JMC and the economic summits in  Wales and Scotland had worked well and would continue.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">A number of issues relating to finance were raised,  including further public sector capital acceleration; difficulties over bank  lending, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises; and funding to  deal with swine flu. Those will be discussed further over the coming weeks and  at the next meeting of the Finance Ministers&rsquo; quadrilateral, which is scheduled  to take place in December 2009.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In the discussion on the state of relations, the positive  developments since the last plenary session, particularly in the development of  a new subcommittee, JMC(D), to deal with domestic matters, was noted. The  subcommittee has held two successful meetings to date and plans to meet again  in the coming months.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Recent recommendations on inter-Administration relations  emanating from independent reports on the workings of devolution were raised,  and it was agreed that a more detailed discussion to agree any improvements should  be held at the forthcoming JMC (Domestic) meeting. It was also noted that the  Secretary of State for Scotland  stated that HM Government would publish a formal response to the Calman  Commission report before the end of 2009.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Rounding off the meeting, the Prime Minister opened a  discussion on preparations for the G20 summit in Pittsburgh. He spoke of progress since April  in implementing the London G20 conclusions and of the continuing need to ensure  sustained international co-operation as the world economy moved to the next  phase. Each of the devolved Administrations took the opportunity to reinforce  the message about the severe budgetary pressures being faced. We also  underlined the importance of banks beginning to lend again and of the central  Government tempering any easing of fiscal stimuli in recognition that  businesses need working capital to avail of an economic upturn.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Moutray</strong>:  I thank the First Minister for his statement. Can he outline how he sees the  Joint Ministerial Committee developing in a devolved United Kingdom?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: Over the past years, the JMC has extended its remit quite  considerably. From having a JMC plenary, known as the JMC(P), we have developed  a JMC(E), which deals with European matters. I think that the JMC plenary has  met on two occasions; the JMC(E) has met on nine. We now have the JMC(D), which  will look at domestic issues and is due to meet soon. The Calman Commission  report recommends the establishment of a JMC(F) to deal with finance, and a  JMC(O), in which officials would meet together. Mr Deputy Speaker, we still  have another 21 or so letters in the alphabet to go through to add a few extra.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">If we deal with the issues that we have, we have  considerably extended inter-relations within the United Kingdom. It is a useful  setting for us to consider matters of mutual interest. Each Administration  will, of course, want to look at issues themselves; they will have their own  take on events. However, there will be matters for which there can be mutual  support and on which there can be agreement and a benefit in acting together;  that is what the JMC in its various formats will do.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. T&aacute; ceist agam don Ch&eacute;ad Aire. Can  the First Minister speak a bit more clearly about the status, purpose and remit  of the Joint Ministerial Committee? Where does it fit in the overall  architecture of governance east-west and North/South? What is the specific role  of the Joint Ministerial Committee? Who provides the secretariat and who is  entitled to attend?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: There are various formats. The Prime Minister, or someone deputed  by the Prime Minister, will chair the plenary session of the JMC. On this  occasion, it was chaired by Jack Straw, though the Prime Minister himself attended,  which shows something of the status of the event.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The meetings are held in various places, but most of the  meetings take place before a British-Irish meeting or at Westminster. The most recent meeting was held  in London in  the precincts of the Houses of Parliament. Each of the devolved Administrations  sends a team along. In most cases, it will be the First Minister and deputy  First Minister, but if there is business on the agenda which relates to a  specific Department, it is possible and likely that the devolved Administration  will bring the Minister who has that particular responsibility.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The JMC does not have a decision-making role; it cannot  make decisions for the whole of the United Kingdom. However, if the  three devolved Administrations put forward a powerful case, as we have done on  a number of issues, it becomes difficult for the central Government to resist.  In most of the issues that we raise, there is a considerable amount of common  ground among the representatives from the devolved institutions, which gives us  a platform from which to persuade and influence Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government on key  issues, and it allows us to have an input on matters to which the devolved  institutions might not normally have an input, such as the G20 summit.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I welcome the First Minister&rsquo;s statement. A lot of issues that are of  importance to a great many people in Northern Ireland, such as increased  bank lending, were discussed at the meeting. The First Minister spoke about the  pressures and the budgetary positions of the devolved Administrations. Did he  get any agreement or reassurance from Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government about increased  funding to deal with the swine flu pandemic?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: That is an issue that, separately and collectively, we have  raised with the Treasury and with the Prime Minister. The short answer is that  it is still under discussion. However, I think that we all recognise that if  there is a reserve contingency fund, it would be hard to think of any issue  that would have a greater call on it than the likes of a pandemic. Therefore we  think that there is a strong case for a call to be made to the reserve for  assistance. Some health-related matters can be planned for, and some cannot.  The Health Minister could plan to have injection needles or masks and gloves  available, but he cannot plan to have a specific vaccine in place. Therefore  there was a strong call for the Government to take responsibility for the cost  of the vaccine.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I thank the First Minister for his statement and for the focus that was put on  the economy. He said that issues of joint concern were discussed. One such  issue is the impact of climate change and the working together of  Administrations in looking at best practice in meeting targets relating to gas  emissions. Were there discussions on the green economy and the jobs that could  arise as a consequence of that?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: Climate change was not on the agenda for this meeting of the JMC,  though it was on the agenda of the previous meeting at which our Administration  confirmed that we would play our full part in assisting in the process of  meeting UK  targets, and that remains the position of the Executive.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">References were made by various Administrations to the  potential value in the green economy, but there was no specific discussion on  it.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  thank the First Minister for his statement. Following up on what Dolores Kelly  has just said, and at the risk of creating JMC (C), may I ask the First  Minister whether joint action is being taken in preparation for the UK&rsquo;s  position at the Copenhagen summit later this year? Did he, along with his  colleague, take the opportunity, on the margins of the conference, to have  discussions with Rhodri Morgan and Ieuan Wyn Jones about the specific interests  of what I will not call JMC (B), but the difficulties that we and Wales  experience from the Barnett formula &mdash; an interest that Scotland does not share  with us?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: The Copenhagen  summit was not on the agenda. However, if there are issues that specifically  relate to the devolved Administrations before such a summit is to take place,  there will be contact with the Administration, and if the Executive have to  take a position, we will bring the matter to the Executive before giving our  view to the Government.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">10.45 am</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As regards the Barnett formula, I always urge colleagues  who wish to open that particular can to apply caution. If I were reviewing the  Barnett formula, I am quite satisfied that I could present a very good case for  an enhancement of Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s share of the overall funding from  the Treasury. Unfortunately, as soon as that can of worms is opened, arguments  will be put to the United Kingdom Government that Northern   Ireland already receives an inflated share, beyond that  which is received per head of population in Scotland  or Wales.  There will always be pressures in both directions.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">At the moment, the Barnett formula is based on population  share. If the formula were to become needs-based, then Northern Ireland  would have a strong case for improving its share of funding. However, whether  that case would be sufficiently strong to occasion change is another matter  entirely.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Spratt</strong>: I  also thank the First Minister for his statement. Will he indicate the extent to  which the Northern Ireland Administration are involved in east-west  institutions? Clearly, that aspect was neglected during the last mandate, and I  am keen to know if the situation has been fully rectified.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: The east-west relationship goes beyond the meetings of the Joint  Ministerial Committee. There was a lack of balance between meetings of a  North/South nature and those of an east-west axis during the last  Administration, but that has now been addressed.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is fair to say that co-operation in those forums is not  simply a unionist thing. The other party to the JMC, the deputy First Minister,  does not go to those meetings dragging his feet. Instead, he plays a full  speaking role and contributes to debates, just as I enthusiastically attend  meetings of the North/South Ministerial Council and play a full part in those  meetings.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am quite happy that there is a good North/South  relationship, but structures did need to be built up on an east-west basis, and  we now have the JMC in its various formats, and the British-Irish Council and  the sectoral formats that fall under that. Furthermore, a more relaxed attitude  is now taken with both east-west and North/South relations, and one is now able  to lift the telephone, or have an individual conversation with an appropriate  Minister if issues arise. That is the way that it should be, so that there is  not always the need for a formality of structure: if things must be done, one  can get them done.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Anderson</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat. I also thank the First Minister for his statement. Does he  accept that on certain issues, in particular on European policy, which has been  covered in the nine meetings of the JMC(Europe),  that there are instances where the British interest is at variance with  interests here? That is particularly the case in relation to agriculture and  fisheries, and Jim Shannon, who sits on the Committee for the Office of the  First Minister and deputy First Minister (OFMDFM) with me, is very keen to  highlight the differences that we experience in those areas in comparison to England, Scotland  and Wales.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Will the First Minister assure the House that OFMDFM is  seeking to develop a working practice in the meetings of the JMC, whether in  European or plenary format, which will, when needed, allow the North to  derogate from the British position? Will he assure the House that OFMDFM is  presenting the case for farming, fisheries and other industries here directly  to Europe?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I entirely accept the argument that there is a greater emphasis  in Northern Ireland on  agriculture issues than there is in the United Kingdom as a whole. That is  why the JMC(Europe) is so important, because it affords not only Northern Ireland, but Scotland  and Wales the opportunity to influence the role played by UK representatives in Europe.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The junior Ministers, who represent us at most of the  meetings, have been able not only to deal with issues at that meeting, but to  set up meetings outside the JMC so that our case can be properly represented.  It is an important vehicle for that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The derogation will be a United Kingdom derogation and,  therefore, it is a matter of influencing Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government on those  issues and, if the case is strong, I have confidence that my colleagues will be  able to do that.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>: I  thank the First Minister for his statement. Did he have the opportunity to  discuss the Presbyterian Mutual Society, either in the plenary sitting or in  the margins of it?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: Good try. The Member will not be surprised to learn that the  Presbyterian Mutual Society was not on the agenda of the JMC. However, it is a  key issue, and I take every opportunity to discuss the Presbyterian Mutual  Society, either in the margins or in separate meetings. We have agreed a date  at the beginning of October &mdash; although I will not say exactly when in case  other Ministers have difficulty in achieving that date &mdash; to take the matter to  ministerial level. That is a response to a previous meeting that we had with  the Chief Secretary to the Treasury and others. Indeed, officials discussed the  matter in London  yesterday, so it is being dealt with actively. We are looking at possible  proposals, and I hope that when we come to the ministerial meeting at the  beginning of October, we will have a proposal that we can all support.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  Along with my colleague and other Members, I thank the Minister for his  statement. I have a question about cross-border workers, which is within the  ambit of North/South and east-west arrangements. I refer particularly to the  double taxation issue and tax credits, which are the concern of the Treasury.  The tax credits are very complicated since the tax credit offices located in Newcastle or elsewhere  else across the water say that they have nothing to do with tax credits.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Member please come to his question? This is time for a  question, not a speech.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  Will the First Minister raise that matter? Does he agree that it is unfair to  ask cross-border workers to fill in the euro:sterling exchange rate when they  complete their forms?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I am happy to look at the issue to see how it might best be  addressed. It is probably more of an issue for the British-Irish Council at one  of its sectoral meetings, rather than one for the JMC. I know that there can be  problems with cross-border working, both with double taxation and tax evasion.  A wide range of issues can be looked at, and our office will see where those  can best be addressed.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  I welcome the First Minister&rsquo;s statement. I do not apologise for returning to  the burning issue of the swine flu pandemic. Will the First Minister indicate  the views that those representing the other devolved institutions expressed on  seeking assistance from Treasury to cover the expensive costs of making the  vaccine available?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: Our Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety and the  Department of Finance and Personnel have done some work in estimating the  likely cost; I think that they believe that it will be approximately &pound;77  million. That &pound;77 million will make quite a hole in the Budget, no matter what  way we decide to handle the costs involved. The First Minister for Scotland and I  had a conversation some months ago when the issue first arose of how the matter  could be addressed. We both agreed that the three devolved institutions should  work collectively to attempt to get Treasury to recognise its responsibility as  far as the reserve is concerned.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Finance Ministers have touched on the issue at a  previous meeting. We raised it again at the meeting of the JMC. There was a  united view from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland that there had to  be a contribution from contingency funding toward dealing with the issue. The  belief of the Treasury that it can be absorbed within the devolved Administrations  is, I believe, unsustainable.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Treasury could argue that there are certain elements of  the cost that can be absorbed and dealt with, but there is no good reason to  believe that the vaccine, the need for which could not have been predicted or costed  beforehand, should be a cost to the local Administrations. That would take some  of the sting out of the cost element, but it still leaves us with a hefty bill,  and the Executive will still have to decide how we deal with the costs that are  coming our way. The Executive will start that decision-making process on  Thursday.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr McDonnell</strong>:  I thank the First Minister for his statement. I notice that he twice mentioned  bank lending to small and medium-sized businesses and the importance of banks  being able to lend again. Can he give us something of the tone of the meeting?  Were we playing hardball or softball? Was it just happy talk, or was there any  serious discussion about getting the banks moving? I am thinking in particular  of Lloyds HBOS, which is now effectively 70% owned by the Government. That firm  has a big interest here in that one of its main subsidiaries is located here.  Will the First Minister tell us if there was any serious discussion, and can he  give us any indication of where we go moving forward, and how we can get  liquidity moving again? People are coming to my office day and daily screaming  that there is no liquidity and that the banks are not providing money.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: Whatever it was, it was not &ldquo;happy talk&rdquo;. One does not have happy  talk and talk about banks and lending in the same sentence. There was a united  view &mdash; not just from the devolved Administrations but from the central  Government &mdash; on the need for the banks to step up to the plate. The deputy  First Minister and I have had a series of meetings with the four main banks,  and, indeed, with the other banks in Northern Ireland, most recently  with Barclays. The message that we get from the four main banks is that they  have never lent more; they throw out statistics to that effect.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Then, when we go to a meeting with businessmen, we get  exactly the same kind of message as the Member for South   Belfast about the difficulty in getting access to lending, the  high interest rates being charged in spite of the low interest rate that prevails,  and the significant increase in arrangement fees. I get complaints from  companies that overdrafts are being arbitrarily removed and reduced. I do not  think that all of those difficulties are being pulled out of thin air. There  are issues that the banks have to address.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">At the meeting of the JMC, we asked the Prime Minister to  use his special position, particularly in relation to RBS, of which the Ulster  Bank is a subsidiary, to ensure that there is a flow of money. Unless we get  lending moving again, the economy will still be held down. It is vital that the  banks start to lend again. I am not suggesting that they go back to where they  were &mdash; that is the very last thing that any of us want; we want to have  responsible lending &mdash; but there seems to be an attempt on the part of the banks  to hold back from lending to certain sectors, particularly in relation to  development. If they continue to hold back, they stifle the construction  industry, which has been the worst-hit part of our economy. The banks need to  free up lending, particularly in relation to land and property.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hilditch</strong>:  I thank the First Minister for his statement. On a theme similar to that of Mr  McDonnell, will the First Minister indicate what the experiences of the other  devolved Administrations are on the issue of banking?</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">11.00 am</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: It is precisely the same. As one would expect, because RBS is a  big player in Scotland, in  the same way that the Ulster Bank is one of our main banks, Scotland is  faced with exactly the same circumstances. I can understand the caution that,  in many cases, is shown by banks. In many ways, the banking industry was  responsible for the credit crunch and the recession that we now face.  Irresponsible lending practices were at the heart of those difficulties.  Lending of up to 120% on property or land does not seem to be a sensible way  forward. The banks need to start lending, and they need some form of  regulation.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I was glad that there was a sense at the G20 summit that  that matter should be taken forward on an inter&shy;national basis. It is no use  for only the United Kingdom  to have that regulation, because banking is of such an international flavour  that, if one country were to regulate on its own, it would have no impact.  Sensible regulation will take place internationally, but all Administrations  have exactly the same difficulties. The banks are a problem, and they must  start to lend in a realistic and sensible way.</p>
      <p class="H4StageHeading"><a name="2"></a>North/South Ministerial Council</p>
      <p class="H4StageHeading">Trade and Business Development Sectoral Format</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Speaker has received notice from the Minister of Enterprise,  Trade and Investment that she wishes to make a statement on the North/South  Ministerial Council (NSMC) trade and business development sectoral format  meeting.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment (Mrs Foster)</strong>: With your permission, I wish to make a statement  in compliance with section 52 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 regarding the  meeting of the North/South Ministerial Council in trade and business  development sectoral format. The meeting was held in Dublin Castle  on Wednesday 8 July 2009.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive were represented by me, in my capacity as  Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment, and by Conor Murphy, Minister for  Regional Development, in his capacity as accompanying Minister. The Irish  Government were represented by Mary Coughlan TD, Deputy Prime Minister and  Minister for Enterprise,  Trade and Employment. This statement has been agreed with Minister Murphy, and  I am making it on behalf of both of us. The Deputy Prime Minister, Mary  Coughlan, chaired the meeting.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Ministers received a presentation from Mark O&rsquo;Kane,  managing director of Marlborough Engineering, Belfast, and from Martin McVicker of  Combilift Ltd, Monaghan, who are both participants in InterTradeIreland&rsquo;s  Acumen programme. Marlborough Engineering employs 35 people, and Combilift  employs 155 people and exports 96% of what it produces to 50 countries  worldwide.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Ministers received a presentation from the chairperson of  InterTradeIreland, Dr David Dobbin, on a strategic review of the body&rsquo;s  operations. The main themes for InterTradeIreland arising from the review are  to increase economic outcomes to optimise the return on public expenditure  through enhanced support in the public procurement market and facilitating new  cross-border co-operation in sectors such as agrifood and renewables; to work  in a more co-ordinated way with sponsor Departments and other economic  development agencies; to focus on activities that offer the greatest economic  benefit; and to increase focus on business and client needs, with greater  clarity on InterTradeIreland&rsquo;s work, marketing and communication.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">InterTradeIreland&rsquo;s chief executive, Liam Nellis, presented  a progress report on the body&rsquo;s work, including the fact that &pound;65&middot;45 million in  business value was generated in 2008 through InterTradeIreland&rsquo;s business  networks and firms engaged in its projects. He pointed out that, in 2008, 590  firms engaged in developing their competitiveness through InterTradeIreland&rsquo;s  initiatives. The Council discussed progress on the body&rsquo;s business plan for  2009.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Ministers received a presentation from Aidan Gough, the  strategy and policy director of InterTradeIreland, on the body&rsquo;s report on  co-operation in the area of science, technology and innovation. The report also  identified a number of areas of potential increased co-operation, such as  policy co-ordination; research pooling; expansion of the US-Ireland Research  and Development Partnership; business-to-business innovation vouchers; new  market opportunities from technology convergence; a new market entry innovation  programme; and the expansion of the Women in Technology and Science (WITS)  re-enter programme.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Council noted InterTradeIreland&rsquo;s annual review of  activities and annual accounts of 2007.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Council agreed that its next meeting in trade and  business development sectoral format will take place in November or December  2009. I commend the statement to the Assembly.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Campbell</strong>:  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement. Is the Minister going to look at the  cost-effectiveness of InterTradeIreland and other bodies that operate between Northern Ireland  and the Republic in order to ensure the greatest value for money for taxpayers?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: As the Member knows, the St Andrews Agreement review is  ongoing. Obviously, if there is to be cost-effectiveness in Departments, both  in Northern Ireland and in  the Republic of Ireland, it is only right, as far as we  are all concerned, that the same cost-effectiveness is required from  North/South bodies. Certainly, InterTradeIreland is highly aware that value for  money must be a key priority of its work. I keep a close eye on that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We have not agreed the business plans for 2010 and 2011: it  is hoped that we will be able to sign those off in the near future. In any  event, the 2009 business plan will come before the next sectoral meeting in  order to be signed off. It is hugely important that value for money is at the  centre of the North/South Ministerial Council&rsquo;s work in this sector, as in  others.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I call the Chairperson of the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment, Mr Alban  Maginness. I apologise, Mr Maginness, for not giving you your rightful place.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment (Mr A Maginness)</strong>: Not at all, Mr Deputy Speaker.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Minister for her detailed statement. I welcome  her home from India,  where, undoubtedly, she did good work on behalf of all Members of the House.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister stated that a main theme for InterTradeIreland  is:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;to increase economic outcomes to optimise the return  on public expenditure through enhanced support in the public procurement market  and facilitating new cross-border co-operation in sectors such as agri-food and  renewables.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Is the Minister aware of the anomaly that exists in the  systems that operate for renewables in Northern Ireland and the South? To  sell electricity from renewable sources in Northern Ireland, a renewables  obligation certificate is required, whereas, in the South, the system is based  on feed-in tariffs. That means that if I were to produce energy from wind in  west Tyrone, it would be disadvantageous for me to export that energy to  Donegal. Will the Minister comment on that issue and raise it with the North/South  Ministerial Council in order to create a situation in which renewable energy  can be exported from one jurisdiction to the other with ease?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: I thank the Member for his kind words. I made it back from India, probably  much to some people&rsquo;s dismay.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The point that I made about renewables in my statement  referred mainly to sharing information on renewable-energy technologies.  However, the Member has made a fair point; therefore, I will deal with the  difference between the system in Northern Ireland  and that of the Republic   of Ireland. The Member is  correct: the Republic   of Ireland has a feed-in  tariff system. That is how people are incentivised to get involved in the  renewable energy market there. However, throughout the United Kingdom,  a system of renewables obligation certificates is in operation.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Recently, we looked at the entire area of the Northern Ireland  renewables obligation (NIRO). Later, during Question Time, I will refer to that  issue. Soon, we will have consultation on the differences between the two  systems; whether we need to look at other ways to incentivise people to become  involved in renewable energy, and how we can make it attractive for producers  of small amounts of renewable energy to get involved in the market.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">That consultation, during which we will raise the issue of  feed-in tariffs as opposed to renewables obligation certificates, will take  place in the near future. We are looking into that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am very alert to the issue. However, we are without  legislative cover to have a feed-in tariff at the moment. If, after discussion  and consultation, it is decided that we need to look at the issue of a feed-in  tariff, we will have to legislate for that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The reason that we are without legislative cover is quite  simple: when the renewables obligation legislation was going through the  Parliament at Westminster,  the House of Lords put in a new clause that allowed GB to have feed-in tariffs  for small-scale renewables. Unfortunately, we did not have the opportunity to  be involved in that, because I would have had to bring a legislative consent  motion to the House, and we simply did not have the time.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, we do not have the legislative cover to provide  for feed-in tariffs in the way that GB has for small-scale renewables. We are  alert to the issue, and we hope to consult on it in the near future.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for her  statement. She referred to the public procurement market. Other reports that  are coming out today recognise the importance of the social economy sector in  reducing deprivation and increasing labour participation. Was the issue of  public procurement contracts being opened up to the social economy sector on a  cross-border, all-island basis discussed at the meeting?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: Public procurement is an issue in which InterTradeIreland has  been very much involved. The Member is probably aware that public procurement  is a huge market that companies can get involved in across the Republic of Ireland  and Northern Ireland.  About &pound;17 billion per annum is spent on public procurement in the two  jurisdictions. That being the case, InterTradeIreland sees it as a very  significant market opportunity for the companies with which it works. It has  set up a scheme called Go-2-Tender that allows companies to access that market  opportunity specifically.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am talking about smaller companies in particular, because  Members, including Ms McCann, have expressed concerns that some smaller  companies &mdash; and let us face the fact that Northern Ireland has a small to  medium-sized economy &mdash; cannot access public procurement. Go-2-Tender is an  important programme that InterTradeIreland is working on to support people so  that they have the opportunity to win those contracts. Given that &pound;17 billion  is spent on public procurement annually, it is vital that companies know how  that works.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Some companies in Northern   Ireland were able to avail themselves of Government  contracts in the Republic   of Ireland recently.  However, some people in the Republic   of Ireland were not too  happy about that. During the summer, Members might have heard people on the  radio condemning the fact that companies from Northern Ireland were able to get  those Government contracts. However, I think that it is vital that we support  those companies, because we want our companies to be able to export and to find  opportunities and go for them. The Go-2-Tender programme is a very important  part of InterTradeIreland&rsquo;s work, and I very much want to see it expanding and  doing more.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>: I,  too, welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement and welcome her back from India. I  thought that I got the whiff of &ldquo;eau de madras&rdquo; as she passed by.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister referred to the fact that the business plan  for this year is being prepared by InterTradeIreland. Will she advise us as to  whether any change of emphasis or direction is being considered, bearing in  mind that we are still going through the worst recession in living memory?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: I am glad to tell the Member that I was not in Chennai, so I  did not have any madras. However, I was in three other cities.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We found it regrettable that we did not have the 2009  business plan before us in July, because we would have liked to have been able  to sign off on that. We know that the economic climate in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland  has become extremely difficult. I think, therefore, that it was right to look  again at the business plan.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">11.15 am</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">My Department and the corresponding Department in the Republic of Ireland published guidance on efficiency  savings recently. We hope that that will mean that the revised 2009 business  plan &mdash; and, indeed, the 2010 business plan &mdash; will come forward in the near  future. Hopefully, that will be available at the next sectoral meeting, which  is to be held in November or December. Those plans will be subject to  ministerial approval by me and by the Deputy Prime Minister in the Republic of Ireland, Mary Coughlan. When we get  those plans, we will look at how they deal with the current economic crisis.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">However, we cannot be short term in what we do as regards  InterTradeIreland or Invest Northern Ireland, a subject to which I am sure we  will return later today. It is true that we need to plan for what is happening  now. However, we also need to look to the medium term and the longer term, and  I hope that the business plan will take that into account.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Moutray</strong>:  Will the Minister indicate what InterTradeIreland is doing to help Northern Ireland companies to secure new  business in the Republic   of Ireland, especially  given the current advantageous sterling:euro exchange rate?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: I mentioned already public procurement and the Go-2-Tender  programme. At present, the competitiveness of Northern Ireland firms is partly  what makes them attractive, and the exchange rate gives us a competitive  advantage. We are ensuring that InterTradeIreland is working with companies in Northern Ireland  to allow them to take advantage of that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There are a number of programmes through which companies do  that. For example, I referred to the Acumen programme. We had presentations  from a company in Belfast  and another in Monaghan explaining how they used the Acumen programme to help  identify new market opportunities in the two jurisdictions. Network+Getwork is  another such programme, and it is a buyer-and-supplier programme. That is  delivered in partnership with the Chamber of Commerce movement, and it helps  companies to break into the supply chains of some of the largest organisations.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There is a recurring theme, in that we have small companies  that need the knowledge that will empower them to break into the bigger  markets. InterTradeIreland is working collaboratively with Invest Northern Ireland and with Enterprise  Ireland in the Republic of Ireland so that it can give as much  information as possible to our smaller firms.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Butler</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I welcome the Minister home, and I  hope that the trade mission to India  was a success.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister mentioned InterTradeIreland&rsquo;s report on  innovation, science and technology. The report on the independent review of  economic policy (IREP)shows that there needs to be a greater emphasis on  innovation and research and development. Does the Minister agree that if those  are to be increased, there must be greater co-operation with InterTradeIreland  and more investment by her Department?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: The Member referred to the IREP report, which is published  today. That report states that there is a need for greater emphasis on  innovation and research and development, and InterTradeIreland recognises that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I talked about looking to the short term, medium term and  long term. If we examine only the difficulties that we are experiencing now, it  is very easy for us to look for jobs, of any description, and get them into our  economy. People are hurting and they need jobs, and I recognise that. However,  if we are to make the step change that is required for Northern Ireland through Invest Northern Ireland, we  need to look at innovation and research and development. I know that that is a  difficult message at this particular time, dealing as we are with the economic  crisis. However, if we invest in those areas, I believe that the economy will  grow and become the open regional economy that we very much want it to be.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Invest Northern    Ireland and InterTradeIreland work  collaboratively on issues such as innovation and research and development. I do  not want duplication, and I am sure that the Member would agree with that. However,  if there are ways in which those organisations can work together and enhance  each other&rsquo;s work, that is the sort of thing that I want to see happening.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  I welcome the Minister back from her travels, and I welcome her statement.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister indicate whether there was a ceiling on  the number of women who qualified for participation in the pilot exercise for  the WITS re-enter programme? Given that the success of that exercise in  attracting women back into the workforce is there for all to see, are there any  plans to role out the programme across Northern   Ireland and the Republic of Ireland?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: The expansion of the programme is something that we want to  look at, and it is something that InterTradeIreland feels should be looked at.  This is about encouraging more women to come back into the workplace,  particularly in the areas of science and technology.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There were 20 recruits in the pilot exercise: five were  from Northern Ireland and 15  were from the Republic   of Ireland. Fifteen of  them have already returned to careers in science and technology and a further  four are actively seeking employment. Of the five Northern Ireland participants, four  have returned to careers in science and technology, which is a good indicator  that the programme has worked well. I want to see it developing and that there  is no ceiling on the number of participants so that more women can become  involved. We should be encouraging women to return to work after childbirth.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr McDonnell</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her statement. She does herself an injustice: the  charm, energy and gravitas that she brings to the Assembly and the Executive  have been missing for the past week. A sense of lethargy and limpness had crept  in, but I can feel that fading fast this morning.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In some of the questions that I have heard asked this  morning &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. This is the time for questions, Dr McDonnell. You seem to  have a great difficulty using five words instead of 20. I ask you get to your  question.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr McDonnell</strong>:  I was about to.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In some of the questions this morning, there has been an  undercurrent of perceived underachievement with regard to InterTradeIreland.  Has the Minister had any serious discussions with the chairperson of that body,  David Dobbin, or the chief executive, Liam Nellis, on the achievement of its  targets in the past year and what the aims are for next year? I sense that  InterTradeIreland is achieving a lot, but I am worried about the undercurrents  of perceived underachievement.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: First, I thank the Member for missing me: it is nice to be  missed.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">InterTradeIreland is doing a very good job, and so is  Invest Northern Ireland.  I spent a week in India with  Invest Northern Ireland and  saw the level of research that it carries out and the number of meetings that  it arranges &mdash; 26 companies were at over 100 meetings in India. That  does not take away from the fact that we need to look continuously at such  organisations, which is what today is about for Invest Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">That is also what the strategic review did for  InterTradeIreland, which is why David Dobbin briefed Ministers on the strategic  review at that meeting. It was important for us to hear the issues that he  mentioned, such as the need by the two Departments that sponsor  InterTradeIreland to work in a more co-ordinated way; the need to work with  other economic development agencies, such as Enterprise Ireland and Invest  Northern Ireland; the need to focus on activities that offer the greatest  economic benefit, which Members will agree is very important; and the need to  have greater clarity on the work of InterTradeIreland, such as its marketing  and communications.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member is correct, but he will agree that there is  always a need to review organisations, which is why David Dobbin was very clear  in his comments to me at that meeting.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Will the Minister detail the main  obstacles to cross-border mobility that remain in the areas of trade and  business and outline how she and her Department plan to address them?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Will she also detail the main characteristics and benefits  of the Acumen programme? The Minister said that the programme tries to identify  new market opportunities. How successful has it been?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: The Acumen programme has been one of the success stories for  InterTradeIreland. Perhaps the Member is aware of companies in his constituency  that have taken advantage of the programme. A number of companies in Northern Ireland  &mdash; some in my constituency &mdash; have benefited greatly from the Acumen programme.  It is a sales and marketing programme that goes into small companies, gives  them the expertise to sell their wares &mdash; that is, sadly, sometimes lacking in  some smaller companies &mdash; and helps them to identify and scope out new market  opportunities. That is just one of the programmes in which InterTradeIreland  engages. It also works in co-operation with some of Invest Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  programmes.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Aidan Gough, InterTradeIreland&rsquo;s strategy and policy  director, suggested areas in which he felt that there was a need to expand or  to look at new ways to work together, whether in policy co-ordination, research  pooling, new market opportunities, the WITS re-enter programme, to which I  referred, and new market-entry innovation programmes.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">InterTradeIreland is working in a number of areas, and it  is working better with Invest Northern Ireland. It helps that some  InterTradeIreland board members are also on the board of Invest Northern Ireland. There  is, therefore, a crossover and an understanding of what is going on in the two  bodies.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I, too, welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement. My concern is about Invest Northern Ireland and  InterTradeIreland working together, an issue that she has mentioned. I  congratulate InterTradeIreland for the volume of business that it has brought  across the whole island   of Ireland. How can that  best be taken forward by Invest Northern Ireland?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment</strong>: InterTradeIreland  and Invest Northern Ireland  have different remits and roles. There has been a concern that there may have  been some duplication in what they did. InterTradeIreland is meant to operate  in areas of business competitiveness that are common to all economic  development agencies, but it engages only in those initiatives that require  funding in both jurisdictions; that is, the Republic of Ireland and Northern  Ireland. In addition, when we do economic appraisals on InterTradeIreland, one  marker that we use is that it must not duplicate what other agencies are doing.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In the past, InterTradeIreland was, perhaps, perceived as a  body that worked only along the border, in areas such as Fermanagh, Tyrone and Armagh. I have recently seen InterTradeIreland going into  places such as Ballymena, holding road shows and helping to deal with the  credit crunch in those areas. I applaud InterTradeIreland for doing that and  want to encourage it in that, because it has much to offer Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Anderson</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat. I thank the Minister for her statement. I am aware that my  point may be a repetition of points that have already been made. I appreciate  that the Minister probably feels a need to defend or support Invest NI.  However, given the review into Invest NI, and in the context of the Minister&rsquo;s  statement that referred to the review into InterTradeIreland and a need for  better co-operation and collaboration, there are genuine concerns in  constituencies about Invest NI. There are concerns about it working with  agencies such as Enterprise Ireland and how  a more collaborative and co-operative approach will be achieved.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am concerned that if the recommendations and findings are  not embraced fully in order to make Invest NI a more effective, efficient and  better economic development agency that will work with Enterprise  Ireland,  and then, together, work with InterTradeIreland, we might lose an opportunity.  I ask the Minister to take into account &mdash; as I am sure she will &mdash; all those  recommendations, but to do that in the context of improving the relationship  between InterTradeIreland and Invest NI.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">11.30 am</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment</strong>: In the past, there may have been some  overlap between InterTradeIreland and Invest Northern Ireland, and  relationships may not have been as strong as they should have been. Those  relationships have improved, and I think that they will continue to improve. I  do not feel the need to defend Invest NI. When Members receive the report,  which is quite hefty, they should take the time to read it. It contains  constructive criticism, and Members should bear that in mind.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There is little point in my asking for an independent  report on Invest Northern Ireland and, indeed, my policies in the Department of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment for it to recommend no changes. We need to  examine the report in its totality, consider the constructive criticism and  take on board any ways in which we might improve the Northern Ireland economy&rsquo;s  overall performance. I hope that people will take the time to read the entire  report. Thereafter, I intend to make it subject to a short consultation period  &mdash; probably around six weeks &mdash; and proceed from there.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I assure the Member that, given that I commissioned the  report, I will read it and consider its comments very carefully.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: That concludes questions to the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment on her statement. The Minister of Finance and Personnel is not yet  in his place, so I ask Members to take their ease until the Minister arrives.</p>
      <p class="H4StageHeading"><a name="3"></a>North/South Ministerial Council</p>
      <p class="H4StageHeading">Special EU Programmes Sectoral Format</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Speaker has received notice from the Minister of Finance and  Personnel that he wishes, albeit late, to make a statement on the meeting of  the North/South Ministerial Council (NSMC) in special EU programmes sectoral  format.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel (Mr S Wilson)</strong>: I hope that the title &ldquo;late Finance  Minister&rdquo; does not become attached to me. I apologise for my delay in arriving  in the Chamber.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The North/South Ministerial Council met in special EU  programmes sectoral format in Dublin on 8 September 2009. It was the first NSMC  meeting in that format since November 2007. The Government of the Republic of  Ireland were represented by the Minister for Finance, Brian Lenihan, who  chaired the meeting. I represented the Northern Ireland Executive and was  accompanied by junior Minister Gerry Kelly.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The meeting began with a presentation from Pat Colgan,  chief executive of the Special EU Programmes Body (SEUPB), who updated the  Council on developments since the meeting in November 2007. Mr Colgan noted a number  of achievements over the two-year period, including the ongoing work to close  the old Peace II and INTERREG IIIa programmes. SEUPB expects both programmes to  earn all available EU receipts. Mr Colgan informed the Council that the SEUPB&rsquo;s  annual report and accounts for 2007 and 2008 are fully up to date and have  received clean audit reports from the Comptroller and Auditor General for  Northern Ireland and his counterpart in the Republic.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Colgan updated the Council on the current Peace III and  INTERREG IVa programmes, both of which have been open to funding applications  since the end of 2007. Several hundred project applications have been assessed.  Of those, close to 150 have met the agreed project selection criteria and have  been approved for funding. However, the very ambitious levels of Peace and  INTERREG programme spending that the SEUPB had forecast for 2008 were not fully  achieved. Nonetheless, SEUPB is confident that both programmes will achieve  their respective first EU spending targets by December 2009.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, Mr Colgan mentioned the SEUPB&rsquo;s ongoing work to  develop local projects that might compete for funding under the EU&rsquo;s  transnational and inter-regional programmes. The Council welcomed the progress  that has been made in implementing the Peace III programme. More than 100  projects have been approved, representing &euro;156 million of programme funds. That  is close to half the available programme budget of &euro;333 million, and includes  the &euro;13 million allocated to Ilex to take forward the construction of the Foyle  footbridge and &euro;55 million that has been made available to councils, North and  South, to take forward their peace and reconciliation local action plans.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Council welcomed progress on the Peace III theme  &lsquo;Acknowledging and Dealing with the Past&rsquo;, which has a special focus on the  needs of victims and survivors of the terrorist campaign. To date, 55 projects  have been approved under that theme, on which &euro;22 million of programme funds  have been spent. Ministers noted that the SEUPB has been engaged proactively in  outreach measures with groups that are under-represented among the programme  beneficiaries, including the Protestant community. The purpose of that outreach  work is to ensure that all communities participate fully in the programme. Ministers  also noted the work that is under way to share the experiences of peace funding  through the development of a peace network.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Ministers welcomed the progress that has been made on the  INTERREG IVa cross-border programme, which has a budget of &euro;256 million. To  date, 34 projects have been approved, representing funding of &euro;151 million &mdash;  more than half the programme total. The continued participation of the five  local authority partnership groups was noted and welcomed. Those groups were a  particular success of the earlier INTERREG programme.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Ministers welcomed the participation of Scotland, which is  newly eligible under the INTERREG IVa programme. To date, Scotland has been a  very active newcomer; Scottish partners are involved in 13 of the projects thus  far approved.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Council noted that this year, and in all subsequent  years, the significant challenge under Peace III and INTERREG IV is to  translate commitments into actual expenditure. Both programmes will have to  meet the challenging annual spending targets set by the European Commission.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Ministers were encouraged by the SEUPB&rsquo;s work to promote  North/South participation in the EU&rsquo;s transnational and inter-regional  programmes. The Council discussed the SEUPB business plan and budget for 2009,  including the need for efficiencies. Finally, the Council noted the SEUPB&rsquo;s  annual report and accounts for 2007 and 2008. The Council aims to meet again in  special EU programmes sectoral format early in the new year.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Finance and Personnel (Ms J McCann)</strong>: Go raibh maith  agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his statement. I want to  ask him about match funding. I am sure that he is aware that many organisations  that have already received special EU funding were unable to secure match  funding, which made things difficult for them. Was there any discussion, or was  any information provided, about following the example of other European  Governments who have given full match funding to similar organisations in their  countries?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: The issue of match funding was not raised.  Nevertheless, I understand the point that the Member has made. I will make a  note of it and seek to raise the issue at the next meeting, which will take  place early in the new year. It is something that we can examine before that  meeting, as can the SEUPB.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I was not aware that there was flexibility to move away  from match funding; my understanding was that it was an intrinsic part of funding  that is made available through the programmes. If there are ways in which other  countries have dealt with match funding, that is well and good.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">If match funding was possible, and was to be done, it would  simply mean that all funding would come from the same pot, and fewer projects  would be able to secure funding. Therefore, there would also be a downside. The  whole point of match funding is that EU money would lever in money from other  sources, therefore adding value.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his statement. He indicated that the INTERREG programme  spending forecast for 2008 had not been met, but that the SEUPB was confident  that both programmes would achieve their EU spending targets by December 2009.  Can the Minister indicate what the level of shortfall was for the targets in  2008? What action is being taken to ensure that those can confidently be met by  December 2009?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I hope that I have not given the wrong impression.  The first target date is at the end of this year. In working to that target, it  would be a wise precaution for any organisation to have a profile of how it  expects to spend its money until that target date. I do not have the exact  figure on the shortfall to date.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">One reason why the profile might not be continuous is that  a lot of the programmes and projects are now much larger than they were in the  past. Previously, a lot of small programmes spent smaller amounts of money. In  moving towards larger programmes, each with a larger spend, the profiles may be  less even than they were in the past.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">A number of projects are in the pipeline, some of which  have tight deadlines. For example, Members from the Foyle constituency will be  aware of the Ilex programme. Some large programmes will require planning  permission, and so forth, which can cause delays and affect the profile of  spend. I have been assured that local authorities have been working hard to  ensure that they will do all that they can to facilitate those projects. Again,  the Ilex project is a good example, in that planning was brought forward more  quickly to enable the project to be on stream for the end of the year. In doing  that, the targets should be met.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  The Minister alluded to the fact that, in light of the further expansion of the  EU, the ongoing recession and fiscal constraints, EU funding programmes are  less likely to be prevalent in Northern Ireland in the forthcoming years. We  are aware of that; however, large parts of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s social economy  are reliant on EU funding. What steps are the Executive taking to prepare  Northern Ireland&rsquo;s social economy for such changes? Have any discussions taken  place at a North/South level about making our social economy more sustainable?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I did not say in my statement that we expect EU  funding to fall in the future, although I suppose that one may surmise that to  be the case. The social economy does rely heavily on EU funding, and that is an  issue that individual Departments need to deal with. For example, DSD has a  huge interface with the social economy and with a lot of community groups, and,  through the kinds of projects that are now being granted permission, it is  working hard on the infrastructure that will be attached to those community  groups. Such infrastructure should, therefore, help to give them a sustainable  income afterwards. That is the way forward.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">11.45 am</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There is always a conflict about whether to fund workers or  to fund infrastructure. Funding infrastructure will give groups the ability to  generate income and to be more sustainable in the future. We have all had a  debate about that conflict. A lot of people are employed in the social economy  on the basis of the grants that are coming forward. However, we are moving in  the right direction in the long term. We are looking at improving  infrastructure, which will hopefully enable groups to become more sustainable.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  very much welcome the fact that, as part of the Peace III measure  &lsquo;Acknowledging and dealing with the past&rsquo;, &euro;22 million has been spent on the  needs of victims and survivors. What is distinctive about the Peace III spend  on victims and survivors? It is very important that what is done on the ground  in relation to victims and survivors meets the Executive&rsquo;s top-down policies.  Following the Eames/Bradley report, will the Minister give his commitment to a  very robust method of finding the truth about the past? Pain and embarrassment  will be caused to many people, but does the Minister accept that that is  necessary if we are to deal with the past properly?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: There was widespread concern about the way in which  Peace II funding was used because of the emphasis that was placed on one side  of our society. It is welcome that, for the first time, much more money is  being spent on victims and survivors&rsquo; groups than has been spent on ex-prisoner  groups. People demanded, and will welcome, that shift.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I do not want to dictate the kind of projects that victims  and survivors, groups should undertake. Some of the work may be about finding  out what happened in the past. I am more disposed towards groups that work to  help people who are still suffering from what happened in the past, whether  physically, financially or through keeping some kind of contact to avoid  isolation. However, whatever groups require should be the emphasis of the  funding. The main theme is to acknowledge and deal with the past, but people  have their own way of dealing with the past. I am not necessarily of the view  that dealing with the past simply means digging up everything that happened in  a search for explanations.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  declare an interest as a member of the Community Relations Council.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">What efforts are being made to ensure that the Peace III  investment is co-ordinated with other good-relations projects? Efforts must be  made to ensure that there is no duplication; that the two approaches complement  each other; and that long-term funding programmes are not undermined by the impact  of a short-term injection of Peace III money.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">A number of bodies that were funded under Peace II are  unlikely to qualify for funding under the Peace III criteria. What steps are  being taken to manage expectations and to explain to groups why they are no  longer in a position to receive funding because of changes in the rules?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: Groups know well that Peace III was not a  continuation of Peace II, and great lengths were gone to to explain that. Some  of the groups may not like that answer, but there has never been any attempt to  hide the answer or an explanation of the new criteria from them.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member makes an important point about duplication. One  of the ways in which we have attempted to get around duplication and the  plethora of bodies that deal with funding is by rationalising the number of  local strategy partnerships from 26 to 11 and reducing the number of  implementing bodies. That, in itself, helped to remove some of the confusion  and duplication. As a result, SEUPB took on more work. That is one reason why  SEUPB&rsquo;s staffing levels have gone up considerably, although that issue must be  dealt with in the future.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I declare an interest as a member of the East Border Region Committee (EBRC). I  thank the Minister for his statement. Will he explain why that NSMC meeting was  the first in that sectoral format?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am sure that the Minister is well aware, from his  experience as a local councillor, that organisations are always chasing  deadlines, because there is a delay, either at programme body or European  level, in their receiving information and application forms. Will he explain  that?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister tell the House how much money was  returned to the EU last year and why? Will he conduct an analysis of that to  ensure that it does not happen again? I also ask him to give us a flavour of  the types of projects that cross-border bodies are funding and to tell us which  ones are particularly welcome?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: First, I hope that the Member does not blame me for  the fact that there had been no NSMC meeting in special EU programmes sectoral  format since November 2007. I arranged this month&rsquo;s meeting as quickly as I  could. Delays occurred partly as a result of difficulties in the Irish Republic.  A first meeting was delayed because Ministers in the Republic were diverted by  the first referendum on the Lisbon Treaty. I suppose that if the vote does not  go the way in which Europe wants it to on Friday, there will be a third  referendum, because that is how Europe tends to work &mdash; it just wears people  down. I would have thought that it would have been sufficient for Europe for  the people of the Irish Republic to speak once, but apparently not. Europe  never takes no for an answer.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">A second meeting, which was to be held in November 2008,  was cancelled because our Executive were not meeting.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I wonder why that was.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I think we know the reason. The irony is, of course,  that the Executive were not meeting because Sinn F&eacute;in had some difficulty, and  I am afraid that it was the fault not of unionists but of republicans that  cross-border meetings did not happen. That is one of the ironies of our  situation.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The meeting that was scheduled for April 2009 was cancelled,  at the request of the Dublin Minister, who was tied up with emergency Budget  business.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that the Member can see that unionists were not to  blame for any of the delays. They were caused by a combination of Ministers and  events in the Republic and the difficulties that existed with the Executive and  Sinn F&eacute;in. I hope that the Member is assured that we are not dragging our heels  on the matter.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, the delays should not have impacted on funding  applications, because the North/South Ministerial Council does not deal with  the detail of applications.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As far as the shortfall and the amount of money given back  is concerned, no money was returned and, therefore, no analysis is required.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I know that Members are allowed to ask only one question.  However, Mr Deputy Speaker, you indulged the Member, but I cannot remember her  third question. If she wants to repeat it, I will try to give her an answer.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I call Mr John Dallat.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>: I  also welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement. He referred to the wonderful Ilex  project in Derry that includes the provision of a footbridge across the Foyle.  Is he aware that another means of crossing the river a bit further downstream,  the Foyle ferry service, may no longer be available from tomorrow? Will he tell  the House whether any efforts have been made to obtain funding for that  service?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I picked up on that in the news yesterday. I  understand that the Foyle ferry had been jointly funded by councils in the  Republic and Northern Ireland, but that both have decided not to continue  providing that support. I am not aware that any application has been made for  funding through any of the EU programmes. I will ask whether that is the case  and write to the Member.</p>
      <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="4"></a>Executive Committee Business</p>
      <p class="H4StageHeading">Water and Sewerage Services &nbsp;(Amendment) Bill</p>
      <p class="H4StageHeading">Second Stage</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development (Mr Murphy)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
      <p class="Q3Motion">That the Second Stage of the Water and Sewerage Services  (Amendment) Bill [NIA 3/09] be agreed.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The Bill amends the Water and Sewerage Services  (Northern Ireland) Order 2006 to extend by three years the period during which  my Department is prepared to subsidise NI Water (NIW) in lieu of customer  payments. If the change were not made, the existing provision for the payment  of a subsidy would expire on 31 March 2010.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In wider terms, the effect of the Bill is to provide for  the continuance of a sound legal basis on which the Executive can pay domestic  customers&rsquo; bills on their behalf. It gives financial stability to NIW and  ensures that the funding to allow the delivery of services is provided.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I appreciate that much wider questions exist about how the  Assembly should deal with the future funding of water, but the Bill does not  address those: that is a matter on which the Executive must decide. The  three-year extension of the subsidy simply provides for the continuance of  current funding arrangements.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I have set out the principle that underlies the legislation  and what will be achieved by its introduction, the necessity for which is  self-evident. I commend the Bill to the Assembly.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Regional Development (Mr Cobain)</strong>: As Chairperson, I  welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Second Stage of this  important Bill. The issue today is whether the Assembly is content to endorse  the principles of the Water and Sewerage Services (Amendment) Bill 2009. In the  absence of funding through payment by customers, the Bill aims to ensure the  continued provision of a subsidy to Northern Ireland Water.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Under article 213(3) of the Water and Sewerage Services  (Northern Ireland) Order 2006, the Department for Regional Development (DRD) is  required to make grants to Northern Ireland Water equal to the amount of  discounts provided to customers in the initial period. The 2006 Order defines  the initial period as three years from the coming into operation of the Order.  During that three-year period, the direct rule Administration had intended to  phase in charges for water and sewerage services. That initial period expires  on 31 March 2010, and the Department has stated its willingness to make grants  to Northern Ireland Water after that date.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As the Minister said, the Executive have yet to make a  decision on the future funding of water and sewerage services. Even if a  decision were to be taken next week, the indications are that Northern Ireland  Water would not be in a position to issue bills and collect revenue by April  2010 as there would not be sufficient time.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee for Regional Development is mindful of the  need to progress business in an efficient and effective manner while  discharging its responsibility for scrutiny to the entire Assembly thoroughly  and conscientiously. The Committee will take that approach with the Bill.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">12.00 noon</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee does not intend to oppose the principles of  the Bill. It is important that Northern Ireland Water operates within a stable  financial environment to ensure that the much-needed sewerage infrastructure  investment programmes make progress and that the planned efficiencies and  service improvements are delivered.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">However, significant financial implications for Northern  Ireland arise from the deferral of charging for water and sewerage services.  This Bill creates the mechanism to put into action a decision by the Executive  to continue to defer water and sewerage charges. Recently, there have been some  discussions in the media about the impact on the Northern Ireland block grant  of deferring water and sewerage charges. The Committee explored some of those  issues with DRD officials during pre-introduction briefings and over the course  of the previous session as the issues emerged.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">At Committee Stage, we will seek clarity of the costs of  continued deferral, including the costs that are associated with the reclassification  of Northern Ireland Water for public expenditure purposes, the basis for  valuing Northern Ireland Water assets and the ongoing ability of Northern  Ireland Water to reclaim its input VAT. The Committee will also seek clarity of  the financial impact that ongoing deferrals may have on the Northern Ireland  block grant as a whole, the DRD budget and the budgets of other Departments.  The Committee looks forward to receiving this Bill at Committee Stage. I assure  the House and the Minister that this Bill will be treated by the Committee as a  matter of priority.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Miss McIlveen</strong>:  As the Chairman of the Committee for Regional Development indicated, the  Committee discussed the principles of the Water and Sewerage Services  (Amendment) Bill and has agreed to support them.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is a very short Bill that appears to be mainly technical  in nature, the purpose of it being to continue the customer subsidy to Northern  Ireland Water (NIW). As was indicated, the power that was given to the  Department under the Water and Sewerage Service (Northern Ireland) Order 2006  to pay the grant equal to the amount of discounts to customers comes to an end  on 31 March. Obviously, the direct rule Administration had anticipated that the  phasing in of charges for water and sewerage services would have been complete  at that stage. Members are clearly aware that that is not the case and that  water charges have been deferred, hence the requirement for this legislation.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is my understanding that if the payment does not  continue from 1 April 2010, Northern Ireland Water will be unable to pay for  the delivery of what we very much take for granted; that is, water and sewerage  services. Due to a legacy of many years of under&shy;investment in our  infrastructure, Northern Ireland has lagged behind the rest of the United  Kingdom. Only in recent years have we started to see the benefits of investment.  I know that in my constituency, a substantial number of infrastructure  programmes are being carried out and are planned for. Future investment in  water is critical from an environmental and a health perspective.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The issue of water and how it is paid for is hugely  emotive. The Chairman highlighted the issues around the continued deferral of  water charges. However, it would probably be mischievous and unwise for us to  deviate from the principles of the Bill that is before us today. At this stage,  I am content to accept the principles of the Bill. I look forward to the  Committee Stage.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCartney</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Ar dt&uacute;s, ba mhaith liom a r&aacute; go  mbeidh Sinn F&eacute;in ag tac&uacute; leis an Bhille, agus t&aacute;imid ar son lean&uacute;int ar aghaidh  leis an obair seo.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in will support the taking forward of this Bill. The  Water and Sewerage Services (Amendment) Bill is designed to ensure the  continued provision of a subsidy to NIW by the Department. Therefore, as has  been stated, it is very much a technical Bill.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The current situation is that the Department&rsquo;s ability and  legal competence to pay a subsidy to NIW expires on 31 March 2010. That was a  condition that was laid out in the Water and Sewerage Services Order 2006,  which, in essence, established the company on 1 April 2007. If that Order  expires, there will be no provision for the Department to provide grants or  subsidies to NIW. Therefore, the company&rsquo;s ability to exist and its ability to  continue with the provision and management of our water and sewerage system  will come to an end. This Bill will provide the basis to move forward and allow  NIW to continue with its investment programmes and related works.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the decision, as outlined by the Chairperson,  that the Committee for Regional Development supports the principles of the  Bill. We look forward to working with it. Irrespective of decisions that were  made in the past by previous Administrations &mdash; all of us have our own views of  those decisions &mdash; as the Chairperson pointed out, it is incumbent on all of us  to ensure that NIW operates within a financially stable environment and to  allow the continuation of its work. The Bill allows that to happen.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We also support the Bill because it creates a mechanism by  which the Executive can continue to defer water and sewerage charges. I agree  with the Chairperson that it will be important to seek clarification at  Committee Stage of the direct and indirect costs of deferral. Those issues have  been discussed on many occasions at the Committee and will, undoubtedly, be  revisited at Committee Stage.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the commitment of the Chairperson, the Deputy  Chairperson and the Committee to prioritise the Bill. I assure the Minister of  the full co-operation of Members on this side of the House as he takes the Bill  forward. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  I apologise to the House, and to the Minister in particular, for being a few  minutes late for the debate; I was delayed at a meeting of the all-party  Assembly group on learning disability.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP has serious concerns about the Bill. For one  thing, the full financial implications have yet to be debated fully and openly.  We are being asked to support a Bill that, we are led to believe, will give the  Executive the option to continue to fund Northern Ireland Water through the  payment of a customer subsidy. However, neither the Department for Regional  Development nor the Department of Finance and Personnel (DFP) will state  convincingly that they will use that option if the Bill is approved by the  Assembly.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Members should remind themselves that, at present, the  public are worried, mainly about their jobs, mortgages and impossible increases  on rates bills. The shadow of potential water charges now hangs over that. Only  last week, the Minister for Regional Development said that he was unable to  rule out the introduction of water charges during this Assembly&rsquo;s lifetime.  Around the same time, the Minister of Finance and Personnel said that he may be  forced to introduce water charges because of pressures on the block grant.  Indeed, his Department&rsquo;s costings for previous years included allowances for  payments through water charges.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Those comments and documents from the heart of Government,  some of them leaked, tell us that, despite the absence of debate, the public  are completely bewildered about water charges, particularly in relation to the  positions of Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP. Prior to elections, those parties told the  public that they would stop the introduction of water charges. That is not what  happened.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  My party&rsquo;s position is perfectly clear; the position of the Member&rsquo;s party, on  the other hand, is a little more confused. If he is so opposed to the  introduction of water charges at any stage and under any circumstances, will he  explain why his colleague the Minister for Social Development, Margaret  Ritchie, voted in the Executive for a Budget predicated on the introduction of  water charges by now?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  We all understand very well that we have a strange democracy here, in which,  under a ministerial code, Ministers are required to support Executive  decisions. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am outlining the party&rsquo;s position, and I referred to the  position of Mr Hamilton&rsquo;s party because it is so well known.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Despite all the promises to which I referred, what happened  in 2008? Water charges for businesses were introduced at a 50% rate, and, in  April 2009, they were increased to full charges. How do we explain that to the  public? The best way is to have a full and open debate in the Assembly, and  that has not happened. We have never been afforded that opportunity.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Yet serious problems in relation to Northern Ireland Water  emerge almost every week. Recently, the Utility Regulator published &lsquo;Water and  Sewerage Service Price Control 2010-2013: Draft Determination Summary Report&rsquo;.  It rightly raised the infrastructural problems which we have inherited and  which have to be tackled. It also showed that Northern Ireland Water had bid for  &pound;136 million more than the Utility Regulator deemed necessary. In July,  Northern Ireland Water admitted that it had been overcharging some business  customers. There is a great deal that is not right within the system, and in  the way that we are taking forward the Bill, we are not facing up to that. Let  us see what happens when the Bill gets to Committee Stage. We all know that  there has been no public consultation prior to the introduction of the Bill, so  there is a great deal of work to be done as it progresses through the  Committee. There is a very short time frame, and we are all being put under  pressure to pass the Bill.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I have referred to the infrastructural problems. There is  no doubt that the public wants to see a water service that works efficiently  and provides for the utilities as it is supposed to. Behind all of this lies  the question: has the Treasury put the Executive on notice that it will not  allow us to continue subsidising Northern Ireland Water? That question needs to  be answered. When it is answered, there will be a wider debate on how the issue  is going to be handled. At the Committee Stage, the SDLP will continue to  express very grave concerns about that. At least, we will try to open up a  debate about it.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B Wilson</strong>:  I reluctantly support the Bill. It is disappointing that, after two years, we  have not yet resolved the issue of how to pay for our water, and it is now  necessary to rush this Bill through the Assembly to ensure that Northern  Ireland Water can have funding in the new financial year. However, I recognise  that we must keep that option open and we have to pass the Bill. If we fail to  pass it, Northern Ireland Water could be left in April without funding.  However, even if we pass the Bill, we should not assume that Northern Ireland  Water will be funded automatically from the block grant in the next financial  year.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am opposed to water charges based on property values,  which is the obvious alternative. They are grossly unfair and they fall heavily  on the elderly and those on fixed incomes. However, I recognise that we must  find an alternative means of funding the water and sewerage services. It cannot  continue to be met from the block grant, as that would be at the expense of  other services. Under the Barnett formula, there is no provision for water in  the block grant. In the rest of the UK, consumers pay the charges directly to  water companies and there is no call on public finance. Therefore, we get no  money for the funding of Northern Ireland Water.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Northern Ireland Water must be funded from existing  sources. The alternatives are to fund it from the regional rate or from the  block grant. If the Executive decide to continue funding it from the block  grant, it must inevitably mean a reduction in the resources available for other  services such as housing, health and education. I highlighted that issue in my  Budget speech in November 2007, when I pointed out that, because there was no  alternative funding for water, the budget for the Health Service would have to  be reduced &mdash; and that that would inevitably lead to cuts in service and  significant redundancies. I pointed out at the time that the increase in the  health budget was only 2&middot;6%, which was the lowest for 10 years, and that, in  practice, because of demographic trends and because NHS inflation is  significantly higher than basic inflation, the 2&middot;6% increase for the Health Service  represented at best a freeze in overall expenditure, compared to a 4% increase  in real terms for the Health Service in England. Funding our water means that  there is less funding available for the Health Service.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Budget also referred to new demands that we had to  meet, such as those of the Bamford review. I was just at the learning  disability &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. Mr Wilson, the debate is about the Water and Sewerage  Services (Amendment) Bill; please stick to the issue at hand.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B Wilson</strong>:  Yes; I am sorry, Mr Deputy Speaker. The Bill proposes that water and sewerage  services be funded from the block grant. If that is done, there will be an  impact on all other services. I feel that that is a perfectly legitimate  argument to use.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Independent Water Review Panel, which was chaired by  Professor Paddy Hillyard, examined in detail the question of the funding of  Northern Ireland Water. The Green Party welcomed that report. We had always  argued that water services should be funded from general taxation, and,  therefore, we supported the recommendation that there be no separate water  charges. In accepting the report&rsquo;s main recommendation, which is that the  regional rate be frozen for two years, the Executive gave the impression that  the problem of paying for water and sewerage services had been resolved. In  fact, nothing had changed. Any public celebrations were premature. The issue  has not gone away, and, as we now see, the money is not available for next year  because we did not take any action on the Hillyard report.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>:  Does the Member agree that an opportunity to study in more depth ways to levy  separate water charges fairly and affordably has also been missed? The  assumption was that, because the charges were being deferred, they would not be  implemented. We could now be facing a situation in which they are implemented  in what is not a fair, affordable and transparent way, despite the fact that  there has been a deferral.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B Wilson</strong>:  I thank the Member for that intervention. She raised one of the major points  that I was going to discuss. We had the situation whereby we were going to  introduce the charges based on property values. That would have been grossly  unfair, because it would have hit the poor, the elderly, and those who are on  fixed incomes. We should have been looking at alternative forms of funding at  that stage. The fact is that the opportunity to find fair and alternative forms  of funding has been overlooked. We are now left, in the few months that remain  before the funding runs out, with having to rush this legislation through the  Assembly. We should have been looking at other forms of taxation that are based  on the ability to pay.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We should be looking at the Lyons and Burt reviews from  Scotland and England on other forms of local government finance, for example.  We should be considering options such as a local sales tax, a service tax, and  green taxes that would help the environment as well as raise revenue and that  would be based on the principle that the polluter pays. We should also be  looking at something such as a land value tax. For the past two years, we have  not taken the opportunity to consider the alternatives, and we are now being  pushed into accepting that the charges will come out of the block grant. If  that happens, it must inevitably be at the expense of other services.  Therefore, we will see a reduction in those other services.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, although I support the Bill, I feel that we  should not be rushing it through the Assembly. I hope that the &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  am curious about the Member&rsquo;s assertion that the Bill is being rushed through  the Assembly. There is no accelerated passage, and the Bill will have a full  Committee Stage. How is it being rushed through the Assembly?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B Wilson</strong>:  As far as the business of the Committee for Regional Development is concerned,  everything else has been set aside for the next month. I assure the Member that  the parliamentary timetable is extremely tight.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, I support the Bill, but I hope that we will  find alternative ways of funding the services in question, because the present  method of funding from the block grant or from property taxes is unacceptable.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bresland</strong>:  Although the issue of water charges is one that gives rise to strong views and  often heated debates, it is important to remember that the Water and Sewerage  Services (Amendment) Bill is technical in nature and that we are debating its  Second Stage. We are considering the principles behind the Bill. Those  principles are concise and clear. We need the Bill if Northern Ireland Water is  to be able to continue to provide a water and sewerage service and maintain its  networks beyond next April.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">If the Bill is not passed, we will have a real crisis, and  water charges will have to be introduced from next April. There will be many  more opportunities for a full and frank discussion on the future funding of  water and sewerage services, but, this morning, we must control ourselves and  limit our debate to the Bill that is before the House.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I support the Second Stage of the Bill, and I hope that the  rest of the Assembly will do likewise.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  am happy to support the Second Stage of the Bill. However, I want to follow up  on some of the comments that were made by Mr Cobain, the Chairperson of the  Committee for Regional Development, and by my friend Brian Wilson about the  context in which the Bill is being progressed. There is a financial crisis  facing Northern Ireland, and the Executive need to find major efficiency  savings. Furthermore, it is clear that the Exchequer will call for further cuts  at some stage in the future.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">A lot of parties are engaging in cheap populism over the  issue; they are taking stands and saying that there will be water charges in  Northern Ireland over their dead bodies. I am not sure whether that approach is  realistic and whether they are being frank with the people of Northern Ireland.  In fact, one can foresee a situation in which we will be forced, under European  Union directives, to introduce separate water charges. Leaving that aside, our  current financial context may well mean that it is something that the Executive  have to consider.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Alliance Party has been consistent and straight with  people on the issue. We have not ruled out a situation in which water charges  may have to be introduced, and we were clear on that in our 2007 manifesto for  the Assembly elections. The Executive have a duty to find efficiencies in what  they are doing now, before they go down the path of water charges.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Alliance Party stresses the importance of addressing  the cost of division, and other parties have their hobby horses with regard to  efficiencies. Therefore all those issues are in the mix, but one must be  realistic and recognise that that may not be enough. The Executive will be  faced with a choice. Put simply, and as Brian Wilson outlined, the Executive  will have to consider whether to go for deeper cuts in public services or look  towards the introduction of a form of water charging.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">A lot of people talk about water charges affecting people  who are in need or who are on the margins of society. That brings us to the  whole issue of affordability and ability to pay: a water charge that is based  upon the value of property will not properly reflect that. Neither would such a  system reflect the relative usage of households. For instance, a situation  could arise in which a single pensioner is living next door to a family of four  adults who all earn a wage and who use a lot more water. It would be unfair to  base the water charges for both households on the value of property. However,  if we can find a fairer way of imposing water charges, it will be a progressive  way of raising revenue.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">On the other hand are people who are in difficulty because  of their need for access to public services. They are often the most needy and  disadvantaged people in our society, and they would not be eligible to pay  water charges, if they were introduced. If steep cuts are imposed on the Health  Service, those are the people who will suffer the most. When people talk about  suffering and the disadvantaged in society, let us not focus entirely on the  charges that the Assembly may or may not pass on to individuals; let us look at  the nature and quality of the public services that we are funding and bear in  mind that people are dependent on those and on a high quality of service.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">If water charges are introduced, there is the issue of  people paying twice for water, as part of the regional rate already covers  water. If water charges are introduced, these Benches expect a proportionate  reduction in the regional rate to account for the element that is currently  being paid into the regional rate being transferred into any future water  charges.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In broader terms, the deferral of water charges could be  costing the Executive approximately &pound;200 million a year, which is a  considerable sum. It is the democratic choice of a devolved Executive to defer  water charges, because, as Brian Wilson said, it does not form part of the  Barnett formula. Therefore, the Executive are essentially taking money from the  block grant to fund that deferral and are forgoing the opportunity of spending  resources elsewhere.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly passed a Budget that was based on the initial  deferral of water charges, but water charges have continued to be deferred  without that Budget being modified to take into account the cost of that  deferment. Therefore, decisions and announcements on water charges are now  being made in advance of the budgetary and financial framework having caught  up, and the Executive are having to find money in different areas to plug the  gaps. That is not an appropriate or mature approach to the financial management  of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s scarce resources.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I appreciate that the Bill is designed to give options. I  am happy for everything to remain on the table, but we must be realistic about  where we are heading as a society. If the introduction of water charges is  being considered, we must be straight with people; we must not lead them up the  garden path by telling them that those charges will be withheld at all costs.  Furthermore, if water charges are introduced, we must ensure that the system of  charging used reflects people&rsquo;s ability to pay and is based on their usage  rather than on the value of their property. That system is a very blunt and,  frankly, regressive form of taxation, which I hope all Members would reject;  although I have my doubts.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>: I  concur with everything that my colleague said, and I will not repeat the points  that he made.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Water and Sewerage Services (Amendment) Bill, if  passed, will allow the Department for Regional Development to continue to fund  water and sewerage services, and the Alliance Party has no objection to that.  What is now termed &ldquo;water and sewerage services&rdquo; was for a long time called  public health engineering, and that was for good reason. The biggest  improvement that we, as a nation, have witnessed in public heath came as a  result of the introduction of proper water and sewerage services. Indeed, the  introduction of those services probably made the biggest contribution to  increased length and quality of life. Therefore, it is absolutely critical that  we continue to fund that service appropriately for the future and to ensure  that there is no regression.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Water charges, particularly separate water charges, are  required under the EU water framework directive. That directive not only  requires that separate charges be introduced, but the ethos behind the  directive is that those charges should encourage water conservation. One of the  problems with the previously envisaged structures to levying water charges here  was that they were based on the price of a property, which has no reflection on  the amount of water used. Therefore, water charging in that form does not  fulfil the requirements of the directive. From the perspective of the Alliance  Party, the question is not whether we pay for water but how we pay for water:  charging must be fair, transparent, affordable, and also preferably and,  importantly, it must be linked to usage.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The continuing deferral of water charges has created a  sense among the public that the introduction of charges is not on the agenda.  Therefore, I am glad that the Bill has come to the House, because it  demonstrates that the Executive are not in a position to make the decision to  defer water charges indefinitely at this time and in the current financial  circumstances. I hope that it raises public awareness of the fact that the  debate is ongoing.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">12.30 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The deferral has not, as I had hoped, bought time so that  alternative approaches to levying fair charges could have been considered.  Instead, it has simply put the issue on the back burner to be dealt with at a  later stage, with no particular improvement to the kind of charges that are  envisaged. That is an unfortunate wasted opportunity. As we agree the Second  Stage of the Bill, I hope that work is ongoing in NI Water and in the  Department for Regional Development to look at how charging &mdash; if it has to be  introduced &mdash; is made fair, affordable and transparent and linked to usage. No  one wants to pay taxes, but when we have to pay taxes &mdash; and we all recognise  that we have to fund our public services &mdash; we want to know that those moneys  are being dealt with affordably and accountably.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to raise one other issue, which relates to today&rsquo;s  Adjournment debate: the need for continued investment in water and sewerage  services. We will be discussing the flooding that took place in my constituency  and the investment required to deal with that. No doubt the Minister will be  harangued by many Members at a constituency level for what are seen as the  failings of the Department to deal with those issues. We have to be realistic  and say that, without significant investment in the next five to 10 years, it  is conceivable that the problems that we are experiencing locally will be more  widespread and continue to cause problems.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There are difficult financial decisions ahead. However, we  need to prioritise the issue of water and sewerage. Although it may not be one  of the more glamorous aspects of our work, it is absolutely fundamental to  public health, and it is important to focus investment in that area. As my  colleague has stolen most of my thunder, I am happy to concur with what he has  said and not repeat anything.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Business Committee has agreed to meet immediately upon the  lunchtime suspension. I therefore propose, by leave of the Assembly, to suspend  the sitting until 2.00 pm, when the Minister will conclude and wind up the  debate.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The sitting was suspended at 12.32 pm.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">On resuming (Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr McClarty] in the  Chair) &mdash;</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">2.00 pm</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank  all the Members who commented on the Bill. I welcome the support for the Bill  from the Chairperson and the Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for Regional  Development and from other Members.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am sorry to interrupt the Minister in  full flight, but do we have a quorum in the Chamber?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy  Speaker</strong>: It is obvious from looking around the Chamber that there is not a  quorum.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Notice taken that 10 Members were not present.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">House counted, and there being fewer than 10 Members  present, the Deputy Speaker ordered the Division Bells to be rung.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Upon 10 Members being present &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Minister may continue.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: Go raibh maith agat ar&iacute;s, a LeasCheann Comhairle. It  appears that when Members are speaking to the media, these are important  issues, but when it comes to debating them in the Chamber, they are not so  important as to warrant significant attendance. Nonetheless, as I was saying, I  welcome the support for the Bill from the Chairperson, the Deputy Chairperson  and the members of the Committee for Regional Development and from most, if not  all, parties.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The exception appears to be Mr Gallagher, although I am not  sure whether he indicated that he would be voting against the Bill or whether  his opposition to it means that his party proposes the immediate introduction  of payments for water, because that is the only circumstance in which we would  not need to extend the legislation. The main point of extending the subsidy provision  is to maintain our water and sewerage services on a sound financial basis, and  any other, wider decisions in relation to water and sewerage services will be  taken separately.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Most Members who spoke understood and supported the purpose  of and necessity for the legislation. I look forward to working with the  Committee, along with my officials, during Committee Stage. It was interesting  that some Members referred to the &ldquo;rushed nature&rdquo; and &ldquo;compressed time frame&rdquo;  of the Bill. The Bill is following normal process, so I am not sure where those  concerns arise. The Executive could have sought accelerated passage for the  Bill, but they have brought it forward to allow the Committee to have its full  say in the debate, as is rightly the case. The Committee will arrange its own  timetable and programme of work to accommodate that, and I am grateful to the  Committee for that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to respond to some of the issues that were raised.  Mr Gallagher raised what he termed &ldquo;serious concerns&rdquo;. He alleged that there  had been no debate on the issue, that I was unable to rule out charging for  water, and he asserted that the public were bewildered. If there is  bewilderment among the public, he should examine his own attitude, statements  and record &mdash; and those of his party &mdash; on the issue over the past decade. I could  go into the history and implications of the reform and reinvestment initiative,  which was launched and lauded by his current party leader, Mr Durkan, and by  the former First Minister, David Trimble.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I refer Mr Gallagher to a few points. If he is worried that  a lack of consistency has bewildered the public, I suggest that he look to  himself in the first instance to correct that. He berates me for not ruling  anything out, but the last Finance Minister from his party said in 2002, around  the time that he launched the review of rating and water policy, that:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;nothing has been ruled in and nothing ruled out&hellip;But  we must be under no illusions, as private citizens we pay considerably less in  local taxes than people do in England and, while it may be unpalatable, we may  also have to accept that if we want better public services here we will have to  pay more for them.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">When the Member is looking for consistency when  debating these issues, he should look to himself.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Strangely, when his own party made a submission to that  review, despite what its Finance Minister had said &mdash; it was during a period of  suspension &mdash; the SDLP said that:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;water supply is a basic service&hellip;that we believe  should be guaranteed to all and free at the point of use.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">However, in response to the panel that I  established when I took up office, that party expressed its position as:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;no privatisation, no water-metering, no separate  water charges or double taxation, but water revenue as a clear component of  rates.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In my experience, most of the parties have been quite consistent.  If the public are bewildered because of any lack of consistency on the issue,  the Member may wish to look to his own party to firm up the consistency. In the  past few years, the SDLP seems to have advocated at least three different  positions on the issue.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>: <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I notice that the Member is trying to make comments  from a sedentary position. I am happy to give way if he feels that he has  something intelligent to contribute to the debate. Obviously, he does not.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Gallagher alleged that no debate has taken place on the  issue, and he bemoaned that. He is free, at any stage, to bring a motion to the  House for debate. I have not noticed that he has tabled such a motion. He is  now a member of the Committee for Regional Development, and he is free to raise  the matter through that Committee.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">He must be clear in his facts. Some of his statements were  factually incorrect, which for any Member would be worthy of criticism, but it  is hard to understand how a member of the Regional Development Committee could  be incorrect with their facts. He stated that the Executive had introduced  business charges and that they had implemented them at 100%. Neither part of  that is true. Most non-domestic customers have had water charges for years.  They were not introduced by the present Executive, which unanimously decided to  keep those charges at 50%.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">If Mr Gallagher wishes to assist with what he believes to  be some degree of public confusion, perhaps he should table a debate on the  matter, but he should be sure of his facts and be consistent on his position if  he does so. The Executive, on which his party is represented, unanimously  decided on the issues.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In response to Mr Hamilton, he said that &ldquo;we have a strange  democracy&rdquo; where a party is obliged to take a position in one forum but can  take a different position in another forum. Indeed, it is a strange form of  democracy when the SDLP&rsquo;s representative on the Executive can vote for a  certain position and the party feels free to adopt a completely different  position in the Chamber and in front of the general public. If Mr Gallagher  feels that the public are bewildered, I suggest that he might look to address  that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Gallagher raised a few other points in relation to billing  errors. NIW has taken steps, in consultation with the Consumer Council, to  address that. Improvements to data and to systems are being made in conjunction  with the regulator, and I certainly welcome those. Mr Gallagher also raised the  issue of the draft determination from the regulator that NIW had asked for too  much money. The regulator&rsquo;s document is only a proposal, which is subject to  consultation, and my aim is to ensure proper engagement between the regulator  and Northern Ireland Water to get the right level of resources so that adequate  water and sewerage services can be provided and to make up for the historic  underinvestment in those services.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Brian Wilson said that the legislation was being rushed  through. Given that the normal processes for putting legislation through are  being followed, I am at a loss to see how he can describe the legislation as  being rushed. He spoke for some time about the unfairness that he felt about  different ideas that have perhaps been suggested by him and other parties. I  have certainly not suggested those ideas. He said that alternative means had to  be found, and I waited patiently to hear those. He quickly rattled off a couple  of suggestions to do with using land taxes and green taxes. I have never heard  the sole representative of the Green Party put those ideas forward for debate  on the Floor of the Assembly, and he has never brought those ideas to my  attention. If the Member has ideas on how water and sewerage services should be  funded, I am sure that the Assembly and the Executive will be pleased to hear  them. Two and a half years into the process, the Member has made a few offhand  remarks.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B Wilson</strong>:  I made all of those points during the debate on the Budget in November 2007. At  that time, I called for a review of how local finance should be funded, and I  went into the details of each of those proposals. My concern is that nothing  has been done since then. We have to look at alternative sources of funding.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: The Member&rsquo;s suggestion that nothing has been done is  incorrect. We are doing something now: we are extending the legislation to  allow the Executive to continue to cover the additional costs of water and  sewerage services. That is the third decision that we have taken in relation to  this. When I took office, Sinn F&eacute;in had the position &mdash; similar to those of many  parties, although some of them have wavered back and forth &mdash; of being opposed  to the direct rule propositions on water charging.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">My party opposed privatisation of the Water Service. It  wanted a full inquiry so that the costs that are required for water and  sewerage services can be ascertained and so that a degree of transparency can  be brought to the matter.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Every one of those pledges has been delivered. The  Executive have stopped the direct rule proposition for water charges. They gave  the independent panel a remit that would rule out the privatisation of water  services. They brought forward the panel&rsquo;s report, which continues to be the  subject of debate on all matters that are connected to the requirements for  water and sewerage services.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, if the Member has alternative propositions, I  would certainly be glad to hear from him. If, as he says, the Executive have  done nothing on the matter since the Budget debate in November 2007, I would  not be in the Assembly debating a piece of legislation that would allow us to  continue to do what we have been doing.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Dr Farry and Mrs Long raised a number of wider issues about  water payments, and they pointed out that the Executive have never advocated  double payments for households. The Independent Water Review Panel&rsquo;s proposals addressed  that. The Executive have yet to decide on any methodology for household  payments. As is the case with any other Executive decision, we have a made the  commitment to consult publicly on anything that we do.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, a LeasCheann Comhairle, I trust that I have  dealt with a number of points that were raised in the debate. As I said, I am  somewhat at a loss when Members say that the issues have not been debated; I have  discussed them on many occasions in the Assembly. Of course, Members are free  to table any motion on those matters that they so wish, and I am sure that the  Business Committee would consider the merits of any of those motions for  debate.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Certainly, as I said at the outset, the Bill proposes to  allow the Executive to continue the current funding arrangements. Since they  came into office, the Executive have made two decisions: first, to continue  those arrangements; and secondly, to extend that ability to ensure that the  necessary investment &mdash; which, in many ways, is catch-up investment &mdash; in water  and sewerage services that was not made under direct rule continues to be made.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Of course, the Executive will continue to struggle with all  the financial issues that face us. However, the Bill allows us to continue to  make that subvention to Northern Ireland Water.</p>

      <p class="B3BodyText">There are two groups of amendments, and we will debate the  amendments in each group in turn. The first debate will be on amendment Nos 1  and 2, which extend information-gathering powers to the domestic sector. The  second debate will be on amendment No 3, which provides a minor technical  amendment that is consequential to clause 7 of the Bill.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I remind Members who are intending to speak that, during  the debates on the two groups of amendments, they should address all the  amendments in each particular group on which they wish to comment. Once the  initial debate on each group has been completed, any subsequent amendments in  the group will be moved formally as we go through the Bill, and the Question on  each will be put without further debate.

I stress that this amendment simply  extends a power enabling the details of liable persons to be obtained that is  already available in the current rating legislation but is restricted to  commercial properties, to which unoccupied rating already applies.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Although in the course of its duties Land and Property Services  can request information on the persons entitled to possession, in the absence  of amendment No 1 there will be no statutory recourse if the information is not  provided. The amendment provides a statutory backing for LPS to request the  necessary information and will ensure that the LPS database on empty homes is  as robust as possible. The power needs to apply prior to the rating of empty  homes in order that it can be effectively introduced. That should make billing  and recovery more robust. The absence of the information gathering power prior  to the rating of empty homes being introduced may reduce the revenue &mdash;  estimated at between &pound;6 million and &pound;8 million &mdash; by 50%.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As I have already indicated, this is not a substantive  policy change; rather, it is a minor and technical amendment to extend an  existing power relating to unoccupied property for the purpose of effectively  introducing the rating of empty homes. Amendment No 2 provides that amendment  No 1 will come into operation once Royal Assent is obtained.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  have some little concern about amendment Nos 1 and 2, but the Minister may be  able to allay those. The Bill was granted accelerated passage because of the considerable  delay in the prior process. Given that delay, one would have thought that the  Department would have fully considered its position on all matters relating to  the Bill. I am, therefore, disappointed that amendments have been put forward  only now, after the initial presentation was made to the Committee and after  the Bill had its First Stage and Second Stage readings in the Assembly.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am also disappointed that, when the amendments came  forward, Members were not simultaneously provided with explanations for them.  We had to do some research to find out the nature of the amendments, because  the language used in them is extremely technical. However, I am not so sure  that the effects of them are only technical, as has been described. I thank the  Minister&rsquo;s departmental officials for providing information on the amendments  to Committee members; however, that was done only yesterday.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As the Minister said, amendment No 1 relates to the powers  of the Department to obtain further information on the ownership of vacant  property and the persons to whom it might serve a bill. I am concerned about  the strength of those powers. When the Committee received evidence from the  Minister and his officials, we were given strong assurances that the sharing of  information will benefit the persons about whom the information is obtained by  enabling them to obtain reliefs. However, the amendment is quite different; it  gives the Department strong powers to gather information for billing purposes.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It enables it to serve a notice to the owner of the  property and to a considerable number of bodies, such as district councils,  NIE, BT and other communication and telecommunication providers. I presume that  the serving of a notice puts those bodies under a legal duty to provide any information  that the Department asks for. We are told that that is an extension of powers  that are used in other cases. That may well be so; however, it is a significant  addition to the Bill. Therefore, I am concerned that that amendment was  proposed at a late stage. It is a significant addition to the Bill, and there ought  to have been time for it to have been fully explained to the Committee so that  any concerns that I, or others, may have, could have been allayed.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I had considered proposing a further amendment about the  rating of vacant non-domestic property, which is an issue that I raised with  the Minister. If there is an issue about not bringing in the power to rate  vacant domestic property at this time, the same issue applies to the rating of  vacant non-domestic property. The evidence shows that ratepayers with a  business property that they cannot use because of the economic downturn are  carrying a significant burden as they have to pay rates on that property. That  is something that was introduced only fairly recently. However, no amendment  was necessary, because the power to deal with that is already in the hands of  the Minister. After I spoke during the Second Stage of the Rates (Amendment) Bill,  the Minister said that his Department was conducting an evaluation of the  impact and effectiveness of the policy of rating empty non-domestic properties.  It would be good for the outcome of that evaluation to be made known quickly.  Perhaps the Minister will consider that.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  Thank you, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Unlike Declan, I did not see the amendments  until a few minutes ago. I share some of his concerns. In Committee, Declan  asked questions about the precise nature of the legislation, the gathering of  information, and the sharing of information that would allow people who are in  need of rate relief to better tap into what is available. I have just become  aware of the additions, and, as I said, I share Declan&rsquo;s concerns. Later, I  want to speak about the issue of empty homes.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In common with many other political parties, including the  DUP, Sinn F&eacute;in has raised concerns about the use of accelerated passage.  However, in this case, we were informed that accelerated passage was not only a  necessity but that it was essential to ensure that people, especially those  with small businesses, could get relief. Therefore, we supported it.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In the past, other Committees raised concerns about the use  of accelerated passage. When we supported its use, we found that when we came  to the Assembly, we were berated for daring to take part in a debate when  accelerated passage had already been agreed. That is not a criticism of the  Minister; it is a criticism of the widespread use of accelerated passage. The  Committee agreed to the use of accelerate passage; however, it is difficult to  make a decision when amendments are proposed at such a late stage. Declan said  that he saw the amendments yesterday. I have not been clued in because, as I  said, I saw the amendments only minutes ago.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I think that there is a bit of confusion. The  data-sharing aspect of the Bill, which was designed to benefit pensioners and  those who are eligible for rate relief, and which both Members referred to, is  not in that part of the Bill.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">To that extent, Mr Deputy Speaker, Members have wandered  beyond their remit, dipped under your radar and spoken on matters about which  they should not have spoken. However, I am happy to deal with that confusion.  Although the date for introducing the rating of empty homes has not been decided,  the point of the amendment is to ensure that there will be a level playing  field when it is introduced and that all legal owners of empty homes will be  uniformly subject to the regulations.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Information is available about the owners of non-occupied  commercial premises, and they can be fined if they do not supply the relevant  information. The amendment is technical and will ensure that the same powers  are available in the domestic sector. No Member wants a system in which those  who are wily or who are able to hide property ownership are exempt from a  charge that is being imposed on other people. The point of the amendment is to  ensure that there is equity in the application of the regulation if and when it  comes into force. Once again, I emphasise that we have not decided when the  rating of empty homes will be introduced.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  That is one of the issues that most people have been concerned about. Due to  the Bill&rsquo;s accelerated passage, which we all agreed to, people were concerned  about the non-rating of empty homes. They took into consideration the economic  downturn and the additional pressure that introducing the rating of empty homes  could bring.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Parties have different points of view on the rating of  empty homes. My party raised the issue during a debate a couple of years ago,  which may have started the process. We are concerned that the rating of empty  homes may be an added burden at present, and it is difficult to determine when  the process should start. Thousands of people are being added to the waiting  list for houses every year, and it is possible that some empty homes could be  used to ease that pressure.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">If the rating of empty homes is postponed this year, will  we be in a position to introduce the measure next year or the year after? That  is something that has caught everyone&rsquo;s imagination over the past couple of  years.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: The Member&rsquo;s intervention has made me even more  puzzled. I thought that his original concern was that we were introducing a  power that would enable us to find out who owned empty homes so that we could  impose rates on them.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I will take the intervention in a minute.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">From the Member&rsquo;s latest intervention, and I am quite happy  for him to make himself clear in a moment or two, it seems that he is concerned  that we are not introducing the rating of empty homes quickly enough, and that  the measure is needed because so many people are on the waiting list for  houses. If he wants the rating of empty homes to be introduced quickly, he can  make that point when we review the situation and the Committee expresses its  view.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to make it clear to the Member that the power that  the Department is seeking, through the amendment, is to ensure that when the  rating of empty homes is introduced, the very point he has made can be  facilitated. There will be a financial obligation on the owners of empty houses  to pay rates on their properties, which will, hopefully, encourage them to put  such properties on the market. I thought that the Member would have welcomed  that change instead of being critical of it.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">2.30 pm</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. We would welcome that. We pointed  out at the Committee that we reluctantly agreed to the empty homes amendment  because of the economic downturn. I just had a glance at the additional  amendments that came through this morning. The amendments that I was speaking  about were additional legislation that would allow people to move away from  tapping into their rates relief and allow them to expand that into other pieces  of information. I was talking about two completely different things.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to rating empty homes, Sinn F&eacute;in has argued for  a considerable period that the sooner it is introduced the better.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I hope that you understood that, Mr Deputy Speaker.  I assure the Member that the amendment &mdash; and it is a technical amendment &mdash; is  to ensure that if and when the rating of empty homes is introduced, LPS has the  same powers as it has for commercial properties; that it can trace the owner  and know to whom to send the bill. That creates a level playing field, and  Members should welcome that.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  Declan O&rsquo;Loan said that it would have been better if we had had this  information earlier. I received information about the amendments on my computer  about half an hour ago. It is difficult to prepare for a debate when one is fed  amendments only at the last minute.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I made it clear that I would rather not see Bills  introduced by accelerated passage. I will endeavour to ensure that that does  not happen, although this was beyond my control. Indeed, the Member might be  more easily able than I to upbraid those who were responsible.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I made officials available to brief the Committee. This was  not a last-minute panic measure. The amendment was identified earlier in the  process, but it could not be introduced earlier due to the fact that the Bill  had been approved by the Executive. Therefore, this was the only stage at which  the amendment could have been introduced without again going through the  process of getting an amended Bill approved by the Executive.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr O&rsquo;Loan raised the issue of rates on empty commercial properties  and the fact that the Department said that it would evaluate the impact and  effectiveness of the policy of rating empty non-domestic properties. That  evaluation was always planned, and it has, as Mr O&rsquo;Loan pointed out, been given  added importance due to the effect of the recession on the commercial market.  As part of that evaluation, the Department is taking soundings from  stakeholders to get their views on the effect of the policy. I will take on  board those views, as well as the views of the Committee for Finance and  Personnel. I want to consider all factors in order to have a detailed analysis  before the Department decides how best to proceed.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  The Minister did not come back to me with an explanation of why the amendments  were brought forward so late. They were entered no later than last Thursday. My  party staff made enquiries on Friday and got good verbal explanations from  departmental officials. The Committee, through its secretariat, was informed only  yesterday, when members were given a full written explanation of the  amendments. When one gets complex amendments like this, it causes the Committee  concern if we do not simultaneously have a clear explanation in language that  we can understand of what the amendments are about.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Given the long delay in bringing the Bill forward, I find  it surprising that all the issues were not covered, that those amendments were  not in the Bill when it was presented to the Assembly at its First Stage, and  were not then explained in full to the Committee when it was briefed by  departmental officials and the Minister himself.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I thought that I had provided an explanation. The  Bill had already been approved by the Executive and could not be amended.  Amendments cannot be made and published until after the Bill&rsquo;s Second Stage. As  the Member knows, the Second Stage took place late on Tuesday evening or early  on Wednesday morning; I cannot remember exactly when it was passed. Therefore,  the amendments were tabled as soon as possible thereafter. We did move quickly.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Member makes a good point. The amendments are technical  rather than complex, and I hope that I have at least explained the rationale  behind them. The powers that are already available for commercial properties will  now be available for domestic properties. Information must be provided to show  who owns a property. If that information is not provided, sanctions can be  imposed, including a fine of up to &pound;1,000. That is the explanation of the  amendment. I hope that I have explained the reason behind it, which is one of  fairness and equality.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Although there would have been a longer discussion had the  Bill undergone a Committee Stage, I am, nevertheless, happy to explain the  thinking behind it in this format. I hope that I have explained why the tabling  of the amendments was delayed until last Thursday. That is part of the  arrangements in the House for tabling amendments. Therefore, they could not  have been tabled any sooner.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  In case the Minister is worrying, which I am sure he is, I will explain the  reasons why the Ulster Unionist Party will make no interventions during the  Consideration Stage. Although we sympathise with Members&rsquo; points, we are  content, as we have said since the start, to allow the Bill to proceed.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I wonder whether I could have the Minister&rsquo;s attention. I  raised the issue of carers with him. I want to take the opportunity to thank  him and his officials for the manner in which they have dealt with the issue of  carers in relation to the introduction that I had to this Bill, particularly  with regard to rates relief for carers. I met his officials, and I am satisfied  that, as a result of my requests in the House and at the Committee, we may be &mdash;  I will put it no stronger than that &mdash; able to find a way to determine whether  there is a way to address that issue. I want to put on record that I am  grateful for all the assistance that I have received.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I thank the Member for his gracious intervention. I  am sure that he will not make a habit of it. I thought that he perhaps wanted  to intervene again to ensure that I did not get the wrong end of the stick.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  He wants me to repeat it again and again; do not get carried away.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I will not get carried away. I will take such a  gracious intervention when it is available, because I know that it will always  be tempered with other kinds of intervention and speeches on other occasions. I  had made a promise &mdash; I know that we are wandering off the subject &mdash; that  officials would meet the Member, and I am glad that it was a useful and  productive meeting.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Moreover, I am also glad to receive assurance from the  Member about the Ulster Unionist Party&rsquo;s support for this important measure,  which many people outside the Assembly want to be introduced. That is one  reason why Members from all parties agreed to accelerated passage.</p>

      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: We now come to the second group of amendments for debate. There is  only one amendment, amendment No 3, which provides a minor technical amendment  that is consequential to clause 7.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I beg to move amendment No 3: In page 14, line 20,  at end insert</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;4A. In Article 52 (procedure on appeal to  Commissioner), in paragraph (4A)(b), for the words from &lsquo;12(1)&rsquo; to the end  substitute &rsquo;15 of Part 1 of Schedule 12 (subject to paragraphs 7(3) and 12)&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Members may wish to note that the amendment is minor and  technical in nature and is consequential on the new anti-avoidance powers that  are set out in clause 7.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It will help if I first provide an overview of clause 7,  which is intended to address measures that ratepayers may take to avoid  liability through deliberately damaging property or by disregarding any changes  that have an effect on its valuation for a certain period.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 7 will enable my Department, by regulations, to  amend the valuation assumptions that apply to domestic property. It also  contains a power to include additional matters in regulations, including  assumptions that changes have been made to the state of the property in  comparison with an earlier time.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Article 52(4)(a) and (b) of the Rates (Northern Ireland)  Order 1977 provides that, where the Commissioner of Valuation for Northern  Ireland makes an alteration in the valuation list, he may alter the valuation  of any comparable property, having regard to the valuation assumptions. It will  therefore be necessary, in respect of that, to take account of any changes to  the valuation assumptions provided for in clause 7 where the property is an  empty home. Amendment No 3 gives effect to that.</p>

      <p class="B3BodyText">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. The motion  will give Members some indication of the remit and range of the work of the  Public Accounts Committee. I will not go into detail on every item listed in  the motion, but I will remind Members of the scope of the Committee&rsquo;s work.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Public Accounts Committee is a Standing Committee that  considers reports on accounts laid before the Assembly. The accounts of all  Departments and of most public sector bodies are prepared and laid before the  Assembly by the Comptroller and Auditor General, the head of the Audit Office.  The Comptroller and Auditor General may also make value-for-money reports, as  well as reports of investigations that his office carries out as a result of  audit findings.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Audit Office&rsquo;s role is to examine public expenditure  closely from the position of the independence of government. As such, it  performs a natural partnership function with the Assembly, assisting in its  scrutiny role and complementing its systems of checks and balances, which are  fundamental to a healthy democracy. Audit Office reports are an invaluable tool  in enabling the Public Accounts Committee to improve accountability and good  governance in the public sector.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I commend the Audit Office for the excellent support that  it provides to the Committee. I also thank the Committee Clerk and her staff,  who work very hard every week to make members&rsquo; deliberations easier. There have  been some changes in the Clerk&rsquo;s team, but the secretariat staff have worked  very hard to ensure that those changes were seamless. The Committee thanks all  the clerical staff and the secretariat.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee has welcomed a new Comptroller and Auditor  General this year in Kieran Donnelly &mdash; Comhghairdeas le Kieran. Congratulations  to Kieran on his successful application for the role. He has already established  a good working relationship with the Committee, which is to his credit. The  Committee also thanks John Dowdall, the previous Comptroller and Auditor  General, for his mentoring. He gave us many good years.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee has worked again this year to improve standards  in public life, stewardship of the public purse, financial governance systems,  and processes and controls to maintain accountability and value for the  taxpayer. In each of its inquiries, the Committee endeavours to identify key  shortcomings and to recommend improvements for future practice, continually  promoting learning in public spending. Those lessons are particularly relevant in  the current climate of recession.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As in the past year, the Committee addressed some of its  business into composite reports, which examined by correspondence certain  issues of concern. Those have been circulated to Members, who will be familiar  with the contents. The Committee also selected Audit Office reports to deal  with as a priority, using the order of expenditure, impact on the taxpayer, and  the extent to which lessons could be learned as selection criteria. The  Committee studied those reports in detail, and heard evidence from the  accounting officers of the relevant spending bodies, and probed and dissected  all the evidence in order to come to its conclusions.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I will particularly focus on two reports: the Committee&rsquo;s  &lsquo;Report on Statement of Rate Levy and Collection 2006-07&rsquo;, and the &lsquo;Report on  Brangam, Bagnall &amp; Co: Legal Practitioner Fraud Perpetrated Against the  Health and Personal Social Services&rsquo;.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">George Brangam, solicitor and owner of the legal practice  Brangam Bagnall and Co, was found to have fraudulently extracted at least  &pound;278,000, over a period of seven years, from six of the 11 health bodies to which  his practice provided legal services. Public sector fraud is always a headline  issue for the Committee. The Committee was relieved that the Department  recovered money and legal costs of &pound;123,000 in full. Nevertheless, on behalf of  the Committee, I reiterate the gravity of the case.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Fraud is an abuse of position and trust, and no level of  fraud is acceptable. Systems and controls, no matter how simple, must be in  place to prevent anyone from deceiving the taxpayer in such a way. The Brangam  case was particularly frustrating because the fraud could have been prevented  and detected easily through basic payment checks. Unfortunately, the checks and  supervisions were dispensed with because the health bodies were working with a  professional person: a lawyer who had previously been a colleague.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Information sharing is another area in which lessons should  be learned from the case. The Committee repeatedly recommends that Government  must create a culture of openness in which employees are encouraged to flag up  non-compliance with controls and to identify problems early on. Allegations  about the solicitor&rsquo;s conduct, behaviour and probity were not shared with the  Health Service. The Committee was not satisfied with the Department&rsquo;s handling  of the solicitor&rsquo;s departure from the Health Service, particularly with regard  to the conflict of interest arising from his involvement in the procurement of  legal services. That was a factor in the Committee&rsquo;s conclusion that it had  never before seen an example of such poor procurement practices.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee also challenged the adequacy of the  Department&rsquo;s investigation into the fraud, and it made a number of  recommendations for the scope and terms of reference of future forensic  investigations. The Committee gained a broad understanding of the implications  of the case by seeking the additional perspective of the Law Society in its  capacity as a regulatory body of legal practitioners. In December 2008, the  Committee heard evidence from the Law Society and the accounting officer of the  Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety before making its  recommendations.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee agrees that the Department has reduced risk  to the Health Service by transferring most legal advice to an internal health  and social care directorate. The Department has also introduced new procedures  that do not permit cheques in settlement of legal cases to be channelled  through solicitors where there is no sensible business case to do so. Those  procedures would have prevented the majority of frauds perpetrated by George  Brangam if they had been in place. The Committee remains of the view that the  Department must learn lessons from the case for future forensic investigations  and ensure that there are no conflicts of interest among the personnel who are  responsible for the procurement of services.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Health Service is, arguably, the priority for  taxpayers. For good reason, it receives the bulk of the local Budget. As a  constituency politician from the vibrant but deprived area of West   Belfast, I deem this report to be the most significant of the year  because it deals with prolonged and systematic malpractice in the most crucial  and cherished front line public services that are offered here. As Chairperson,  I have no doubt that the Committee&rsquo;s inquiry has strengthened public service  for the benefit of taxpayers in every constituency.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I now turn briefly to another inquiry that has significant  implications for every taxpayer. In the &lsquo;Report on Statement of Rate Levy and  Collection 2006-07&rsquo;, the Comptroller and Auditor General was unable to give the  Assembly any assurance on Land and Property Services&rsquo; assessment and collection  of rates in that year. That was due to significant system control problems that  arose following the introduction of a new IT system.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee decided to prioritise the topic because of  the considerable impact of rates revenue, which is assessed at &pound;1 billion a  year, on local and central government. The Committee reported on rate  collection activity during a time of considerable change in policy, systems and  management structures. We considered that the Department of Finance and  Personnel and the agency were trying to do too much in too little time.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">On 1 April 2007, domestic rates bills were issued under a  completely new regime. For the first time, annual rates bills were based on a  home&rsquo;s estimated selling price rather than on rental values that were  determined some 30 years previously, as had been the case for many years. A new  computer system was installed in October 2006 to process bills based on the new  policy. However, as new policy and new computer systems were being introduced,  senior management and staff were handling the additional challenge of setting  up a new agency.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Land and Property Services was created by merging four  existing agencies &mdash; the Rate Collection Agency, the Valuation and Lands Agency,  Ordnance Survey and Land Registers &mdash; over a two-year period. The Committee&rsquo;s  overall conclusion was that the implementation of the new IT system was poorly  managed and resulted in significant additional costs being incurred to resolve basic  failings in the system that had not been discovered before it went live.  Members found it hard to believe that short cuts were being taken to implement  a complex and large IT system and that staff were transferred from operational  duties to ensure that the system went live on time.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee considered that the decision to proceed with  the implementation of the new system was based on a fundamentally flawed risk  assessment. The Department did not take sufficient account of the huge risk of  inadequate system testing, the impact of transferring front line staff to work  on the introduction of rates reforms and the enormous financial consequences of  postponing the collection of arrears.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">On the subject of arrears, the Committee noted that  ratepayer debt rose from &pound;48 million in 2006 to &pound;124 million in 2008 as a  result of the decision to delay the recovery of arrears. That financial impact  had been significantly underestimated in the Department&rsquo;s plan. Although the  Department achieved its objective of successfully calculating and issuing bills  based on capital values by April 2007, that did not provide either central  government or local government with any additional revenue.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">New reforms may have led to a fairer allocation of rates,  with some ratepayers paying less and others paying more, and various reliefs  and allowances, such as the lone pensioner allowance, were introduced for those  in great need. Nevertheless, the Committee&rsquo;s view was that a properly  considered risk assessment would have avoided many of the problems that were  encountered, by postponing the reforms by one year.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee made a number of important recommendations  for the Department and Land and Property Services to ensure that what went  wrong will be fixed and that the resulting adverse consequences to ratepayers,  councils and staff can be quickly resolved. The Committee also noted wider  lessons on implementing complex new IT systems. Many of the lessons are already  incorporated in best practice, but the mistakes seem to be repeated time and  again by civil servants. In the Department&rsquo;s memorandum of response issued in January  2009, the Department accepted the Committee&rsquo;s recommendations and advised that  a financial review was being carried out by Land and Property Services to  ensure that all outstanding system problems would be addressed.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee continues to monitor progress, and I believe  that the Deputy Chairperson, Roy Beggs, may discuss recent updates regarding  some of the reports. I am glad of the opportunity to present to the Assembly  the work of the busy and dedicated Public Accounts Committee. I appreciate that  we have little time before Question Time, but I know that the debate will  continue after that. Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Members will be aware that questions to the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment will start at 3.00 pm. Members can take their ease until that time.  The debate will resume at 3.30 pm, when the first Member to be called to speak  will be Mr Jonathan Craig.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">3.00 pm</p>
      <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Dallat] in the Chair)</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenAnswersHeading"><a name="7"></a>Oral Answers to Questions</p>
      <p class="H3SectionHeading">Enterprise,  Trade And Investment</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Question 1 has been withdrawn.</p>
      <p class="H5StageHeading">Unemployment: Economic Strategy</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">2. <strong>Mr  O&rsquo;Loan </strong>asked the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment, given that  the latest labour market figures released by her Department show an increase in  unemployment of 1,600 people last month, for her assessment of the need to  reassess the economic strategy in order &ldquo;to grow a dynamic, innovative  economy&rdquo;.&nbsp; (AQO 121/10<a name="AQO12110"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (Mrs Foster)</strong>: I  acknowledge the impact of the increase in unemployment on many families in Northern Ireland.  As with other parts of the United Kingdom,  Northern Ireland  continues to feel the effects of the global recession.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">However, it is important to stress that the pace of the  downturn appears to be lessening. The 1,600 increase in the number of  claimants, for example, to which the Member&rsquo;s question refers, is among the  lowest in the past year. Furthermore, the Executive and my Department have  taken specific steps in an effort to limit the short-term impact of the  downturn on people and businesses: last year, the Executive announced a &pound;44&middot;5  million package; Invest Northern Ireland hosted credit crunch seminars; a &pound;5  million accelerated support fund aimed at providing fast-track support to  client companies was set up; and a &pound;15 million short-term aid scheme is  available to Invest Northern Ireland client companies and the wider business  community.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is also important for the medium to long term that we  remain focused on the economic goals outlined in the Programme for Government.  We must grow a more dynamic and innovative private sector; otherwise the short-term  increases in unemployment could become more structural and long term. I will  give careful consideration to the findings of the independent review of  economic policy. I commissioned the review in December 2008, and it was  published earlier today. In particular, I note that the review panel endorsed  the economic goals that the Executive have identified in the Programme for  Government.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  Even if, as I hope, we emerge from the recession, all indications are that  unemployment will continue to rise. The Minister&rsquo;s colleague the Minister of  Finance and Personnel has made it clear that his Budget for next year is in  serious trouble. In the past few days, details have been emerging of the  Barnett report on Invest Northern Ireland. It suggests that Invest  Northern Ireland does not deliver jobs in the way that we expect it and need it  to do. In light of those facts, will the Minister support my call for a full  revision of the Budget? Will she use SDLP documents as the basis for that  revision?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: What the Member presents as facts are, of course, not facts. To  take account of changing circumstances and ensure that we are focused on  addressing the key challenges, the Executive are committed to an ongoing review  and the necessary revision of the Programme for Government. I set up a panel to  carry out an independent review of Invest Northern Ireland and the Government&rsquo;s wider  economic policy. I ask the Member to accept that the Barnett review pointed out  that the Executive were right to make the economy their number one priority.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">After much media spin on the review from certain quarters,  it is important to set the record straight. The report is balanced; it contains  some criticism, but that criticism is constructive. Page 6 of the Barnett  report states:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Invest Northern Ireland has contributed  significantly to NI&rsquo;s economic performance in terms of employment growth.  Offers of assistance through SFA were associated with 28,000 new jobs, 15,000  safeguarded jobs and &pound;2&middot;4 bn of investment over the period 2002/03-2007/08&rdquo;.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is simply wrong, therefore, for commentators and Members  to say that &pound;1 billion was wasted in that period. Are they saying that they did  not want those 28,000 jobs? I do not think so, because Members consistently ask  me what I am doing to safeguard jobs in their constituency or to bring new jobs  there.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Very rarely in this House do I hear talk of closing the  productivity gap. The report rightly looks at the issue of closing the  productivity gap, which I am committed to doing. However, if that is what this  House wants us to do, then there are choices that have to be made. There is no  point in Members coming to this House and saying that they want Invest Northern  Ireland to bring low-paid jobs to their constituencies if, when they next come  to the Assembly, they criticise Invest Northern Ireland for doing exactly what  they asked it to do.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There is a job of work to be done in relation to the  report. I am content to look at the report and to take it forward, and I hope  that Members will do it the justice of reading it in its entirety.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McFarland</strong>:  In light of the economic downturn, the Department recently introduced a  short-term aid scheme for businesses. Will the Minister advise us of the actual  take-up by businesses, rather than the number of applications? In other words,  how successful has the scheme been so far?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: The short-term aid scheme has been successful. I am quite happy  to write to the Member with the specific details. To date, I think that  somewhere in the region of 18 companies have taken up the scheme. Yesterday,  when I met employees of Stream International from the city of Londonderry, I  told them that one of the ideas that we are considering to help that company is  the short-term aid scheme, so that the company can retain the skills and the  management that are required to keep it going in the short term. The short-term  aid scheme has been an incredibly useful tool to have in the armoury of Invest Northern  Ireland,  and I will follow up with the specific details for the Member.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Neeson</strong>: I  am glad that the Barnett review has been published. I very much regret that it  was not seen by the members of the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment before it  went to the press, but I know that the Minister had no control over that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">How does the Minister intend to respond to the Barnett  review? How does she respond to the suggestion that the Department of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment and the Department for Employment and Learning  should merge?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment: </strong>In respect of  the first part of the question, I intend to have a very focused period of  consultation &mdash; probably in the region of six weeks &mdash; so that I can hear what  the community and interested parties have to say about the content of the  review. It is important to do that. It is more than likely that I will then  make a statement to this House and take the matter to the Executive, because a  large number of issues in the review are cross-cutting. The Member mentioned  one of them: the recommendation that we should have a Department of the economy  instead of having the Department for Employment and Learning and the Department  of Enterprise, Trade and Investment.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">From a political point of view, it should come as no  surprise to Members that I very strongly support that recommendation. We  believe that there is a need to cut the number of Government Departments. We  believe that that would be efficiency in government, which is what people want  to see us doing in this place. We should cut the number of MLAs and the number  of Government Departments, so, from a political point of view, I wholeheartedly  support that recommendation. However, I will of course listen to the views of  others in relation to the consultation, and I will take it to the Executive in  the near future for discussion.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member who was due to ask question 3 is not in her place, and  question 4 has been withdrawn.</p>
      <p class="H5StageHeading">10-day Payment Rule</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">5. <strong>Mr P J  Bradley </strong>asked the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment what  discussions her Department has had with the Department of Finance and Personnel  to ensure that a greater percentage of small sub-contractors, employed to  service large Government contracts, benefit from the ten-day payment rule  adopted by Departments.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO  124/10<a name="AQO12410"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment:</strong> The Department of Enterprise,  Trade and Investment (DETI) has not been in discussion with the Department of  Finance and Personnel about the matter. However, I have raised concerns with  the Minister of Finance and Personnel. At the request of the Finance Minister,  contracting authorities are encouraged to pay suppliers within 10 days of the  receipt of a valid invoice. However, that is not a contractual requirement. The  Minister of Finance and Personnel advised that in the case of  construction-related works and services contracts that are procured throughout  his Department, the contracting authority is required to pay main contractors  within a maximum of 24 days from the receipt of a valid invoice. Subcontracts  include terms that complement the main contract.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">For non-construction related contracts for supplies and  services, the payment of all sums that are due to be paid by the main contractor  to subcontractors is required within a specified period that does not exceed 30  days from the receipt of a valid invoice. I am advised that the Department of  Finance and Personnel will keep payment terms in contracts under review.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P J Bradley</strong>:  Will the Minister undertake to give more help to local businesses to enable  them to compete for large tenders? I give the recent Invest Northern Ireland  advertising contract as an example.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment:</strong> After an open procurement  exercise, that contract was awarded to the person that complied with the  contract tender. I regret that the Member was not in his seat to hear me when I  talked about public procurement this morning. However, public procurement is  one of those areas in which Government can help a lot. We have seen InterTradeIreland  introduce the Go-2-Tender programme, which has been successful in helping a  number of companies in Northern Ireland  secure Republic   of Ireland Government  contracts. We should welcome very much the work that InterTradeIreland is doing  in that regard.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Small companies that I visit raise the issue of public  procurement with me. The fact that sometimes there is a ceiling on the amount  of money in turnover that those companies must have before they can apply for  Government procurement contracts is an issue about which I wrote to the Finance  Minister last week, because it was mentioned when I visited a company.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I know that the Committee for Finance and Personnel is  conducting an inquiry into public procurement, but it is an area on which we  must keep a close eye so that our small businesses get access to it. We know  that 82% of Northern Ireland  businesses are small or medium in size. We need to tell them that there is a  route into Government procurement. On that, I agree with the Member  wholeheartedly.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>:  Will the Minister tell us how her Department&rsquo;s performance compares with that  of others in meeting that 10-day payment target? Will she tell us whether that  performance has been improving or worsening over recent months?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment:</strong> I am glad to say  that DETI is one of the better payers in Government. Around 88% of its invoices  are paid within 10 working days each month. One may say that that is all very good  for DETI, but it is important that my Department shows a lead. I am pleased to  say that it is doing so. Our non-departmental public bodies pay 73% of invoices  within the 10-day target. The performance of those public bodies is improving  monthly, and it is something that we are watching.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Given that she emphasised the need  for small and medium-sized businesses and the social economy sector to have  equal access to public procurement contracts, what input has the Minister&rsquo;s  Department had into the Committee for Finance and Personnel&rsquo;s inquiry?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: I do not have that information to hand, but I want to  contribute to the Committee&rsquo;s investigation. As I said in answer to an earlier  question, public procurement is a recurring theme in my visits to companies,  particularly those in the construction sector, which often question why they  cannot get access to Northern Ireland Water or other contracts.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">My Department and Invest Northern Ireland organised a successful event at the new South West   Acute Hospital  in Enniskillen, during which we introduced a number of small suppliers to the  principal contractor on the site. That worked well, and we will consider  repeating that in other large scale contracts.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Robert  Coulter</strong>: Are all Departments co-operating actively in applying the 10-day  payment rule?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: As far as I am aware, all the Departments are being monitored  against the 10-day payment target. I recall seeing a table that listed all the  Departments and the percentage of payments that they make within 10 days. I am  sure that table will be made available to the Member if he asks for it.</p>
      <p class="H5StageHeading">Renewable Energy: Feed-In Tariff</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">6. <strong>Mr B Wilson </strong>asked the  Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment if she has any plans to introduce  the feed-in tariff for renewable energy to encourage the development of the  renewable sector.&nbsp; (AQO 125/10<a name="AQO12510"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment</strong>: There are no  immediate plans to change the Northern    Ireland renewables obligation (NIRO) from  being the main support mechanism for encouraging renewables development.  However, DETI is about to publish a consultation on changes to the NIRO to  ensure its consistency with the GB obligations. That consultation will seek  initial views on the feed-in tariff as an alternative mechanism. However, any  proposal to introduce a feed-in tariff needs more detailed assessment and  consultation and, if agreed, would require changes to both primary and  subordinate legislation.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B Wilson</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her response, although I find it disappointing.  Feed-in tariffs have been very successful in Europe,  and, in many European countries, they have led to a big increase in the number of  renewable systems. Next year, the UK will introduce feed-in tariffs,  so we should follow suit. Will the Minister look at what the UK Government are  doing and consider implementing those measures here?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment:</strong> That is another subject that we discussed in the House this  morning, and I explained why we are different from the rest of the United Kingdom  in that respect. Feed-in tariffs for small-scale renewables were not in the Westminster legislation,  although the House of Lords tabled an amendment to include such tariffs in  legislation. Unfortunately, because there was not enough time to bring a  legislative consent motion to this House, we were unable to be included in that  legislation. That is why there is a disparity between us and the rest of the United Kingdom.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">This Friday, I will launch a consultation process on how we  should incentivise small-scale and other renewables, and as part of that  process we will discuss feed-in tariffs. However, the Member must be aware that  if, after consultation and discussion, we intend to go down that road, primary  and secondary legislation will be required. In the meantime, there are other  ways of incentivising the renewables sector. As I said, the consultation  process will be launched on Friday.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I am sure that the Minister will join me in welcoming the success of SeaGen&rsquo;s  marine current turbine project in Strangford Lough. Given the additional boost  to our economy that can come through developing renewable technologies, such as  the SeaGen project, what support is the Minister&rsquo;s Department giving to the development  of offshore renewable energy generating technology for wind and wave power?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment:</strong> That is a matter of awarding various bands of Northern Ireland  renewables obligation (NIRO) certificates; the higher the band, the more  valuable it is. Therefore, we have been looking at ways of incentivising newer  energies, such as those to which the Member referred.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">This is an exciting time for energy policy in Northern Ireland.  The strategic energy framework is out for consultation, which will close soon.  We also have the bioenergy consultation process. That is going on at a time of  flux for energy policy. In addition, we are carrying out a strategic  environmental assessment of tidal energy off the north Antrim coast. A great  deal is going on with respect to energy policy, but we must do all of that if  we want to be a key player in the area. I am confident that Members will play  their part in developing the policy.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Maskey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. What progress have we made on the  renewable energy targets in the draft strategic energy framework, and are they  still achievable?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment:</strong> The consultation  on the strategic energy framework has not yet closed. Nevertheless, the Member  is right: the 40% target in the framework is challenging; however, in order to  meet our renewable energy commitments, I felt that it needed to be included.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the fact that the Minister of the Environment delayed  the publication of the supplementary planning guidance on planning policy  statement 18 until we were able to assess whether that should be the target and  until we had a detailed assessment of its potential effect on wind-turbine  development. That is an example of joined-up Government. After we have looked  at the 40% target, it is important that we consider its implications on  electricity prices, which, as the Member will know, is an important issue, and  on our medium to long-term energy mix, security of supply and competitiveness.  Those matters are also of keen importance. I want to look at the consultation  responses, and we will do so in the near future.</p>
      <p class="H5StageHeading">Renewable Energy: Targets</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">7. <strong>Mr  Easton </strong>asked the Minister of Enterprise,  Trade and Investment what assistance is available to help businesses meet the  renewable energy targets set out in the draft strategic energy framework.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO 126/10<a name="AQO12610"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment:</strong> As I said, the  most significant target in the strategic energy framework is to increase the  amount of electricity from renewable sources to 40% by 2020. The primary source  of financial assistance to developers whose renewable energy businesses will  contribute to this challenging target is the Northern Ireland renewables  obligation.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly voted for increased assistance under the NIRO  for newer renewable technologies in the banding of the NIRO, which was brought  in on 1 April 2009. I have also ensured that the Northern   Ireland landfill gas developments are maintained at one  renewables obligation certificate per megawatt hour, unlike elsewhere in the United Kingdom.  That is a clear case of devolution delivering for Northern Ireland. The draft  strategic energy framework highlights the significant potential to generate  increased economic opportunities from sustainable energy activities in Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As an example of how the Government are helping businesses  to make the most of those economic opportunities, Invest NI is hosting a Northern Ireland  energy and environment conference in the Waterfront Hall on 14 October. The  event will cover real business opportunities in wind, marine, bioenergy and  other low-carbon technologies, giving businesses access to the Crown Estate,  and the European Union water and United Nations procurement programmes. Invest Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  strategy for the renewables sector also includes a range of initiatives that is  aimed at increasing the deployment of sustainable technologies and improving  energy efficiency, including direct business support provided by the Carbon  Trust.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>:  What is Invest Northern Ireland  doing directly to help local businesses that are interested in the development  of sustainable energy?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment</strong>: Invest NI has taken on board the views of  the green new deal group, which, as Members know, issued a report some months  ago. The group wants to take up the opportunities provided by the green new  deal, grasp them and take them forward. It has chaired the economic  opportunities subgroup of the interdepartmental working group on sustainable  energy. That working group specifically examines the opportunities to create green  jobs and skilled development in Northern    Ireland, with the aim of developing and  agreeing an action plan among the relevant Departments by the end of December 2009.  That section of Invest NI is examining renewable energy. It is important that  that is done because there are great opportunities in that area.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  Will the Minister inform the House what discussions are ongoing with regard to  developing the Northern Ireland Civil Service estate as a major renewable  energy user? If there are no such discussions, will she encourage them to take  place?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment:</strong> Discussions are  ongoing on that issue. In an earlier answer on the 10-day payment rule, I said  that it is important that the Government lead, and the interdepartmental  working group on sustainable energy includes repre&shy;sentatives from across  Government, who feed back into their own Departments. It is important that we  hear from the government estate, especially from the Departments that own a lot  of property, such as the Department of Health, Social Services and Public  Safety, the Department of Education and the Department for Regional  Development. We need to know what they believe to be the best way forward. In  the Department for Employment and Learning, much work has been done in some  colleges of further education. The Omagh campus of the South West College has carried out much work on  renewable energy, and that work was done in an exemplary way.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for her  responses so far on the assistance that is available to businesses, which I  want her to broaden. I know that she has been active and vigorous in local  areas. I met her in my constituency because she was involved in a job creation  project.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Has the Minister discussed the possibility of reducing rates  on non-domestic vacant properties with the Minister of Finance and Personnel?  That would help smaller businesses to reduce their current excruciating  overheads.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment:</strong> We have not  discussed that issue. However, to increase the energy efficiency of small  companies and to decrease their energy bills, the Department puts a large  amount of funding into the Carbon Trust, which visits companies and advises  them what to do. In some instances, the change has been dramatic. Some large  companies have saved about 17% on their energy bills because of the  intervention of the Carbon Trust.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I urge small companies that are having difficulties with  their energy bills, and I am sure that there are many, to consult the Carbon  Trust. The organisation is willing to talk.</p>
      <p class="H5StageHeading">Signature Projects</p>
      <p class="OralWrittenQuestion">8. <strong>Mr  Doherty </strong>asked the Minister of Enterprise,  Trade and Investment for an update on the five signature projects and if all  five will be delivered on target.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (AQO  127/10<a name="AQO12710"></a>)</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment:</strong> In the Walled   City signature project,  which is now in phase 2, the culture and animation programme is complete. The  Playhouse project is complete, and the theatre is due to be officially opened  in autumn 2009. Contractors will be appointed at the end of October 2009 for St  Columb&rsquo;s Cathedral and the First Derry Presbyterian Church projects.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In the Apprentice Boys of Derry Memorial Hall project, the  needs and costs involved to appoint a project manager have been assessed and  evaluated and a detailed business case has been completed. That is currently  being considered and the outcome will be communicated to all concerned in due  course. The Northern Ireland Tourist Board remains supportive of this project  and is keen to see it proceed.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">An economic appraisal of the Guildhall project is under  way, and the lighting strategy and Aras Colmcille projects have been  economically appraised. The latter is completing the interpretative plan to  meet the Heritage Lottery Fund&rsquo;s requirements for funding.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Giants Causeway visitor centre economic appraisal has  been completed. A number of minor queries are being addressed by the Tourist  Board. Subject to necessary approvals, it is hoped that a letter of offer will  be issued in December 2009 and the project is expected to be delivered by  spring 2012.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">For the Mournes signature project, St Patrick&rsquo;s signature  project, and the Causeway signature project, excluding the visitor centre, 74  successful applications are going through the economic appraisal process. The  Tourist Board has been working on those with the Northern Ireland Environment  Agency, the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development and the Planning  Service.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">On 27 November 2008, the Executive confirmed support of up  to &pound;43&middot;5 million for the Titanic signature project, subject to satisfaction of  certain conditions. The project is at an advanced stage of consideration.  Harcourt Construction continues to work on site at risk, with the secant piling  complete for the basement walls, the excavation complete for the signature  building, and the piling for the signature foundations having commenced.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Doherty</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for her  detailed and lengthy answer. Given the potential of the Sperrins region for  activities such as hillwalking, does the Minister have any plans to invest in  that area with a view to making it a signature project?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: It will not surprise the Member to know that I would have  preferred it had a certain area in Fermanagh been considered for a signature  project as well. The signature projects were awarded before I came into this  office, so I am playing the hand I was dealt. However, the new tourism strategy  for Northern Ireland will be  issued at the end of this month or the beginning of next month, and I am very  hopeful that we will see the way forward for Northern Ireland tourism in that,  as well as the importance of the five signature projects.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The tourism development scheme has attracted two  applications from the Omagh District Council area in West Tyrone. One relates  to An Creag&aacute;n team-building facility: the project cost is in the region of  &pound;65,000 and the grant sought is half of that at &pound;32,500. The other project in  the Member&rsquo;s constituency is the Tennessee Plantation House, which is also  being half funded: the total project costs &pound;300,000 and it is being funded to  the tune of &pound;150,000. Both applications have been approved in principle for financial  support, subject to economic appraisal.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, although I understand why the Member is asking  me the question in relation to West Tyrone, I want to assure him that we have  not forgotten about other areas throughout Northern Ireland &mdash; perish the  thought &mdash; and we will continue to support those other areas. I hope that he  understands that those two projects are being supported.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>:  Will the Minister outline what she proposes to do with regard to the production  of a new tourism strategy for Northern    Ireland?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment</strong>: As I indicated, the new strategy is being developed. The  steering group that I set up has been meeting tourism leaders and business and  public sector representatives. I very much hope to have that tourism strategy  in the near future. It will give me a clear and inspiring vision for an action  plan for the development of Northern    Ireland as a tourism destination.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">When I was in India  last week, I took the opportunity to promote Northern   Ireland as a place for people from India to visit.  It gave me great pleasure to do that, because I believe that we have a tourism  product that is increasing in value, and we need to continue to promote it as  much as we can.</p>

      <p class="Q3Motion">Report on the PFI Contract for Northern Ireland&rsquo;s New Vehicle  Testing Facilities (NIA 168/08-09) &mdash; <span class="Italic">[The Chairperson,  Public Accounts Committee (Mr P Maskey).]</span></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>:  For my sins, I have been asked to speak about private finance initiatives  (PFI). The Public Accounts Committee has looked at a number of PFIs in the past  year. One of the first PFI contracts that the Committee looked at was the  upgrade of MOT centres to the tune of &pound;57 million. The contract was to provide  installation and maintenance of new MOT testing equipment. For whatever reason,  this was state-of-the-art equipment, and it has been in operation since 2003.  However, given the time that the equipment has been in operation, the full test  is not being carried out in line with EU requirements, and the targets for test  times included in the PFI contract are not being achieved.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It was interesting to note in that investigation that the  Driver and Vehicle Agency (DVA) has not claimed or received compensation from  the private contractor. One thing that the Committee outlined and underlined in  the course of its work was that any future contracts need to be clearly and  properly structured and have built-in enforceable penalty clauses to cover  circumstances in which the private sector does not deliver on the targets set  out in the PFI contract. In the case of the MOT centres, it looks as though the  private contractor found a get-out clause and managed to walk away.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">However, the Committee welcomed the fact that DVA&rsquo;s  performance against the 18-minute test time in the MOT contract has improved  drastically in recent times. Anybody who has had to MOT their car in the past  year will fully recognise that the waiting lists are well down. However, that  improvement has come with a huge price tag to the public sector. It took &pound;6  million in extra staffing costs to bring about that reduction in waiting lists.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The DVA is considering that it is no longer realistic to  conduct an MOT in 18 minutes, and it is looking at a 27-minute period as a more  accurate time for each test. All those issues will have a knock-on effect with  regard to throughput in all centres.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">For example, if MOT centres were to take 27 minutes rather  than 18 minutes to complete a test, it would not be possible to inspect the  same number of vehicles, and there would be huge cost implications. Huge  additional resources would be required, and those resources would no doubt be  sought from the public purse.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee considered the Driver and Vehicle Agency to  have done too little to resolve its difficulties, and it urged it to complete  quickly a full performance review of the entire contract. On my speaking notes,  I have underlined the phrase &ldquo;complete quickly&rdquo; because that recommendation was  made in the then Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report three years earlier,  and yet that review has never been carried out. That is very telling.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There is wide recognition that, when it comes to MOTs, the  standard In Northern Ireland is probably a great deal higher than it is  anywhere else. I am very tempted to say that it is higher than anywhere else in  Europe &mdash; anywhere else in the world, come to that &mdash; yet whether we need it to  be of such a high standard is another matter. However, the Committee did  receive reasonably positive feedback that the situation had improved under the  PFI contract.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Another PFI contract that the Committee examined was the  contract to build the laboratory and pharmacy services centre at Altnagelvin, a  key component of the &pound;250 million redevelopment of the Altnagelvin Area   Hospital complex. The  project involved the construction of a highly complex newbuild at the site,  but, despite its complexity and cost, the Committee was still genuinely  surprised to learn that the whole project would not be completed until 2015-16  &mdash; more than 20 years after the redevelopment programme was launched. The centre  took over six years to be developed and there were inbuilt delays, which caused  an increase in the initial cost of approximately &pound;4 million. Those costs were  reflected in an increase in the unitary charges over the 25 years of the  contract.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">However, all the Committee members were genuinely impressed  that, despite the complexity of the project and the inbuilt delays of the  process, the costs were kept under control. That was the result of the use of  exemplar design in the management of the project, and it was quite clear from  the Committee&rsquo;s investigation that the use of that process had enabled the  contractors to keep the costs under control, and one of its recommendations was  that future PFI projects should make use of that process. The project at  Altnagelvin did not meet its projected timescale, but its costs were kept under  control, and those costs ultimately would have had to have been met from the  public purse.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I  also pay tribute to the staff of the Public Accounts Committee, and to the  staff of the Northern Ireland Audit Office, without whose assistance we would  not be able to function appropriately. Given the recent retirement of  Comptroller and Auditor General John Dowdall, who had served for many years, it  is also appropriate that Committee members should record our appreciation for  his advice and guidance.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Accountability is the key to good management and to the  deliverance of good performance. The Northern Ireland Audit Office, and the  subsequent scrutiny of its reports by the Public Accounts Committee, holds  permanent secretaries and other senior civil servants to account for  expenditure. The Committee&rsquo;s recommend&shy;ations endeavour to prevent the  repetition of bad practice so that better use is made of public funds.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">During the 2007-08 and 2008-09 sessions, the Committee  examined a wide range of reports. Although it normally highlights the need for  improvements to be made, the Committee also highlighted some of the good  practices that it has come across.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The PFI laboratory and pharmacy centre project at  Altnagelvin was mentioned earlier. During the Committee&rsquo;s investigation it  found that, although not subject to a full gateway review, it was subject to a  health check to ensure a final appropriate contract specification. It also made  use of exemplar design. The views of stakeholders were incorporated so that the  final design met the needs of those who would use the service.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee covered a wide range of Departments in its  investigation. I have chosen to concentrate on some specific reports where  Departments must do more work.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">From the perspective of a local councillor &mdash; and I declare  an interest as a local councillor &mdash; I encountered some of the difficulties that  arose from the miscalculation of the penny product. Indeed, I, along with other  councillors, experienced huge variations in the amounts of money that we could  expect to raise during the estimation of our rates calculations for the  subsequent years. At one stage, we were told that additional moneys would have  to be raised locally, and we were then told that extra money would be coming to  us. We found it very difficult to have a stable base from which to plan and  work the rates process. Indeed, several councils wrote to the Committee to draw  attention to that issue. The Committee addressed those issues in the course of  its inquiry, which it followed up recently. Councils have had difficulty in  setting an accurate rate, given such variations in the penny product.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Public Accounts Committee also exposed the scale of the  failure of Land and Property Services to inspect vacant property. Surely, that  is one of the most basic functions of a rates collection agency. Fortunately,  local council staff worked subsequently with Land and Property Services to  assist in invoicing an additional &pound;21 million. That money will be available to  the Northern Ireland Executive and councils to pay for public services, and it  will help to keep down the cost for ratepayers who have been paying their  rates. It is important that that aspect of the work is carried out.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">During the evidence session, I related to civil servants  the difficulty that I had in requesting a rates bill. I had to chase Land and  Property Services repeatedly for a bill to pay. That is a very strange  phenomenon for an organisation whose job it is to collect money. I assure  Members that no business would have such difficulty. That, and other issues  exposed by the Public Accounts Committee, contributed to the decision to have  the performance and efficiency delivery unit (PEDU) examine Land and Property  Services&rsquo;s operations and the subsequent action plan.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I had a brief look at the action plan, which lists some  basic issues: the need for integration between the valuation and revenue  functions; the need to focus on its business priorities; a clear sense of  purpose for the organisation; strengthening the understanding of and focus on  the agency&rsquo;s key customers; and maximising revenue collection against accurate  and timely assessments. Those points are not rocket science. However, the need  to have them listed illustrates that Land and Property Services must have lost  its way if those basics were not central to what it was doing. I welcome the  fact that those issues have been highlighted as key points.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is hoped that additional moneys will be raised and  available for public use. A more timely intervention should reduce rates  arrears and bad debt. Regrettably, however, poor past performance will,  undoubtedly, result in increased levels of bad debt being declared and less  money being available for public use. I hope that there will be significant  improvements in that area.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I turn now to the report on managing sickness absences in  the Civil Service. It is estimated that the private sector has an average of  six days&rsquo; absence for each employee each year; the Civil Service in Great  Britain has an average of 9&middot;3 days&rsquo; absence for each employee; the Northern  Ireland Civil Service had an average of 13&middot;7 days&rsquo; absence for each employee  for 2006-07. Although there are increasing strains on public finance, it is  even more critical today to get more value for the money that we spend. Paying  for absentee staff is not good value.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The vast majority of civil servants have a good attendance  record and others have certified illnesses, but some are abusing sickness  entitlement and putting additional pressure on their colleagues.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee&rsquo;s second recommendation was that the  Department should keep a firm spotlight on that and that the reports should be  significantly disaggregated to identify absentee hot spots in Departments and  agencies. I hope that that will occur. It is important that all managers  recognise their accountability and manage the absenteeism of their staff.  Equally, there is a role for Committees in that area. During the evidence  session we also advised that &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member should bring his remarks to a close.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  There is no reason why there should be lower levels of attendance in the Civil  Service than in the private sector.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It has been a busy year for the Committee, which has  covered a wide range of subjects, and regrettably we have had to return to some  subjects, but &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>: I  wish to focus on the PAC report on financial management in the colleges of  further education prior to the reorganisation into six regional colleges in  2007. I will try to explain why I believe that that was a very important  report. It outlines a classic example of hands-off bodies stashing money that  they do not need and which could be spent on providing educational services  that are in great demand and under pressure.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">A total of &pound;44 million was in the vaults of six colleges,  doing nothing for the people for whom it was intended. It fails me to understand  why those colleges could not find a use for that money to improve the  educational prospects of people who look to the colleges of further education  for a second chance to learn skills that would improve their prospects of  getting a job, or, indeed, developing their skills to get a better-paid and  more secure job. If those colleges were so well heeled, they could have handed  the money back so that it could be used to fund front line services, such as  the Health Service, which was starved of money.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The report found that senior management teams in the  pre-regional colleges were not equipped with the skills and experience  necessary for financial governance responsibilities. That was a damning  indictment of the Department, which should have ensured that recipients of  public money had the basic skills in how to manage it. If there is any good  news from the report, it is an undertaking from the Department &mdash; given only  last week &mdash; that in future, no more than 10% cash balances will be retained.  The Public Accounts Committee welcomes that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In trying to understand how so much money could lie idle in  bank accounts, the PAC discovered that the Department was negligent in several  ways. Monitoring reports were frequently submitted late with no penalty, and no  action was taken when the reports flagged up serious financial practices. The  Department, I am glad to say, has given an assurance that improved governance  arrangements have been put in place for the six new colleges; however, I have  to question that because problems have arisen in the new Belfast Metropolitan  College, and the Department has not been able to explain why.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Speaking personally, it is a great source of frustration that,  after the PAC devoted a great deal of time and energy to scrutinising reports  produced by the Comptroller and Auditor General, we find that our  recommendations are frequently ignored. That suggests that greater penalties  are needed to ensure that the PAC is fully effective in the job that it does &mdash;  and does with great commitment.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It would be remiss of me not to spell out how serious the  incompetence of the colleges of further education has been and how their lack  of financial management skills has affected the people who should benefit from the  services that they are supposed to deliver. One quarter of the total population  between the ages of 16 and 64 lack basic skills &mdash; skills that may just make  them employable at a time when unemployment has doubled in the past 12 months.  Those who are in employment could have upgraded their skills and gone on to  obtain more highly skilled jobs that would be less at risk in the present  economic downturn.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I have often said in the Chamber that education is the  greatest weapon for resolving inequality and offering political stability. I  declare an interest in that I owe my further education to the technical college  in Coleraine, and I have nothing but admiration for the people who have  delivered vocational education there to many students for more than 70 years.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The case of Fermanagh College of Further and Higher  Education, which was covered by the Committee&rsquo;s report, was particularly  worrying. Fundamental breaches of public accountability and basic financial  mismanage&shy;ment resulted in the college having to repay more than &pound;1 million of  improperly claimed funding. That money had been claimed before class numbers  had been finalised. Clearly, there was no clear leadership or sense of  strategic direction at the college.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is gratifying that the Department for Employment and  Learning has responded to the Committee&rsquo;s concerns with a review of governance  arrangements. The Department has also undertaken to effectively communicate  lessons to all the colleges through a programme of health checks, which are to  commence before March 2010, with a workshop for all college senior managers to  take place this autumn. Further training programmes are to take place in the  future.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to put on record my personal thanks to the former  Comptroller and Auditor General Mr John Dowdall for his outstanding  contribution to tackling financial irregularities, poor service and, indeed,  fraud in public bodies. He was extremely concerned about the rights of the  people whom I mentioned at the beginning of my speech, the 25% of people who  lack basic skills and who could have their lives transformed if colleges of  further education were to make best use of the resources that they are given.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Stashing the money in the vaults was a serious injustice.  Let us hope that the publication of the report will mean that never again will  that kind of embarrassment hang over the Assembly. In future, let us hope that  FE colleges will be known for their students&rsquo; successes and that the great  history that they have had will be restored. That can happen only if the people  who work in those institutions have the financial support and expertise in the  future that they clearly did not have during the time that I have just spoken  about.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>: I  have been asked to talk about the general subject of fraud in the public  sector, rather than about a specific report.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Fraud is a serious problem, and it is estimated that it  costs the public sector in Northern    Ireland around &pound;500 million every year.  Given today&rsquo;s economic climate, in which we are in the teeth of a recession,  the public sector must be even more vigilant in guarding against fraudulent  activity.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The clich&eacute; that fraud is not a victimless crime is worth  repeating because every pound that is stolen by a fraudster is one pound less  for the improvement of public services. I notice that the Minister of Finance  and Personnel is in the Chamber; if he were able to get his hands on some of  that &pound;500 million, he would be more than pleased. It might make a difference to  the figure of &pound;370 million that is being bandied about in the other direction.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Comptroller and Auditor General has been given powers  to deal with the problem. Under statutory provisions that were inserted in the  Audit and Account&shy;ability (Northern    Ireland) Order 2003 by the Serious Crime Act  2007, the Comptroller and Auditor General has the power to conduct  data-matching exercises for the purposes of assisting in the prevention and  detection of fraud.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">That legislation provides a significant opportunity to  tackle and reduce the scale of fraud in Northern Ireland and beyond, and it  should provide a strong deterrent against future fraudulent acts. Data matching  is a powerful tool in combating fraud, as is demonstrated by the national fraud  initiative, which was established by the Audit Commission in 1996. The Audit  Commission has so far helped participating bodies to identify around &pound;400  million of fraud and overpayments.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In consultation with the Information Commissioner and other  stakeholders, the Audit Office has prepared a code of practice for data  matching. On 25 July 2008, that code was laid before the Assembly. It promotes  good practice and data matching. It helps to ensure compliance with the law,  especially the provisions of the Data Protection Act 1998.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The first exercise was undertaken by the Comptroller and  Auditor General as part of the national fraud initiative exercise for 2008-09.  The Audit Commission, on behalf of the Comptroller and Auditor General, carried  out key aspects of the exercise, including the collection and processing of  data.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">A total of 70 public sector bodies provided data for the first  round of the exercise. They included Departments and their executive agencies;  larger non-departmental public bodies; Health Service bodies; and district  councils. A small number of other bodies provided data voluntarily.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The types of data sets included information on payroll;  pensions; trade creditors; housing benefits; housing tenants; blue badge  holders; rates; and the electoral register. Those data sets were gathered in  October 2008. The matching exercise took place shortly after that. In February 2009,  bodies started to receive their results, which they are now in the process of  examining. It is hoped that by the end of 2009, the process will be substantially  completed. The Audit Office then proposes to compile a report on the national  fraud initiative. We look forward to that report.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Chairman outlined the Brangam Bagnall and Co inquiry in  some detail; therefore, I will not. That inquiry has given me a perspective on  public sector fraud, which, certainly, informs my work as a PAC member. In 2007,  we looked at a relatively minor case of fraud that involved the Ordnance Survey  of Northern Ireland. In 2008, we produced our report on social security benefit  fraud and error. In 2009, we have dealt with the inquiry into suspected fraud  in the education and library boards.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee has also dealt with certain aspects of a  report on Valence Technology, which is due to be published soon. We could not  get to the bottom of certain matters. As a result, the Committee has repeated recommendations  on counter-fraud policies and the importance of basic checks and supervisory  arrangements. Those simple steps can identify and prevent fraud at an early  stage.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As is evidenced in the report on Brangam Bagnall and Co,  and in other cases to which I have referred, fraud is often simple. It relies  on the incompetence of supervisory staff; on basic checks and procedures being  lax; and, in the case of Brangam Bagnall and Co, on friendship and trust  replacing a businesslike approach and general vigilance. The late Mr Brangam  exploited the old boys&rsquo; network shamelessly. No one came out of that case with  any credit; not even the Department of Health, Social Services and Public  Safety or the Law Society, which were supposed to supervise his activities.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The data-matching exercise reinforces the Committee&rsquo;s  recommendations in its inquiries. Departments must allow information sharing in  order to prevent fraudsters from repeating offences. An environment of open  communication is encouraged. It contributes to early detection of non-compliance  with controls and can help to identify problems early.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is also a key part of the culture that is required for a  robust, whistle-blowing policy to be maintained and fully implemented. During  the course of its work on various reports, the Committee has found that, often,  whistle-blowers&rsquo; allegations, which should be properly investigated, are not.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Many times, as a constituency politician, I have heard misgivings  that have been voiced by members of the public, which, when investigated, have  led to significant findings of malpractice and conflict of interest, in  particular. Therefore, I fully endorse all efforts by Departments to promote a  whistle-blowing culture. I commend the national fraud initiative as an example  of good practice and robust efficiency. The role of the Public Accounts  Committee, as the guardian of taxpayers&rsquo; money, is to ensure that no fraud is  deemed acceptable.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Earlier, I mentioned Valence Technologies. The report on  that case is due to be published on 1 October 2009. Therefore, I cannot discuss  it. Let me just say that some reports have been known to highlight matters  other than fraud; perhaps, the need to maintain good practice, even under  pressure, and to learn lessons from previous experiences and, indeed, previous  PAC reports, such as that which was produced on the DeLorean inquiry.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Will the Member bring his remarks to a close?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>: I  will finish there, Mr Speaker.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">4.00 pm</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>:  The other day, someone asked me to describe the role of a Back-Bencher in controlling  the Executive, and I said that trying to control the Executive is like standing  jeering at a passing steamroller. To a large extent, that is how one feels  about one&rsquo;s role as an obscure Back-Bencher in this House.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">However, the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) is the one  Committee that really seems to have teeth. That is because Departments fear the  arrival of the Comptroller and Auditor General in their offices, and they fear  the PAC&rsquo;s reports.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I spent a very happy 15 or 16 months on the Public Accounts  Committee; it was interesting to watch it in action. I pay tribute to the  staff, particularly the outgoing Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr John  Dowdall, who is a remarkable individual. At his farewell meeting with the  Committee, I said to him that he has the intellect of an accountant and the  voice of an archbishop. He has that resounding air of authority that makes  people respect him. I knew that his staff were in very good hands. He has since  retired, and on behalf of the people of the Province, I pay tribute to his  controlling investigations into the misuse of expenditure. My colleague Mr  Craig also congratulates Mr Dowdall on his hard work. I wish Mr Dowdall all the  best for a long and happy retirement.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">When I was on the Committee, I saw two extremes in its  reports. During the Committee&rsquo;s investigation of the pathology laboratory at Altnagelvin Area  Hospital in Londonderry,  I kept asking myself what we were doing and why we were there, because the only  scandal that I saw was that there was not a pathology laboratory such as that  in Altnagelvin in either Newry or Downpatrick. It is an outstanding facility  with wonderful staff who do tremendous work. The only crimes that the trust was  perhaps guilty of were excelling in patient care and trying to do too much for  patients. The laboratory might have run over budget, but the motivation behind  that was getting a gold-plated facility for the people of the north-west. I  congratulate the trust for that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I know that the Committee felt obliged to look at that  issue. However, I felt that the trust came out of that process with shining  colours. I ask that there be similar facilities in Daisy  Hill Hospital  and Downe Hospital so that the Committee can  investigate those as well. My constituents would love to have such wonderful  facilities.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">That is one extreme of the type of work that the Committee  does. I suppose that we must look at the good guys as well as the bad guys to  give a sense of balance. The Committee also looked at the issue of absenteeism.  I worked for the National Trust for 10 years during the late 1980s and early  1990s. That was a wonderful time; however, not everyone understood my role. I  once asked someone to join the National Trust, and he said that his money was  with Bradford and Bingley already. Therefore, not everyone understood the role  of the National Trust in Northern    Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">During my time with the National Trust, I noticed a fact  about absenteeism that came out in the Committee&rsquo;s &lsquo;Report on Managing Sickness  Absence in the Northern Ireland Civil Service&rsquo;. I had hourly paid staff who did  not get paid if they did not turn up and monthly paid staff who got paid no  matter what happened. It was, therefore, no surprise that absenteeism was 14  times higher among the monthly paid staff than it was among the hourly paid  staff. Both were doing identical work and hours, but if the hourly paid staff  did not turn in, they did not get paid. Will someone explain to me why monthly  paid staff can catch a range of plagues, diseases and illnesses when hourly paid  staff are as fit as Olympic runners? There must be some reason for that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Will someone also explain to me why pestilence swept  through my office on Friday afternoons and Monday mornings but did not seem to  affect the office on Tuesdays and Wednesdays? I never understood that. That  report found that discrepancy: in certain workplaces staff got very ill, while  in others, staff were very healthy.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I do not know what was going on in DRD or DARD, but staff  in both those Departments seemed to be very happy; everyone came in, and nobody  got ill. However, Members cannot say that that was because of the Ministers &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Laughter.] </span>The Committee&rsquo;s report dealt with the  pre-devolution situation, so those Ministers, who remain utterly unmentionable,  cannot claim that staff were happy because they worked for them.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Why is it that in DARD the absenteeism rate was  considerably lower than in DSD, DOE, or other Departments? It may be that the  DARD staff were happier in their work, or there may be other reasons. However,  there can be no excuse for the fact that absenteeism in some Departments within  the Northern Ireland Civil Service is almost double that in certain parts of  private industry.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Quite simply, there are some civil servants who,  unfortunately, consider that there are a number of days a year that they can  take off as what are known as &ldquo;sickies&rdquo;. For example, they feel that it is  allowable to take a few days off to go Christmas shopping. That is simply not  allowable. It is not allowable for MLAs, it is not allowable for our staff,  and, therefore, it should not be allowable for civil servants.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We may all laugh about that and it may seem very amusing.  However, when you add up the total cost to the Exchequer of absenteeism in Northern Ireland,  it equates to several new hospitals or several thousand new nurses. It is  important that we get to grips with absenteeism, and, therefore, I think that  it was important that the PAC did a report and exposed the difficulties that we  face. We must drive down absenteeism to the average of private enterprise. That  simply has to be the case. We cannot tolerate the laissez-faire, easy-going  attitude that there is.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">That said, being a member of the PAC was an enjoyable  experience. It is hard to judge, but I think that I have moved on to perhaps slightly  higher things. However, I know that the Committee is in good hands, and I  welcome the fact that a letter from the PAC calling witnesses to give evidence  is still seen as a fearful, torturous process that no permanent secretary wants  to experience. The PAC must keep up the good work, keep causing fear within the  Departments, and, hopefully, someday, we will do ourselves out of a job. I  doubt that that is going to happen in my lifetime. However, Mr Dowdall can  enjoy reading and playing golf, safe in the understanding that he has done a  very good job for the people of Northern    Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  I was not anticipating being called to speak in this debate, but no matter. I  am relatively new to the Public Accounts Committee, although it was visited  upon me once upon a time before. The notes from which I am reading say  &ldquo;arcane&rdquo;, but, sometimes, I am not sure whether the PAC is arcane or archaic.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Nevertheless, since becoming a member of the Public Accounts  Committee, I have attended one briefing and one evidence session. Issues have  cropped up in my capacity as an MLA, and I have referred those to the  Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s office. I have to say that when I was  previously at the PAC, Mr Dowdall always came across as extremely competent,  very approachable, knowledgeable in his brief, and knowledge&shy;able in the method  by which one should approach that brief with the backup of his staff.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">During the period to which the motion relates, the Committee  undertook a report on the financial governance arrangements of North/South  bodies. In researching that report, the PAC conferred with the Committee of Public  Accounts in the Oireachtas in Dublin.  This working year, the two Committees will meet again to cross-reference their  findings on North/South bodies and, perhaps, even go so far as to synchronise  the launch of their respective reports on those matters. In common with other  Members, we look forward with bated breath to that approach.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">This year, the Committee produced two composite reports,  its second and third, and the subjects dealt with are too many and varied for  me to deal with today. For me to even recall them at such short notice would be  quite a task. However, I note that that mechanism enabled the Committee to make  important contributions to the development of the reinvestment and reform  initiative. It is hoped that that will be of particular interest in this time  of economic concern.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I note from previous reports that an issue which has been  brought to my attention &mdash; the involvement of private consultancy firms, and  their cost to the public exchequer &mdash; has come before the Comptroller and  Auditor General and the Public Accounts Committee. Inevitably, given the more  recent revelations, that will come back under the scrutiny of the Committee.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I have looked into the reports that Members will be most  aware of; namely, those dealt with by evidence session. In particular, I will  discuss the recommendations that the Committee made in its progress report on  shared services, which is part of the Civil Service reform agenda to make  public services more efficient. Turning to the shared services report, I will  give a brief overview of the projects, and comment on the lessons that the  Committee drew from its evidence sessions.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The report on shared services was a snapshot of the reform  project and incorporated seven initiatives, including Workplace 2010, Account  NI, HR Connect and Network NI. The Committee was aware that the reform  programme represented a major commitment of resource; it was estimated to have  a total value of &pound;3 billion.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As all the reform projects were central to the future  organisation and delivery of public services, it was the Committee&rsquo;s view that  projects should be subject to the Gateway Review process at the prescribed  stages of their procurement, implementation or service operation. The Committee  recommended the approval of DFP Supply before committing resources, which was  also a key safeguard in providing assurance to the Assembly that decisions had  been subject to independent scrutiny.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee also found that the projects presented an  enormous management challenge for the Department and that, although it had  taken steps to build capacity and skills among staff through its new Centre for  Applied Learning, 2006 research showed that the Northern Ireland Civil Service  was ill-equipped to deliver such a varied range of projects. Apparently, the  Committee was aghast that one individual was given a key role and  responsibility for delivering four of the major shared-services projects.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Overall, it appears that the Department took on a  challenging workload and ambitiously initiated the reform agenda only to find  that the timetabling for the projects and the resource requirement allocated to  them were unrealistic. The Committee was also concerned at delays in  implementation and at the suspension of the Workplace 2010 project at the time.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, the procurement of the Workplace 2010 project,  which was subsequently terminated, indentified a key lesson that has wider  applicability across the public sector. The procurement process was the subject  of a legal challenge by an unsuccessful bidder. Although DFP was convinced that  it could win the case, after advice from counsel, it settled the case at a cost  to the taxpayer of &pound;225,000. However, the full cost to the Department was &pound;1&middot;2  million.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In the Committee&rsquo;s view, concluding a settlement in cases  where Departments are convinced that they will resist legal challenge sends the  completely wrong signal to other unsuccessful bidders about the Government&rsquo;s  determination to stand over their tender processes where there is a robust case  to do so.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">This was a very useful case study by the Committee. By the  time of next year&rsquo;s debate, it says in my speech that I will be a &ldquo;fully  fledged veteran&rdquo; of the Committee.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Wilson</strong>:  The Member will be ancient. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  I am already encouraged by the role that I see the Committee fulfilling in  impartially scrutinising Government expenditure and rolling out recommendations  for improved financial governance across the public sector.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">From one veteran to another, Mr Speaker, thank you.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I am not sure whether I am a veteran, but I have been a member of the Public  Accounts Committee for almost a year.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Public Accounts Committee has had a varied and busy year  of business. I will focus on two reports; one on bovine TB and the other on the  sea fisheries scheme for the modernisation and tie-up of vessels. Both of those  issues have significant public-expenditure impacts; they impact aggressively on  farming and fishing communities in Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I will initially make my remarks as a member of the PAC. However, I will also speak in my capacity as an  elected representative, because, coming from a farming and fishing  constituency, I can bring my knowledge of that to the debate.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">A quarter ir mair o&rsquo; aa the herds o&rsquo; kine I Norlin Airlan  hae bovine TB an&rsquo; the Committee richtly allooed at thon hannlin shud bae leuked  intae. Thair wus a bag ris&rsquo; i caases this las&rsquo; wheen o&rsquo; years peakin&rsquo; i 1997 aa  13% at bes the heighest level i Europe. I the las&rsquo; 10 yeirs the Depairtment hes  spent sum 10 million pun oan hit&rsquo;s programme tae dae awa&rsquo; wi&rsquo; bovine TB. The airt  wurst hit bae bovine TB bes Strangford an&rsquo; mid-Down</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">At least a quarter of all cattle herds in Northern Ireland  have had bovine TB, and the Committee correctly concluded that that grave  problem merited investigation. Just today, at a meeting of the Agriculture  Committee, that matter was raised with departmental officials. There has been a  significant increase in cases of bovine TB in recent years; in 1997, it peaked  at 13%, which was the highest level in Europe.  Over the past 10 years, the Department has spent some &pound;200 million on its  bovine TB control programme. The area with the highest incidence in the whole  of Northern Ireland  is Strangford and mid-Down.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Despite the Department&rsquo;s investment in controlling the  disease, bovine TB can cause considerable economic losses through livestock  deaths, chronic disease and trade restrictions.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is certainly in the taxpayers&rsquo; interest to eradicate it,  and it has been eradicated in many countries. The Committee was, therefore,  staggered to hear the Department concede that its current bovine TB strategy  will not lead to eradication. That the Department should spend so much to achieve  mere containment is unacceptable.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">4.15 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am not sure whether anyone from the Department is in the  Public Gallery. I encouraged them this morning to come along to the debate, but  perhaps the thought of being lambasted by the Public Accounts Committee has  made them stay away. However, if they are here somewhere, I congratulate them.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department formally reviewed its bovine TB eradication  policy between 1999 and 2002. However, we are still no further along. Progress  has been slow, and not all the recommendations of that review have been implemented.  Similarly, in a review of testing arrange&shy;ments, a range of improvements were  recommended by consultants in 2006, and those have still not been acted upon.  The officials told us that they will have a wee talk about it for five years.  However, the Public Accounts Committee wants action. Such delays are  indefensible.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee was also surprised that the Department was  not fully compliant with the EU directive on combating bovine TB, and had not,  therefore, availed itself of EU funding that is aimed at eradicating the disease.  Again, there seems to be a delay in the Depart&shy;ment. At long last, the  Department has accepted the Committee&rsquo;s recommendation to bring itself into  line with the directive, which is a welcome step. However, we will wait to see  whether the words are turned into actions.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee further recommended that the Department  introduces the pre-movement testing of animals to address the risk of  purchasing infected animals; that it reaches an objective, evidence-based  conclusion and strategy on the impact of wildlife, particularly badgers, on  bovine TB; and that herd owners on infected farms are given biosecurity  training. Let us see action following the words.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We cannot be complacent about the continuing grip of bovine  TB, nor about expenditure of, on average, &pound;20 million a year to contain it. The  Department of Agriculture and Rural Development must move urgently, focus on  concrete measures, and use good practice from successful eradication policies  to end bovine TB in Northern    Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I have often asked questions about the undoubted link  between badgers and bovine TB, yet the Department refuses to take the views of  farmers and vets seriously. I advocate the eradication of badgers, and I ask  the Department to do likewise. I know that the green Member to my right &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I will gladly give way to the Member. I am sure that he will have words of  wisdom.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>: I  cannot allow those scurrilous accusations against the badger community to go  unanswered. The jury is still out on a link between badgers and bovine TB. Some  scientists believe that there is a direct link, and others believe that they  have proved that there is no link. There is also a view that attempted  eradication simply causes badger communities to disperse, thereby spreading  disease among cattle. Although the Member is entitled to his opinion, I ask  that he does not quote it as fact. It is heresy.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  Stop badgering him. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  It is not heresy; it is fact. The Member has his opinion, and I have mine. I  can back my opinion up with scientists&rsquo; views. The Member will, of course, have  his environmental, green-tinted view, which we also have to accept.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Sea fisheries grant schemes have amounted to &pound;18 million  since 1993 to fund three vessel decommissioning schemes and three vessel  modernisation schemes. I have often stood up in the Chamber to represent the  fishermen of my constituency, and I have helped them to make a living despite  EU restrictions and regulations. I know that my colleague who just spoke has  done likewise. Europe is so concerned with the  so-called scientific reports that say that there are no fish reserves that it  will curb fishing completely, which will undoubtedly kill off any chance of  fishermen in the Province being able to make a living.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The EU wants to cut fleet sizes and the time that fishermen  spend at sea. I was late arriving in the Chamber because I was at a meeting  with fishermen of white fish at which that very issue was raised. Many issues  need to be taken on board. The Public Accounts Committee examined the issue of  help and grant aid to fishing boats. I was hopeful that the outcome would be one  of support for fishermen, because there is something wrong when fishermen can  see schools and schools of fish but are not allowed to touch them.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee also found that, despite spending &pound;3 million  on modernisation schemes, the Department had failed to survey the fleet and  identify and prioritise specific modernisation needs. Nor did it observe good  practice in allocating only the minimum amount needed for the project to  proceed. The Committee has now received undertakings that the Department will  address both those points. Again, the Public Accounts Committee has made sure  that that will happen.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee addressed other issues &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I ask the Member to bring his remarks to a close.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  Do I not get a wee bit of extra time because of the intervention?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  No.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  Oh, for goodness&rsquo; sake.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I accept that. Speaking with my constituency hat on, the  Department must step up and handle the issue with greater skill and interest. I  hope that the Minister will make that pledge today. As a new member of the  Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development, I assure the House that I will  remind officials of their obligations on bovine TB and on decommissioning.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member&rsquo;s time is definitely up.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel (Mr S Wilson)</strong>: This is my first Public Accounts  Committee debate, and I am pleased to respond to the valuable, varied,  interesting and amusing comments of Committee members and others who have been  thrown off the Committee and have, as Mr Wells said, been elevated to higher  things.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I have listened intently to Members&rsquo; contributions. I will  make a few general remarks, after which I will try to deal with as many as  possible of the issues that Members raised. I acknowledge the work of the  Committee, which has held 12 evidence sessions and made a significant number of  valuable recommendations to strengthen financial management and corporate  governance across the public sector. Furthermore, I acknowledge the role of the  Chairman, Mr Maskey, and the Deputy Chairman, Mr Beggs, who have created a Committee  that, as Mr Wells said, engenders fear and trembling in the public servants who  are called before it.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to add my comments about John Dowdall, who recently  retired as Comptroller and Auditor General. I echo other Members&rsquo; comments; we  owe him a deep gratitude for his work as an accountant who preyed on  Departments or as an archbishop who prayed for Departments. I am not too sure  which of the two roles he played. I congratulate his successor, Kieran Donnelly,  on his appointment to the post of Comptroller and Auditor General. That role is  challenging in the current economic climate, when public services are under  pressure and when all public servants need to deliver more with limited  resources.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to outline what I believe should be the role of the  PAC and the Audit Office reports. I do not need to remind Members of the  financial pressures on us, and Ministers have already taken several measures to  alleviate the problems created by the local economic downturn. That downturn  has reduced capital receipts through its impact on the property market. The  Executive need to address that issue. The Executive must also address the issue  of providing support to local households and business through, for example, the  deferral of domestic water charges and the new policy on the prompt payment of  invoices, which helps small business and gets money out much more quickly. On  top of that, we have had to address other pressures such as the cost of swine  flu and the efficiency savings from Her Majesty&rsquo;s Treasury. The list goes on.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In light of those pressures, it is important that public  servants work more smartly, more efficiently and more effectively to deliver  the best possible services. In doing so, we must not sacrifice proper  accountability for public expenditure and transparency for our actions. That is  what the debate has been about. However, I want to emphasise that we must be  careful not to criticise people for taking reasonable risks and initiatives to  deliver on public services. We need to open new ways of working, and staff need  freedom to innovate. I know that the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment answered  questions on the independent review of economic policy earlier today.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">One of the points made in that review was that Invest  Northern Ireland should be allowed more freedom to be innovative. That freedom  means not having to go through box-ticking exercises. I want to say something  about that, because I fear that, sometimes, we do not get the balance right.  There is much that we have to do to find new and better ways of doing things.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">&lsquo;Managing Public Money&rsquo;, which is the Treasury&rsquo;s guide to  the use of resources in the public sector, makes an important point. It states:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;It is also important to be aware that excessive  caution can be as damaging as unnecessary risk taking.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That appears to me to strike the right note.  Although I believe that the Audit Office and the Public Accounts Committee have  important roles to play in achieving that balance and in helping public sector  organisations to get value for money from the resources that they use, it is  right and proper that those who have the responsibility of spending taxpayers&rsquo;  money are held accountable to the Northern Ireland Assembly for the use of the  resources that are under their control.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Scrutiny of public spending is in all our interests; not  only does it instil confidence in our system, but it allows us to promote good  practice in the management of public funds and to expose examples of poor use  of resources, and, even worse, as Mr Lunn pointed out, instances of fraud,  which can take place in any organisation.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Over the past two or three years, there has been considerable  focus on compliance and governance issues. A number of Audit Office reports  have dealt with those issues and have led to a significant strengthening of  governance in the period. Despite that, however, has the process become more  important than the product? I worry that finance directors in Departments and  public bodies are spending more time giving the Audit Office what it wants, as  regards box-ticking exercises, than concentrating on the better use and best  use of resources. We have all had experience of that in our constituency roles.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>: I  hope that the Minister agrees that it is important to put on record that  neither the Audit Office nor the Public Accounts Committee have ever criticised  or condemned any Department that had in its criteria the risks that he referred  to and that managed those risks properly. The only Departments that have been  criticised are those that did not do so.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: Perhaps the Member has missed the point. The  importance that the Audit Office has sometimes placed on process has led to the  introduction of caution in decision-making, which is not always the best way of  using resources effectively.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am going to develop that point. When the Assembly  examines the use of public resources, we use the three &ldquo;Es&rdquo; &mdash; efficiency,  effectiveness and economy. Those should form the central premise that we employ  when we consider how resources are used. The process is, of course, important,  and the proper procedures must be adhered to. However, I sometimes fear that  reports which, by their very nature, concentrate on process and governance  either put less emphasis on, or ignore, the principles of efficiency,  effectiveness and economy. Perhaps we should ask whether all the scrutiny by  the Audit Office and the Public Accounts Committee, and, indeed, my Department,  improves performance and ensures that public money is well spent.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I will throw out a challenge to the PAC.  Since devolution, that Committee has been very active and has produced a large  number of reports. However, does the Committee recognise that it has made over  450 recommendations? I am happy to take interventions from its members about  this matter.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">4.30 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Has the Committee thought about the systems and bureaucracy  that have sprung up to monitor recommend&shy;ations and to ensure that they have  been followed up? Sometimes, the Assembly takes decisions for the best of  reasons, but implementation requires the use of departmental resources, whether  through manpower, time or capital. We must bear that in mind.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In preparing for the debate, another issue struck me, which  was how long ago some of the events addressed in the reports occurred. Some  Members referred to that. For example, Mr Dallat mentioned the review of  financial management in FE colleges, which goes back to 1998. I do not want to  get into the semantics of whether it is in our remit to examine issues that  occurred before the Assembly was set up, but the report deals with issues that  arose in the early years of this decade. Mr Beggs referred to a PFI contract  that was signed in March 2001. The report on the New Deal 25+ that the Committee  will consider next month goes back to 1998. The system has learned lessons and  has moved on.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Public Accounts Committee</strong>: The Minister has said that the system has  moved on. However, in examining the reports, the PAC is seeing that aspects of  the system have not moved on. Personnel may have changed, but I assure the  Minister that when the Committee asks questions about mistakes that have been  made in the past, we want Departments to learn from those mistakes and to  ensure that staff in all Departments will not make the same mistakes again.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: That is a laudable aim. No one will disagree with  that objective. My point is that some issues go back well over a decade. We are  looking at the effectiveness, efficiency and economy of the spending that is  being undertaken now; not processes that have been used in the past. We all  have a responsibility to ensure that taxpayers&rsquo; money is used economically,  efficiently and effectively.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  The report into the funding of FE colleges that the Minister mentioned covered  a period when there was considerable change and reorganisation of the colleges.  Does he agree that, given that the FE colleges have gone through an additional  review and reorganisation recently, there are lessons from the previous reorganisation  that had to be learned and should be applied to minimise losses and poor use of  public funds today?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I agree absolutely. That is not contrary to the  point that I am making.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In targeting a subject to investigate, the three &ldquo;Es&rdquo; should  be considered. The example that the Member has given refers to the effective  use of public money. Reports should be seeking to draw that out, but,  sometimes, they focus on the processes. The way in which the invest&shy;igations  and reports are structured leads people towards making sure that they have  ticked the right boxes in order to show that they have dealt with the process  as laid down, rather than make effective use of resources. If the latter is the  direction that the Committee is taking, and the objective that it has, it  should continue to undertake that role.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I will deal quickly with the points that Members have made.  First, Mr Wells and Mr Beggs referred to the report on managing sickness  absence. Mr Wells made his point in a humorous, but very telling, way. Why are  workers in certain Departments and certain parts of the public sector most  prone to illnesses on Friday afternoons and Mondays? Why are there higher rates  of absence in the public sector than in the private sector? Why are there huge  differences in absences rates between people who receive monthly salaries and  those who are paid on the basis of turning up for work?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We need to address the matter for two reasons. First, we  want to make more efficient use of our resources. Secondly, it is bad for the  morale of people who do not take time off to regularly have to cover for those  who do. I am pleased that the average level of absence, which was 12&middot;9 days in  2007-08, reduced to 10&middot;9 days in 2008-09. That is still below our target of 9&middot;7  days, but some progress has been made.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Wells</strong>:  That progress is commendable, but can the Minister explain why there should be  any inherent difference between absenteeism in the public sector and the  private sector? Absence levels in the public sector are still 50% above what  would be tolerated in a private company in Northern Ireland, yet the work is  largely similar. The overall target has to be to reduce the public sector&rsquo;s  average rate of absence to the same level as that of Northern Ireland  Electricity, for example, or, indeed, any shop or business in the Province.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I absolutely agree with the Member. It will not be a  case of resting once we have reached our target. We will continue our efforts  to push absence rates down, and more work needs to be done in all Departments.  I note what Mr Wells said about DRD and DARD. I do not know whether workers in  those Departments are scared of their respective Ministers, or whether those  Ministers give a better lead, as was suggested by Members on the Benches  opposite. However, it is good to see, whatever the reason. The variety in  absence rates across Departments perhaps indicates that it is a question of  management. We need to keep pushing the targets to improve on our current  record, and we are committed to addressing the issue on a continual basis.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Beggs and the Chairperson of the Public Accounts  Committee, Mr Paul Maskey, both raised the issue of rates collection. One of  the aims of PEDU&rsquo;s review of LPS was to deal with some of the very issues that  are highlighted in the PAC report. I believe, and, indeed, the PEDU report has  made it quite clear, that the core business of LPS should be the efficient  collection of local property taxes. Resources ought to be dedicated to that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I do not want to make excuses, but the process of  amalgamating four organisations into one, and implementing regular changes to  the rating system &mdash; indeed, earlier today, we passed more changes in the Rates  (Amendment) Bill &mdash; is bound to have an impact on the work of LPS. Nevertheless,  it is important, from the local councils&rsquo; point of view and as regards the  Executive&rsquo;s available revenue, that we have a proper database; that we know  where rates should be collected; that those rates are collected; and that we do  not find that some people pay rates while others are exempt from doing so. We  are working towards addressing that issue.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I will not be able to deal with all the comments that were  made by Members. Mr McGlone is not here, so, rather than dealing with the issue  that he raised, I will jump to shared services and Mr Shannon&rsquo;s point about fisheries  and the PAC&rsquo;s &lsquo;Report on Sea Fisheries: Vessel Modernisation and  Decommissioning Schemes&rsquo;.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">DARD has already acted on the recommendations of that  report prior to the introduction of any new grant schemes through the European  Fisheries Fund. It has completed a revision of the fleet futures analysis and  carried out a survey of the modernisation needs of the fleet. DARD also carried  out a comprehensive review of the economic appraisal and the project evaluation  requirements. Based on the PAC&rsquo;s recommendations, there have been further  improvements to the application and assessment and monitoring processes.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  Sometimes, the PAC&rsquo;s decisions are not about allocating money back to the  people; they can also be about returning money to the Department. For example,  when the Committee discussed sea fisheries, money went both ways.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I take the Member&rsquo;s point &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Unfortunately, the Minister&rsquo;s time is up. However, I will allow him to respond.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I have not responded to some Members&rsquo; points, and I  will seek to respond to them in writing. I am sorry that we have run out of time.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Public Accounts Committee</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I  suppose that one feature that maximises the effectiveness of the Public  Accounts Committee is that it is not within its remit to criticise Ministers or  their decisions. That is the role of the Statutory Committees. Instead, the  Public Accounts Committee focuses on regularity, propriety and getting best  value for money for public expenditure, and it calls for accounting officers to  justify spend on those counts and to defend the systems and controls that they  have put in place to safeguard taxpayers&rsquo; money. That makes for a Committee  that can focus on the common purpose of financial accountability, and rarely,  if ever, do party political concerns distract members from the business at  hand. Today&rsquo;s debate demonstrated just that, and I thank and commend my Committee  colleagues for their rigour and determination to speak out against waste, fraud  and inefficiency.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">If I may follow on from where the Minister left off, he is  correct to say that the Committee has made some 450 recommendations. That shows  the determination of the Committee to strive to ensure that public services here  are accountable. I remind the Minister that Members are elected by the people  of the North of Ireland to ensure that accountability is enshrined in all  Departments. We will tackle the issues.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Public Accounts Committee allows the public and  taxpayers to have faith in the system and, if things go wrong, to have faith  that the Committee and the Audit Office will provide scrutiny. We have made 450  recommendations, and I am sure that, over the next while, we will make probably  another 450 recommend&shy;ations. That is the poor thing about it, because as the  Minister&rsquo;s colleague Jim Wells stated, the Public Accounts Committee will be in  the business of making recommendations until it is no longer needed to do so.  The Minister is part of the Executive, and I suppose that it is up to  Departments to ensure that the mistakes that have been made in the past are no  longer made.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to add a point about risk. I have said on record  that the Committee, and I, as its Chairperson, welcome risk taking as long as  it is well calculated. For far too long we have seen Audit Office reports that  show the absolutely disgraceful expenditure that some Departments were able to  get away with for many years. The Minister is right to point out that some of  the reports go back a long time. However, for far too long we were, for want of  a better phrase, governed by direct rule, and there was very little scrutiny of  Departments at that stage. If mistakes were made then, it is wrong to continue  making the same mistakes. It is the Committee&rsquo;s job to drive home the message  that risk can be taken as long as it is well calculated.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I appreciate the Chairperson&rsquo;s point, but does he  recognise that risk taking sometimes means that processes may be cut short and,  for example, if a quick decision is required, there may not be an opportunity  to tick all the consultation boxes? The emphasis on process sometimes reduces  people&rsquo;s willingness to take risks, because, if the risk does not work out and  they are found guilty of cutting the process short, they are subject to  criticism in Audit Office reports.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Public Accounts Committee</strong>: Again, it is about what Departments do  with the Committee&rsquo;s recommendations. Even before the current Public Accounts  Committee, when we look at the failings that Trevor Lunn mentioned &mdash; which will  be in the report that will be published this Thursday &mdash; we can see that the IDB  did not adhere to some of the recommendations that were made on DeLorean.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">4.45 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In times gone by, Public Accounts Committees made  recommendations that Departments failed to implement. That failure is an  indictment of Departments, and it means that the same mistakes have been made  twice, which is wrong.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am thankful that the PAC is up and running and  challenging Departments. We will monitor the 450 recommendations that we have  made so far to determine which of them have been implemented. I must, however,  inform the Minister of Finance and Personnel that Departments agreed to most of  the 450 recommendations.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I would be surprised if Departments did not agree  the recommend&shy;ations. My point was that when recommendations are made and  accepted, their implementation and monitoring by Departments has an implication  for resources. Sometimes, those recommendations, because of something that  happened in the past, may introduce a note of caution into a Department that  militates against the taking of risks to get processes moving, which is what  the Chairperson of the Committee wants to encourage Departments to do.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Public Accounts Committee</strong>: The Committee is on record as saying that  well-calculated risks should be taken. However, how did people benefit from the  risks that banks took over the years? We are in the midst of a global financial  crisis. I hope that the banks will learn from their mistakes and ensure that we  move out of the global financial crisis.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that Departments in the North will learn from the  PAC&rsquo;s recommendations. No one should be afraid of the recommendations that we  ask Departments to implement, as they have agreed to most of them. The PAC&rsquo;s  purpose is not to make recommendations for the sake of it but to ensure that  Departments learn from the past and that we can move on together.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that the day will come when the PAC is no longer  needed, because Departments are working so well. I doubt, however, that that  day will ever come, because people will always make mistakes. The PAC aims to minimise  those mistakes and to ensure that they happen rarely. That will give everyone,  including taxpayers, confidence in the Executive. As the Chairperson of the PAC,  my heart is set on instilling confidence in society to have faith in us. We  must strive to create that confidence.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I will move on to some of the points that Members raised,  but I will not go into every detail. Several interesting points were raised.  Jonathan Craig and Jim Wells mentioned the PAC&rsquo;s visit to Altnagelvin, where we  saw facilities that were second to none. The visit to that amazing project in  Derry was the first time that the PAC had been outside Belfast.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is easy to go through reports and to ask questions of  Departments and the Audit Office. However, it is only on visiting the projects  that it becomes clear that the reports could have been worse. The PAC took an  important initiative in travelling to see the first-class facilities at  Altnagelvin. I echo the earlier point that the staff in the trust must be  highly commended for their hard work.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Deputy Chairperson, Roy Beggs, talked about public  funds and, in particular, the penny product. I am no longer a councillor,  although some Members still are. The miscalculation of the penny product had a drastic  effect on councils throughout the North of Ireland because staff had been  budgeting to progress certain projects. The miscalculation that affected  Belfast City Council, for example, was in the region of &pound;4 million.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It set councils back, because they had planned for the  future and had ensured that they had put all the checks and balances in place  regarding front line services, and yet there was a miscalculation of more than  &pound;4 million. That is wrong, and if it is wrong for Belfast City Council, it is  wrong for all others. A number of councils were caught out in that regard.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">John Dallat referred to arm&rsquo;s-length bodies as being  &ldquo;hands-off bodies&rdquo;: that phrase is well known among Committee members. He also  said, in relation to further education colleges, that &pound;44 million was, in his  terms, lying in the vaults. Some of the reports that have been published  concern ensuring that people learn and are educated. If that &pound;44 million had  been spent on education, it would have enabled a much greater number of people  to be educated and to gain employment opportunities or go back into further  education and perhaps on to university.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Trevor Lunn mentioned the national fraud initiative, and he  said that fraud is costing in the region of &pound;500 million a year. He informed  the Finance Minister that if that money were not being lost, then with respect  to the documents that were leaked last week, we would not need to have a  conversation about a shortfall of &pound;370 million. Fraud has a detrimental effect  on everything.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Jim Wells was a very valued member of the Public Accounts  Committee. I think that he said that he served on the Committee for 15 or 16  months. I actually thought that it was longer than that, but it may have just  seemed that way. However, he was a very influential person on the Committee and  always brought a bit of life to it. On that note, Jim Shannon raised an issue  regarding badgers, and I wondered how long it would take Mr Wells to get to his  feet and respond. Jim came to the defence of the badgers. From some of the  Committee&rsquo;s conversations, I know that John Dallat used to have a pet badger,  so he may have also been offended by that issue.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Patsy McGlone, who is not in the Chamber, is a new member  of the Committee. He mentioned the challenges for the Department of Finance and  Personnel. As well as those challenges that DFP must address, he highlighted  what the Committee could say to the Department about the recommendations that  are made.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Everyone who spoke in the debate mentioned the hard work of  John Dowdall during his stewardship of the Audit Office. As I said in my  opening remarks, we very much appreciate the hard work that was done, and the  dedication that was shown, by him and the entire staff of the Audit Office, as  well as our clerical team. When we were looking at some reports recently, we  noticed that it was a trainee in the Audit Office who highlighted the issue  regarding the Nomadic, which is a good sign for the Audit Office going forward.  The Minister may not agree with that because he could be challenged by the very  trainee who raised that issue.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>: I  thank the Member for giving way. As a former Chairperson of the Public Accounts  Committee, I put on record my appreciation of the work of John Dowdall during  my tenure. I found his assistance and advice invaluable, and the work that he  contributed to the Public Accounts Committee allows us, as a local Assembly, to  be more efficient in the delivery of our services.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Public Accounts Committee</strong>: I thank the Member for that intervention.  I also thank the Minister of Finance and Personnel for responding to the  Committee&rsquo;s work and to Members&rsquo; comments today about the concerns that drive  them. I agree entirely that the current economic period is the ideal time for  the PAC to work along with the Government to develop a constructive path  forward for efficiency in public services. That is a very important note.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">People have told me and other Committee members that our  Committee is the one that they want to stay clear of. I hope that that  represents their desire to work effectively, creatively and efficiently with  taxpayers&rsquo; money rather than being afraid of the individuals. As the previous  Chairperson of the Committee said, this is not a blood sport: it is about  ensuring delivery and value for money.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I also thank the civil servants who helped the Minister to  prepare for this debate. They are the same officials who assist the Treasury Officer  of Accounts in rolling out the PAC&rsquo;s recommend&shy;ations and in representing the  Department&rsquo;s views on financial guidance. The Committee and I are grateful for  their professionalism and support. Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat.</p>

      <p class="H4StageHeading">Social Tariff System</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour and 30 minutes for  the debate. The proposer will have 10 minutes in which to propose the motion  and 10 minutes in which to make a winding-up speech. All other Members will  have five minutes in which to speak. One amendment has been selected and  published on the Marshalled List. The proposer of the amendment will have 10  minutes in which to propose and five minutes in which to make a winding-up  speech. All other Members who wish to speak will have five minutes.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
      <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly calls on the Department of Enterprise,  Trade and Investment and the Department for Social Development to bring forward  a proposal to the Utility Regulator, NIE Energy and Phoenix Gas to introduce a  Social Tariff System to help people who are most vulnerable to fuel poverty.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the opportunity to debate the motion. Fuel  poverty has been widely discussed inside and outside the Chamber for some time.  We have listened to the debates and have heard all the parties&rsquo; perspectives on  the issue, yet fuel poverty still exists. We must seek innovative new  initiatives to alleviate fuel poverty. That is why I tabled the motion.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">At the outset, I am not indicating that any one Minister or  Department has full responsibility for tackling fuel poverty. The two  Departments that are named in the motion are those responsible for energy and  for social policy. I call on the Assembly to send out a united message that its  Members are really trying to find innovative ways in which to tackle the problem  and to help the most vulnerable people in society before we enter another  winter. We all remember the hardship that low-income families and the elderly  went through last year as a result of fuel poverty.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In the North of Ireland, the Government are responsible for  payments that help those vulnerable people to pay their energy bills. Customers  here do not have access to any form of social tariff, or affordable tariff, or  whatever people want to call it. We do not receive that luxury from either of  the two main suppliers of energy to households, which are NIE Energy and  Phoenix Natural Gas. Let me make it clear that I am not asking for other  domestic customers to pay for that social tariff; we want the energy companies  to pay most of it, with some costs being met by larger commercial businesses.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">That there is no competition here means that we are in a  unique situation. NIE Energy and Phoenix Natural Gas have market monopolies. An  independent review commissioned last year following huge electricity price  hikes recommended changes in how the system is regulated. The Department of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment&rsquo;s draft strategic energy framework 2009  consultation provides an opportunity to ensure that the system is changed to  become more transparent and fairer to customers, particularly NIE Energy  customers.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Members know that Douglas McIldoon&rsquo;s report sets out a  number of recommendations, including extending the two-month purchasing period  for electricity and reviewing whether to continue payments to backup power stations.  That raises generation costs, which are passed on to the customer. The report  also identifies other issues, such as the guaranteed profit margin of NIE  Energy and the impact of using dual currency for the single electricity market,  both of which contribute to the customer&rsquo;s paying more. More public debate is  needed on those issues.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We have heard in debates that three factors cause fuel  poverty: a home&rsquo;s energy efficiency; the cost of heating fuel; and family  income. I am also conscious that most households here &mdash; I think that the figure  is 70% &mdash; use oil for heating. However, we must also take a particular look at  electricity, which almost every household uses.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">5.00 pm</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  Does the Member agree that omitting oil from the motion is detrimental to the  energy strategy, because closing the competitive gap between gas and oil will  not encourage people to move away from oil? Any social tariff that puts up the  price of gas, which, as everybody knows, is much more energy-efficient and  environmentally beneficial, will dissuade people from moving from oil to gas  and could harm our energy strategy.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  I did not mention oil in the motion because the regulator is not responsible  for it. As I said in my opening remarks, I am not asking for household  customers to pay for social tariffs; it should be the energy companies, which  make huge profits here.</p>
      <p class="B3SpeakerinChair">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Molloy] in the Chair)</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">At present, 34% of households here with children live in  fuel poverty, compared to 16% in the South of Ireland and only 7% in England &mdash;  although even 7% is too many. In addition, up to 40% of people who live in fuel  poverty are elderly.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>:  Although the introduction of social tariffs for all vulnerable groups would be  most welcome and is, indeed, necessary, does the Member accept that the elderly  are most at risk from fuel poverty? Between 2001 and 2007, 1,997 older people  in the North died from cold-related illnesses.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  I accept the Member&rsquo;s point. In addition, the money to alleviate fuel poverty  would be saved in other areas, such as services that deal with people&rsquo;s health  and well-being.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The sectors that are most vulnerable to fuel poverty are  the elderly and low-income families, particularly lone parents, many of whom  have to work part-time due to their need for flexible working hours.  Furthermore, the recent rise in unemployment will result in more families  becoming vulnerable to fuel poverty.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In the North, the Government are responsible for payments  to assist vulnerable customers with their energy bills, mainly in the form of  one-off winter fuel payments to the elderly. Customers do not have access to  social or affordable tariffs from either of the two main local energy  suppliers, NIE Energy and Phoenix Natural Gas. In addition, customers cannot  switch suppliers, so they do not have the choice that customers have elsewhere.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In the South, the Government operate a system of free gas  and electricity units as part of a household benefits package, which is  available to low-income and elderly households, all people over the age of 70, carers  and people with disabilities. Recently, the amount of gas and electricity that  is provided free of charge there increased. As part of the welfare system in  the South, the Government fund a national fuel scheme, which is a means-tested  benefit that provides a weekly fuel allowance to low-income households that are  in receipt of certain qualifying payments. The allowance is payable for 29  weeks, from the end of September until the middle of April.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The scheme that operates in the South has been highlighted  by organisations such as National Energy Action, which used the scheme to  bolster its campaign for the Government to become more involved in regulating  social or affordable tariffs. The National Energy Action campaign is based on  its concern that the matter is being left to the discretion of the energy industry,  and that is why I have asked the two Ministers to take this matter forward.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Government must be more proactive in developing social  or affordable tariffs, which should not be left solely to the energy companies.  Some of the energy companies in Britain  have admitted that even the extra &pound;225 million that they have pledged for  social assistance is inadequate. Organisations that represent the elderly, such  as Age Concern, have called for the introduction of a mandatory social tariff  to help the most vulnerable households.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Given that energy companies make huge profits here and that  energy prices here are higher, those companies have a corporate social  responsibility to offer social or affordable tariffs to the households that  need them. Whatever Members want to call such tariffs, we need to ensure that,  this winter, those who are most vulnerable to fuel poverty are given the help  that they need. Although I would like to see that assistance being given this  winter, it might take some time. I want to see negotiations with the energy  companies start now.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to stress that individual Ministers who have the  responsibility for identifying vulnerable households, such as the Minister for  Social Development, and for energy policy, such as the Minister of Enterprise,  Trade and Investment, must enter into negotiations with NIE Energy and Phoenix  Natural Gas to take this forward. That is why I singled out those Ministers in  the motion.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">All of us have a social responsibility to help those most  disadvantaged in society. Energy companies and the larger commercial customers  should pay for this, rather than other domestic customers. Social tariffs,  taken in isolation, will not eradicate fuel poverty, but as part of an overall  package they will definitely help vulnerable households this winter.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Simpson</strong>:  I beg to move the following amendment: Leave out all after &ldquo;Assembly&rdquo; and  insert</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;, being mindful of the alarmingly high levels of fuel  poverty in Northern Ireland and the negative impact high energy prices have on  the fuel poor, calls on the Minister for Social Development to work with her  Executive colleagues to obtain an accurate assessment of actual need in respect  of fuel poverty; notes that social tariffs could result in higher prices for a  significant number of households and businesses; and urges consideration of a  range of options to assist people most vulnerable to fuel poverty.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The motion calls on the Executive:</p>
      <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;to help people who are most vulnerable to fuel poverty.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">It is hard to disagree with that sentiment. It is  only right and proper that we do all we can to help the most vulnerable members  of society. Fuel poverty is a problem throughout the United   Kingdom, but it is a particular problem in Northern Ireland.  High energy prices adversely impact on thousands of householders, with  resultant damage not only to incomes but to health. Last winter the Executive  sought to do what they could, and in his December monitoring statement my  colleague the former Finance Minister Nigel Dodds announced &pound;15 million to  alleviate fuel poverty. A &pound;150 payment was made to 100,000 households in  receipt of income support or pension credits.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The motion may be well-meaning and superficially  attractive, but it is fundamentally flawed. There is a danger that, in seeking  to help those caught in the fuel poverty trap, we adversely impact on other  sections of society. In short, we are in danger of robbing Peter to pay Paul.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">If we introduce social tariffs, it will cost &pound;76 million to  provide a &pound;300 payment to the 34% of households in Northern Ireland that are estimated  to be fuel poor. How will that cost be met? How can the Government, faced with  ever-increasing pressures on already-limited resources, find that sort of money  to subsidise the fuel poor? If the Government cannot pay, do we turn to the  energy companies? That is not a realistic proposition either. The energy  companies are already limited to a profit margin of 1&middot;5% and do not have the scope  to subsidise customers directly. If pressure is applied to the energy companies  to encourage them to pay, it will merely be a disincentive to further  competition in the Northern    Ireland energy market. The only other option  is to pass on the cost of the social tariff to other consumers. Hard-pressed  and hard-working families along with local firms and small businesses, already  struggling in a recession, will face higher energy bills in order to subsidise  the fuel poor.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  NIE Energy alone made a profit of &pound;120 million for shareholders last year. Its  profit margin may be limited, but the profit is still large.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  It was reinvested.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Simpson</strong>:  My colleague has shouted it out before I got to it.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Energy companies make substantial reinvestments. The Member  also sits on the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment, which only  last week was told that all energy companies were limited to a profit margin of  1&middot;5%. Therefore, a substantial amount of money is reinvested.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I believe that the motion is a dangerous option. Let us  look at the broader picture and consider the likely impact of such a move. It  would plunge other families below the fuel poverty line. It could push  businesses over the edge and into closure, with the result that more workers  will join the dole queue and add to the fuel poor. Surely the proposers of the  motion do not want that outcome. In seeking to correct one social injustice, we  must be very careful not to create others. In seeking to cut off the head of  the fuel poverty monster, we could enable it to grow more heads.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We need a full and accurate assessment of actual need in  relation to fuel poverty. We urge the Minister for Social Development, in  co-operation with her Executive colleagues, to conduct such an investigation  urgently. There are cases in which circumstances dictate that it is almost  inevitable that a person or household will find themselves in a fuel poverty  trap. For example, a single pensioner, a lone parent, or a household with an  annual income below &pound;7,000 could easily slip into fuel poverty. However, for  all the cases that are black and white, there are many that are grey, where the  issue is less to do with income than with energy efficiency. In other words,  throwing money at fuel poverty is not always the answer.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I commend the hard work that has been done by my colleagues  the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment and the Minister of Finance  and Personnel to introduce and encourage energy efficiency initiatives; that is  one of the main keys that will help us to unlock this problem. Ideas such as  enhancing the fuel efficiency of homes; converting homes to use more efficient  fuels; encouraging more use of pay-as-you-go and keypads, which offer the  lowest possible price; and reforming a system that favours electricity  generators over consumers need to be explored and encouraged.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">At the start of my comments, I mentioned the high energy  prices in Northern Ireland, but it is worth remembering that, in January,  electricity prices fell by 10&middot;8% and gas prices fell by just over 22%. A  further review resulted in prices falling again this week, which is good news  for all families and businesses.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Whatever way we address fuel poverty, and it must be  addressed, let us not fall into the trap of undoing the progress that is being  made. Knee-jerk reactions, as Members opposite never tire of telling us, are  not the best sort of reactions. The motion has a hint of a knee-jerk about it,  and that is the reason for the amendment. I commend the amendment to the House.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and  Investment (Mr A Maginness)</strong>: I speak as Chairperson of the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and  Investment. This is my first opportunity to address the House as Chairperson.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee agrees that there should be some mechanism to  assist those in fuel poverty to ease the burden of energy costs. However, I  emphasise that the Committee has not rushed into proposals for how that should  be achieved in practice. Part of the reason for that is that the issue is not  as simple as it might first appear.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Stephen McCully, the managing director of NIE Energy,  speaking on &lsquo;Good Morning Ulster&rsquo; on 15 September, said that the 2&middot;5% discount  offered by the keypad pay-as-you-go system represents a very good social tariff.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">When such statements are made, it is important to define  what is meant by a social tariff. Ofgem defines it as a tariff that is at least  as good as the lowest tariff offered to customers in an area. DSD defines it as  the lowest possible tariff offered by suppliers to vulnerable or low income  consumers, regardless of the payment method.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">5.15 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Direct debit customers receive a 4% discount from NIE.  Therefore, the pay-as-you-go system is not as good as the lowest tariff and is  not the lowest possible tariff offered to customers. In fact, it represents a  1&middot;5% surcharge over and above that paid by direct debit customers. To describe  it as a social tariff might be considered as misleading by some. Under Ofgem  and DSD&rsquo;s definitions, a 4% discount for keypad pay-as-you-go customers,  similar to that enjoyed by direct debit customers, would represent a social  tariff.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As I said, the issue of social tariffs is not as simple as  it might first appear, and there is a number of reasons for that. Not least of  those reasons is the issue of who pays. We have had some discussion about that.  DETI officials have told the Committee that social tariffs are not a means to  reduce NIE Energy&rsquo;s profits, but operate by spreading the additional costs  among other consumers. On the other hand, the Consumer Council believes that the  energy companies must make a valid and significant contribution to social  tariffs. Suppliers, however, believe that they should not have to pay. Should  companies, such as NIE Supply, Phoenix Gas and Firmus Energy have a role in  paying for some social tariffs? That is a reasonable question.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Should other organisations that are contributing to the  electricity tariff, such as the generators and those claiming network system  costs and supply costs, have a role in paying for social tariffs? Should the  Government or councils have a role in paying for social tariffs?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There are higher levels of fuel poverty here than in Britain. What  will a social tariff system cost here? Electricity prices are already 12%  higher here than in GB. If ordinary consumers have to pay, how much will such a  tariff add to their fuel bills? I know that some Members are resisting that  imposition, and that is a fair position to adopt.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">If someone uses more electricity than their neighbour  because, for example, they have a family or because they are a carer, will they  have to make a higher contribution to the social tariff through a flat-rate  system, or will there be a fixed-rate contribution from all consumers? What  about those in fuel poverty who do not have access to gas and who rely on oil  or coal for heat? Will they be excluded from this aspect of a social tariff?  What will the administration costs be? Would it be less costly to provide help  to those in fuel poverty through the benefits system, so that there is already  clarity around who would be entitled, rather than to set up and administer a  whole new system?</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee supports the introduction of a mechanism to  ease the burden of those in fuel poverty. However, the questions that I have  asked today are reasonable, and it remains for the Committee to make its mind  up fully on the issue.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Armstrong</strong>:  The motion deals with a subject that is of great interest to many thousands of  people in Northern Ireland  who are affected by fuel poverty and the high energy prices. The Ulster  Unionist Party is committed to tackling those issues. In 2004, 23% of  households in Northern    Ireland were in fuel poverty, and that rose  to 34% by 2006. The cost of domestic electricity increased by 36% between  January and October 2008, and, in the same period, the cost of domestic natural  gas increased by 19%.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The rate of fuel poverty in Northern   Ireland is almost three times the level that it is in England. We  must focus on what we are trying to achieve and ensure that the lowest possible  tariffs are provided to vulnerable or low-income consumers in Northern Ireland,  regardless of their payment method.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Currently, no supplier in Northern Ireland offers social  tariffs to customers. Although social tariffs may be part of the solution, they  are not the entire solution. Indeed, the Northern Ireland Fuel Poverty Advisory  Group has said:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Social tariffs offered in isolation will not  eradicate fuel poverty.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Several initiatives have already been introduced by various  bodies in an attempt to combat fuel poverty in Northern Ireland. Those initiatives  include schemes from the Housing Executive, the Department for Social  Development&rsquo;s warm homes scheme, winter fuel allowances and the Assembly&rsquo;s  one-off fuel payment of &pound;150.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister for Social Development established a fuel  poverty task force in May 2008, and among its recommendations on how to tackle  fuel poverty, which were published in September 2008, was the need to examine  the feasibility of the introduction of social tariffs. In light of that, the  Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment has confirmed that the Utility  Regulator has been working internally in that area and has employed consultants  to undertake a policy analysis for the implementation of a social tariff in Northern Ireland.  That analysis includes an examination of the potential positive and negative  impacts that are associated with different options, and the Minister has also  stated that the next steps in that process will include a public consultation  on the report.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, work is in hand, and, consequently, it would be  wise to await the outcome of that consultation. At that point, we can make an  informed decision.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Neeson</strong>: I  welcome today&rsquo;s debate, because as the Chairperson of the Committee for Social  Development said, the Committee has been dealing with the issue of social  tariffs for some time.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Fuel poverty is higher in Northern   Ireland than in any other part of the UK, with 34% of  the population living in fuel poverty. Research has shown that a reduced tariff,  based on personal circumstances &mdash; a social tariff &mdash; is the most popular type of  financial support that can be offered to those who have trouble paying their  energy bills.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In other parts of the UK, energy providers have offered  social tariffs to help their most vulnerable customers. Indeed, all energy  providers in GB must offer social tariffs to help their most vulnerable  customers to cope with the high costs of gas and electricity. Those companies also  offer a range of other services such as free insulation, boiler checks and  advice to fuel-poor customers, particularly elderly people and those on low  incomes.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">British Gas&rsquo;s Essentials tariff is the UK&rsquo;s largest social  tariff, and it aims to reduce the gas and electricity prices of 75,000 of the  company&rsquo;s most vulnerable customers. Those customers&rsquo; energy bills will drop by  some &pound;307 a year. The tariff also provides extra help to vulnerable customers,  particularly those who use pay-as-you-go energy meters, which, despite helping  those on low incomes to budget, are often a more costly way to pay for gas and  electricity.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">E.ON&rsquo;s social tariff, StayWarm, is specifically designed to  help vulnerable customers who are over the age of 60. It is a fixed price  tariff that keeps costs the same for 12 months after a customer has signed up  to it. E.ON also offers free loft and cavity wall insulation to anyone over the  age of 70 or to those receiving certain benefits, such as income support,  housing benefit, council tax benefit or income-based jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance, whether  or not they are customers. E.ON customers who are over the age of 60 can also  switch to the Age Concern tariff, which could save them an average of &pound;69.  Those customers also receive safety and energy efficiency gadgets, such as  energy-saving light bulbs and carbon monoxide detectors.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is not just a question of refunding money; it is also  about making customers more energy-efficient, and that is an issue that we need  to address in Northern    Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">EDF Energy&rsquo;s assist tariff is aimed at those customers who  have to spend more than 10% of their household income on gas and electricity or  those receiving income support or pension credit, giving a 15% discount on  EDF&rsquo;s standard energy prices. About 57,000 customers benefit from that reduced  tariff, which is applied directly to those customers with standard or economy 7  meters, while those with prepayment or complex metering will atomically receive  a rebate each year.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">ScottishPower&rsquo;s carefree plus social tariff offers eligible  customers a saving of up to &pound;112 a year on their energy bills. Customers on the  new tariff will also be able to have free insulation work done on their homes  and receive a benefits health check to ensure that they receive all the help to  which they are entitled.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Neeson</strong>: I  am sorry; I do not have the time.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">A considerable number of consumers in Northern Ireland  still use household coal, domestic heating oil and liquefied petroleum gas, and  there is no control over the distributors of those fuels. The point was rightly  made that some mechanism should be developed to bring the sale and distribution  of those energy products under control.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Moutray</strong>:  I support the amendment in the names of my colleagues David Simpson and Simon  Hamilton. By securing the amendment, they have injected an important element of  common sense into the debate on energy in general and on fuel poverty in  particular.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Fuel poverty concerns us all, as it has a serious financial  and health effect on too many households in Northern Ireland. We all agree that  it must be tackled robustly, but how? A social tariff is not the answer.  Indeed, there is a danger that we could make a bad situation worse by  suggesting that we throw money at the problem without properly analysing the  issues. That is why the amendment urges the Minister for Social Development to  work with her colleagues to assess fully the extent and nature of fuel poverty.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We must examine a range of options to help those who are  worst off. We also need to ensure that in helping the worst off, more people  and businesses are not adversely affected as a result. Since last winter, as Mr  Simpson said, the price of electricity and gas has fallen twice. That is good  news for all customers, and we need to see more of that, as it should help to  reduce the number of homes caught in the fuel-poverty trap.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs McGill</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I welcome Minister Foster&rsquo;s  presence in the Chamber.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I have listened to the Members who have spoken so far, and  I understand why Members on the DUP Benches referred to getting a more refined  definition of fuel poverty. Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s motion provides that opportunity in the  best circumstances. There is confusion around fuel poverty. Are the right  people targeted and are the most vulnerable identified correctly? As my party colleague  Jennifer McCann said, we have these debates from time to time. However, we must  get clarity on the issue and we must take it a step further.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">5.30 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am not a member of the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment, so I am not  privy to all the detail and nuances of the debate, but it is important that the  social tariff get an airing. I will be disappointed if the House divides on the  issue.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Assembly&rsquo;s Research and Library Service for  providing an information pack on the issue. It refers to &lsquo;The Utility  Regulator&rsquo;s Social Action Plan 2009-2014&rsquo;, which, I understand, contains a  proposal, as part of the regulator&rsquo;s forward work programme, to produce a  scoping framework document in 2009-2010 that will refer specifically to  introducing a social tariff system. It is significant that that suggestion will  be made by the regulator.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The information pack also contains a replication of the  joint paper commissioned by the Consumer Council and the Utility Regulator. The  research in that document comes out in favour of the social tariff system. I  took some statistics from that document. It mentions three options, but the  option that is favoured by 64% in a particular age group is the social tariff.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I think that Mr Maginness referred to people on benefits  and the fact that there is clarity on their position at the moment, but the  document that I mentioned contains statistics showing that 66% of those not on  benefits favoured the social tariff for those in financial difficulty and fuel  poverty and that 60% of those on benefits also favoured it. Almost the same  percentage of those who are on benefits favour the social tariff as of those  who are not on benefits.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to make another point about who pays for it all. As  my party colleague said, our position is that the consumer should not pay for  it, and I am fully in agreement with that. Other Members also mentioned that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Consumer Council, in its response to the Utility  Regulator&rsquo;s social action plan &mdash; again I refer to the information pack &mdash; said:</p>
      <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Social tariffs are potentially an important tool with  which to tackle fuel poverty. The Consumer Council is strongly of the opinion  that social tariffs must not be solely funded by other consumers but that  energy companies must make a valid and significant contribution.&rdquo;</p>
      <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">My party is proposing the social tariff system, and  I am prepared to take the views of the Consumer Council on board. Go raibh  maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>: I  support the amendment, as it is the best means of addressing fuel poverty.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">First things first: as any good auditor acknowledges, we  need to know the extent of the problem if we are to tackle it effectively. In  this case, an accurate appraisal of what is required is the order of the day. I  encourage the Minister to be proactive in response and to use the expertise and  knowledge base of her Executive colleagues and the intelligence and data in  their respective Departments to deliver a computation of need that can be stood  over with a high degree of certainty.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">All of us note the high energy prices that we in Northern Ireland  pay. That, coupled with poor energy efficiencies and low income, creates in  many cases a negative situation, which leaves many of our households fuel poor  and living with the difficulties and complexities of fuel poverty. We cannot  afford to ignore the high level of fuel poverty. It is a red flashing light  that rightly alerts and warns public representatives that something must be  done. I reiterate that high energy prices have a detrimental impact on the fuel  poor. That is a fact that we cannot afford to ignore.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Many tools can be utilised to tackle fuel poverty, and we  would be well advised to consider all options. The amendment is essentially  correct in that a one-size-fits-all approach is the incorrect response to the  complexities of fuel poverty.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I strongly contend that the research base showing that a  social tariff system will act as some form of panacea to the woes of fuel  poverty does not exist. In my analysis, there is no evidence base to justify a  social tariff system as a mechanism to adequately address fuel poverty. We  certainly do not wish to introduce a measure that, in seeking to address one  problem by tackling fuel poverty, creates further harm by placing higher bills  on the budgets of a significant number of other households. That would be a  false economy. We must be careful, because many households that are taking a  prudent approach to the household purse in difficult economic circumstances are  genuinely fearful of increased bills leading to debt.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">If the social tariff model is followed blindly, it should  be anticipated that many households and the business community, which is taking  the difficult economic strain, would be put in the position of facing mounting  bills. We do not wish to take that direction or go down that route. Rather,  like any good general, we should consider using all the weapons in our arsenal  that have the capacity to minimise the number of households that have to live  in fuel poverty. The public would, rightly, look aghast at us if we were to do  otherwise.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We must look to energy efficiency. Too much energy is lost,  and the energy resource is drained by poor housing and inadequate insulation.  That is a key area, which, if effectively tackled, will reduce the number of  households living with fuel poverty. Therefore, that and many other options  must be further explored. Lead responsibility lies with the Department for  Social Development, and many factors cut across other Depart&shy;ments. The issues  of proper and effective insulation, to which the amendment speaks, will not  only drive down costs and place fewer people in fuel poverty but will prove to  be the environmentally friendly option. People do not wish to throw good money  after bad because their boiler is underperforming. The amendment aims to  address that, and it speaks to all the positive environmental benefits. I  recommend it to the House.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>: The  issue is an important and emotive one, and I thank the Members who tabled the  motion and those who tabled the amendment.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Fuel poverty is a real and persistent problem. Between 2004  and 2006, an additional 60,000 households in Northern Ireland entered fuel  poverty. In light of rising fuel costs and increases in unemployment, there are  concerns that the number of people who are fuel poor has reached unprecedented  levels. Fuel poverty is caused by a combination of factors, including poor  household energy efficiency, low income and expensive fuel.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, numerous potential solutions and ameliorating  policies are open to us, of which a social tariff is one. I note and commend  the actions that the Executive have already taken: the warm homes scheme, Housing  Executive programmes and the one-off payment of &pound;150 to people who are on  income support and pension credit. It is obvious that the Executive and the  Assembly are taking the issue seriously.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">At first glance, the proposition to introduce a social  tariff is attractive, because it reflects our desire to help the people who are  most in need. However, given Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s energy market, the make-up of the energy  supply and the pricing system, such a proposition must be given careful  scrutiny and thought. I note that the Fuel Poverty Task Force recommended that  a study into a social tariff be carried out and that the Utility Regulator has  undertaken investigations that he plans to report to the Minister of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment. That is the correct way to address the issue.  No guarantees or decisions should be given until we have all the facts.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The DUP amendment recognises those concerns. I note that an  NIE briefing paper estimates that the cost of introducing a social tariff could  lead to an increase of between 8% and 12% in electricity prices for all other  users. In light of pressures that families already face due to increases in  energy prices &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  A couple of Members have suggested that households will have to pick up the  bill for social tariffs. That does not have to be the case. Energy companies  and larger commercial businesses should pick up the bulk of that.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>:  That is a nice idea. However, unfortunately, a monopoly applies in Northern Ireland.  The actual margin for the electricity company, in particular, is fixed.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>: I am  concerned about getting through my wee bit. If the Member is quick, I will give  way.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  Does the Member agree that passing the cost on to big business, however that is  defined, will act as a disincentive to attracting that type of business to Northern Ireland  and, indeed, could put people in those businesses out of work and thus create a  vicious circle in which more people are trapped in fuel poverty?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>: The  Member is quite correct. Now, to get back to my point, for which, I am sure,  Members are all waiting &mdash;<span class="Italic"> [Laughter.]</span></p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In light of pressures that families already face due to  increased energy costs, rising unemployment and the ongoing recession, such an  increase could be detrimental, not only to the people who are involved, but to  the entire economy. That point has just been made by Mr Hamilton.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Social tariffs exist in Great Britain. They were introduced  initially to enable customers to access electricity at the lowest available  rate, regardless of the method of payment. That issue arose from the fact that  pre-payment customers in GB paid around &pound;100 per annum more than those who paid  by other means, such as direct debit or credit card. That situation is not as  prevalent in Northern    Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, it must be recognised that the virtual  monopolies that exist in Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s gas and electricity markets have  resulted in much tighter net profit margins, greater regulation, and much  smaller scope for companies to subsidise customers directly, or, indeed, for  customers to shop around for the best deals.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Fuel poverty is a major issue. It is a top priority for the  Ulster Unionist Party. The strategic energy framework provides an opportunity  to address some of the structural and underlying problems that create fuel  poverty and which can limit the Assembly&rsquo;s options to solving it.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly looks forward to the findings of the Utility  Regulator on the potential for a social tariff and the possible ramifications  of introducing one. In the meantime, efforts must continue to reduce fuel poverty  by increasing energy-efficiency measures in the home, ensuring maximum benefit  uptake, and ensuring that all people who are eligible for the &pound;150 one-off  payment take it.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I support the amendment.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  The debate is worthwhile because the social tariff is an important, though not  an easy, issue. The Chairperson of the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment made a  number of good points. Incidentally, it is clear that if the motion were  carried, the matter would be DETI&rsquo;s responsibility.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">To set social tariffs is a worthy concept, but a difficult one  to carry through. There are considerable difficulties in realising that, which  the Assembly needs to be mature enough to recognise.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Everyone recognises that three broad factors affect fuel  poverty. They are energy costs, household income and household fuel efficiency,  which has two elements: insulation standards and the efficiency of the heating  system. Any programme to tackle fuel poverty must involve measures that deal  with all three of those factors, not just one.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Measures that are already in place include the warm homes  scheme, which is one of the Executive&rsquo;s key responses. The scheme is operated  by the Department for Social Development. It has been hugely successful and  very popular. Since 2001, more than &pound;118 million has been spent on the scheme  and, as a result, about 71,000 houses have been made warmer.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">5.45 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Members will be aware of the new warm homes scheme, the  managers of which are H&amp;A Mechanical Services Ltd and Byrson Charitable  Group. That scheme will better target resources so that those most in need get  the most assistance. We should welcome the fact that for the first time, young  families that are in receipt of working tax credits can benefit from  improvements to their home-heating systems and that people over 60 can also  benefit from the scheme.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We all know about the budgetary pressures on DSD in respect  of housing. Despite that, &pound;20&middot;5 million has been allocated to the warm homes  scheme this year, and that should assist 10,000 households. Therefore, good  work is being done in that area.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">DSD also looks after the public housing stock, one element  of which is the conversion of houses to natural gas. More than 29,000  home-heating systems in Housing Executive properties have already been converted;  however, DSD wants that conversion to be extended much more widely. That, of  course, depends on the extension of the gas network, the need for which we are  all starting to recognise. New social houses are being built to a very high  standard and with a minimum code level 3 environmental rating, which makes them  25% more energy-efficient than before. Those are all relevant measures.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Maximising income is important. The focus on the economy  and on getting more and better-paid jobs has its place in tackling fuel  poverty. Of course, many of those who suffer fuel poverty are dependent on  social security benefits. DSD&rsquo;s measures are extremely important in making  people aware of the role of child tax credits, working tax credits and pension  credits.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Benefit uptake is also extremely important, and DSD has run  successful campaigns that have given a great deal of money to families and  brought extra money into Northern    Ireland.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">DSD also administers the winter fuel payment. Although we  want that payment to be increased, it makes a significant contribution to  household budgets. The Executive&rsquo;s household fuel payment gave out no less than  &pound;24&middot;5 million in April by distributing &pound;150 payments to 167,000 homes.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">To tackle the issue, we must look at the measures already in  place to make each one better by being open to new ideas. The concept of a  social tariff certainly deserves study. I am uncomfortable with the amendment,  because it is too sweeping in its rejection of the social tariff concept. As I  said, although the concept is difficult to realise, it is definitely worthy of  examination.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment (Mrs Foster)</strong>: I welcome the opportunity to discuss the issue,  and I congratulate the Members who tabled the motion. This discussion is timely  because the strategic energy framework is the subject of a consultation process,  which a number of Members pointed out. That framework acknowledges the high  levels of fuel poverty in Northern    Ireland and emphasises my Department&rsquo;s  continued commitment to work with the Department for Social Development on  areas of mutual policy development to ensure that fuel poverty issues can be  addressed.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I noted with some amusement Mr O&rsquo;Loan&rsquo;s comment that if the  motion were carried, the issue would be mine and mine alone to address. He then  went on to tell the House about all the things that DSD does to address fuel  poverty. I am not sure where all that sits. Nevertheless, he will be glad to  know that Minister Ritchie and I work together to address those issues, and  that that is recognised in the strategic energy framework.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The framework acknowledges that the Government are, as the  Member pointed out, already working hard to ensure access to secure,  competitively priced and sustainable energy supplies, while &mdash; and this is  important &mdash; supporting economic growth as well. The framework also acknowledges  that the era of cheap energy is over &mdash; something that we are all acutely aware  of &mdash; that we must be more energy efficient and that we must seek to reduce our  energy consumption.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Given the publication today of a report by Invest NI, it is  appropriate that DETI&rsquo;s role, and my primary focus as economy Minister, is on  business competitiveness. My Department&rsquo;s goal is to grow a dynamic, innovative  economy, and the Programme for Government states that growing a dynamic,  innovative economy is the Executive&rsquo;s top priority for the period 2008 to 2011.  A key element in supporting that priority is ensuring that there is a  fit-for-purpose energy policy in Northern Ireland. We are very much  committed to ensuring an efficient, diverse, competitive and sustainable energy  market that offers economic opportunity to businesses in Northern Ireland.  We will work to ensure that energy costs are as low as possible for all  consumers, consistent with maintaining adequate incentives for investment in  energy assets for security of supply, irrespective of the investment being  provided from equity-based or mutualised company models.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">What has caused the high prices in energy? As elsewhere,  the main driver for retail gas and electricity prices in Northern Ireland  is the global price of wholesale gas. In 2008, global increases in the price of  wholesale gas increased the price of gas, oil, coal and electricity for all  energy consumers, including those already in fuel poverty.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am pleased that, in late 2008, the Utility Regulator  initiated separate reviews of the natural gas tariffs of Phoenix Supply Ltd in  the greater Belfast licence area, and the  electricity tariffs of NIE Energy throughout Northern Ireland. That led to the  gas and electricity tariff reduction of 22&middot;1% and 10&middot;8% respectively in January  2009. A further tariff review resulted in an announcement by Phoenix of a 19% reduction in gas prices, and  in a 17&middot;7% price reduction for domestic consumers with Firmus Energy. From 1  October 2009, NIE Energy&rsquo;s 5% reduction in domestic electricity prices will  come into effect. Those price reductions for consumers are particularly welcome  given the significant economic difficulties that are being faced by many at the  present time. I think that that needs to be acknowledged.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the debate on possible measures on electricity  prices that would help hard-pressed customers. That said, I think it is  important that we continue to focus energy policy on improving business  competitiveness and on ensuring that we have a secure and sustainable energy  future for all consumers. For example, as was mentioned, the Department  supports the continued expansion of the natural gas network to provide  additional fuel choices for consumers. The Department and the Utility Regulator  are looking at the potential extension of the natural gas network in Northern Ireland,  and I am very much looking forward to that vital piece of work being completed.  I think that that will be welcomed across the Chamber, and I know that people  will look forward to receiving it.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Department plans to undertake a study to determine the  economic cost-benefit analysis of implementing smart metering in domestic  properties and micro-businesses in Northern Ireland. We have consulted  on better billing and metering in Northern Ireland. The Electricity  and Gas (Billing) Regulations (Northern    Ireland) 2009 requires suppliers to provide  12 months&rsquo; worth of historical consumption data on energy bills. That will allow  consumers to be better informed about their usage and to make more informed  choices about energy use and energy efficiency.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As has been recognised by a number of Members, DSD works to  address fuel poverty, too. In particular, the House will recall the one-off  fuel payment of &pound;150 that was made to vulnerable homes, which we heard about  earlier in the debate.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that we have an evaluation of how that  scheme was rolled out. The House will then need to consider whether the action  that was taken was the best way to deal with fuel poverty last winter or  whether there are more appropriate measures to help vulnerable households.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Other Government initiatives were mentioned in the debate,  including the warm homes scheme, through which DARD has provided funding to  specifically target rural homes; the Social Security Agency&rsquo;s benefit uptake campaign;  and, as I said, the winter fuel payment. All those initiatives help with fuel  poverty.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There has been a lot of talk about the profit made by  energy companies, but Members need to acknowledge that those companies are  doing things to help. For example, the vulnerable customer programme, which is  called For Your Benefit, is managed by NIE Energy. That programme assists  vulnerable customers with identifying and claiming the various publicly funded  benefits to which they are entitled. There are also customer-care registers  operated by electricity- and gas-supply companies, which aim to keep a record  of vulnerable customers so that the appropriate level of support can be  offered.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There has been a lot of talk today about prepayment meters.  It is important to say that Northern    Ireland prepayment customers do not pay more  than other customers, unlike their counterparts in GB. That is the result of a  voluntary agreement established by the electricity- and gas-supply companies,  working with the Utility Regulator. NIE Energy prepayment customers are offered  a discount of 2&middot;5% compared with standard credit customers, and natural gas  customers are offered a prepay tariff that is equivalent to the standard-credit  tariff. In other words, NIE Energy customers who prepay get a 2&middot;5% reduction.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Chairperson of the Committee gave us definitions of a  social tariff, and I would expect nothing less from him. He said that, because  direct-debit customers receive a 4% reduction on the standard tariff, the  prepayment method was not, in effect, a social tariff. I acknowledge that, but  he must acknowledge that we have a better system than the one that is available  in GB, because there is at least an incentive to prepay. Other schemes include  Firmus Energy&rsquo;s firmuscare scheme and the Phoenix Supply Ltd energy care  scheme. The latter is aimed at the over-60s, the disabled and the chronically  ill.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The aim of social tariffs in the energy sector is to enable  low-income and vulnerable customers to access competitively priced energy  tariffs. Given the level of fuel poverty in Northern Ireland, I empathise and  understand that the concept of social tariffs merits further investigation as  an appropriate policy response.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The proposer of the motion talked about the need to  innovate. The concept of social tariffs has come to prominence in Great Britain,  and it has been the subject of debate there for quite some time. In GB, many  low-income customers use prepayment meters and, because they are vulnerable and  need to use that method, they pay more for their electricity and gas, which  seems perverse. That is not the case in Northern Ireland, where prepayment meters  give a 2&middot;5% reduction on the standard tariff.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Gas is the dominant form of heating for domestic customers  in GB, but, as we heard from Mr Hamilton, that is not the case in Northern Ireland.  Here, 70% of households are reliant on oil for home heating. As oil is not  subject to economic regulation, there is relatively little information  available on customer purchasing patterns in the oil industry. The Member for  East Antrim Mr Neeson mentioned that both the LPG and oil industries are not  regulated, but he will acknowledge that regulation of those industries would  add to the cost of oil and LPG, although LPG represents a small proportion of  the market. We need to recognise that adding regulation to the oil industry  will add to costs for the consumer.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">6.00 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Some information suggests that customers who can afford to  buy only a small amount of oil at a time are offered higher rates per litre  compared with those who can afford to order in bulk. That, too, concerns us,  because those in fuel poverty are being charged more for smaller amounts.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">My Department is already working with the Utility  Regulator&rsquo;s office to establish what scope exists for regulatory action to make  tariff changes for those in fuel poverty. As Mr Armstrong, and, I believe, Mr  Cree, indicated, the Utility Regulator is considering a consultant&rsquo;s report on  the potential options for progressing the development of social tariffs in the  electricity sector. The Utility Regulator&rsquo;s office issued the report as an  informal pre-consultation document to allow key stakeholders to comment,  including DSD and my own Department, with a view to understanding better the  complex issues and charting the most appropriate way forward.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Utility Regulator indicated that he hopes to release  the consultant&rsquo;s report on social tariffs by the end of November, perhaps with  initial suggestions on the way forward. The issues are complex and the theme of  social tariffs touches on wider issues of social policy as well as policy and  technical issues relating to energy markets. When the report comes out,  therefore, it will be shared with the energy industry, voluntary groups, key  energy stakeholders and all the other Departments.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">However, any move to introduce social tariffs in the energy  sector is, potentially, prone to negative knock-on effects. That fact was  acknowledged throughout the debate. As I said in my opening remarks, as economy  Minister, my priority is to promote Northern Ireland businesses and to  guard against damage to economic competitiveness and employment. Businesses  here already contribute to the Northern    Ireland sustainable energy programme through  a levy. We need to acknow&shy;ledge that. There has been much talk about profits  and companies doing nothing, but they do contribute. To expect them to  contribute again to a fuel poverty levy would further increase business energy  costs.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Many times, I have been lobbied by big businesses about  their energy costs in Northern    Ireland. The House would be sending a very  negative message if it said that big businesses needed to pay more for energy.  That would be a difficult message to send out. Indeed, perversely, it could  result in the loss of business competitiveness, and, therefore, employment,  which could bring associated increases in fuel poverty numbers. That point was  made by several DUP and UUP Members.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the debate, which was measured and informative,  and I look forward to the wind on the motion and the amendment. However, I urge  Members to bear in mind the complex nature of the issue and to take everything  into account when they vote.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  Everyone has acknowledged that there is a real fuel poverty problem in Northern Ireland.  An estimated one in three households is in fuel poverty, which is a much higher  rate than the rate in GB. That has a negative effect on not just household  incomes but on the health of those in affected households.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It has been suggested before, and again today, that a  social tariff is the solution to that problem. It was a bit of a fad and very  much in fashion about this time last year when energy companies were putting up  their prices &mdash; a bit like trainers with wheels in them or Tamagotchis, it was  the popular thing at the time. In suggesting social tariffs as a solution to  fuel poverty, however, it is worth posing and examining four broad questions.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">First, who should it help? As the proposer of the amendment  suggested, it is understandable that single pensioners, lone parents and those  on extremely low incomes could get trapped in fuel poverty. When preparing for  the debate, however, I read Northern Ireland Housing Executive figures from  October 2008 which showed that a noticeable percentage of households with an  income in excess of &pound;30,000 were in fuel poverty. Questions then have to be  asked about why and how that household is in fuel poverty.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The answer is not so much about income and more about fuel  efficiency and energy efficiency in that household. In assessing the accuracy  of need in Northern Ireland,  we must consider whether the measurement model that we use to assess fuel  poverty is correct. Moreover, we must assess the impact of the recent price  reductions on those one in three households and the impact of the &pound;150 fuel  credit that was paid last year.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The second question is: who should pay? The debate has  concentrated on that issue, and it should be foremost in our thoughts. In the  current climate, we cannot expect Government to find the estimated &pound;75 million  that was mooted by some Members. There is talk that energy companies can pay  out of their profits. Energy companies in Northern Ireland &mdash; Phoenix Gas and  NIE, in any case &mdash; are restricted to margins of around 1&middot;5%. Other Members  cited examples of energy companies in GB. However, they operate on a margin of  6%, from which they pay social tariffs. Indeed, the cost of the social tariff  was one reason that was cited recently for those energy companies&rsquo; failure to  reduce prices. It is much easier to do that with a bigger margin.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Asking energy companies here to pay out of their existing  margin has a disruptive effect on incentivising competition, which we all  support in the Northern    Ireland energy market. Therefore, the only  other option is to ask customers to pay for it. Whether some people should pay  more so that others pay less is a legitimate question. It is important to pose  that question, but it is extremely difficult to answer. Passing the cost to  business, whether big or small, will disrupt competitiveness in Northern Ireland.  Businesses in Northern    Ireland increasingly cite energy prices as a  hindrance to competitiveness; heaping more pressure on them will not be  beneficial.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">We must also ask what sort of system of social tariff we  would put in place. Would people on certain benefits enjoy the benefit of a  social tariff? When I examined the role of social housing, I visited some  houses and noticed that some of the most fuel efficient houses, through their  energy sources and insulation, are occupied by people who, I am sure, would  receive a social tariff after a benefits test. However, they live in fuel  efficient and energy efficient homes.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  No; I do not have time to give way.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Should we consider providing a social tariff on the basis  of usage? Single pensioners have low usage, and, under such conditions, second  homes and holiday homes could benefit.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">What are the other options? Are other options as effective,  if not more effective, than a social tariff? When considering increasing energy  efficiency, we should consider converting properties that use inefficient fuels  such as coal and oil to fuels such as gas. Thousands of houses in the Housing  Executive stock do not meet the decent homes standard for thermal efficiency,  and many houses that could use gas do not do so. We should consider converting  those properties.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I accept the earlier points that were made about  encouraging people to use pay-as-you-go tariffs and keypads. I agree with the  Minister for Social Develop&shy;ment; it is as much an income issue as it is one of  fuel costs.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member should bring his remarks to a close.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  We need to consider a system that benefits generators over ordinary customers.  Therefore, more money is not always the answer. As a society, we could take  measures to help fuel-poor people, other than social tariffs or giving out more  money.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Butler</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. We have had a fairly thorough  debate, in which we debated the pros and cons of the motion. I thank everybody  who spoke. Whether or not we achieve agreement on the motion is another matter.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">When my colleague Jennifer McCann brought the motion to the  House, she was aware of the concerns about who pays for social tariffs. Other  Members asked whether those costs should be passed on to other customers and  businesses. Jennifer McCann made it clear that that is not the case and that we  live in a society that has high levels of fuel poverty. Some Members, including  Sean Neeson, Leslie Cree and even David Simpson, mentioned that levels of fuel  poverty here are much higher than in Britain;  I think they are three times higher than in Britain. The intent behind the  motion was to address that issue.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  Members have talked about the definition of &ldquo;fuel poverty&rdquo; and about who can  afford to heat their homes and have electricity. Is the Member aware that the  deaths of approximately 2,000 elderly people over the past six years were  caused by cold-weather-related illnesses? People who do not have the money to  heat their homes or put on the electricity &mdash; when we talk about fuel poverty,  that is what we are talking about.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Butler</strong>: I  thank the Member for that information. It is startling that so many people in  this society are still dying as a result of fuel poverty.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Jennifer McCann mentioned a very good scheme in the South  of Ireland that has a social tariff dimension, particularly for pensioners.  They get a certain amount of free units of electricity, oil or gas to heat  their homes. It is worth noting that there are no concerns down South about  elderly people and those on low incomes getting the benefit of social tariffs.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I realise that the issue is a complex one. David Simpson  mentioned the &pound;150 one-off payment that was made last winter. That was provided  for in the Financial Assistance Act 2009. The Assembly recognises that fuel  poverty is a big issue; that one-off payment went a long way towards alleviating  difficulties for many people who were facing hikes in gas and electricity  prices.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">David Simpson also mentioned the tight profit margins on  which the energy companies operate. He asked whether social tariffs would lead  to reduced profits for those companies. However, the energy companies do have  quite high profits. Jennifer McCann said that NIE Energy made a &pound;120 million  profit.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Chairperson of the Committee for Enterprise, Trade and Investment, Alban  Maginness, spoke about the use of keypads as a form of social tariff. The  Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment said that there were concerns that  people who pay by direct debit get a 4% reduction in their electricity prices, whereas  keypad users only get a 2% or a 2&middot;5% reduction. Mr Maginness also made a fair  point about asked whether energy generators should pick up some of the costs of  having a social tariff system.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mention was made in the debate that 70% of households here  use oil, the supply of which is totally unregulated. Some Members pointed out  that the oil companies bear no responsibility whatsoever to bring in any energy  efficiency measures. In addressing fuel poverty, we must think outside the box  in determining how people on low incomes, elderly people and disabled people  can pay less for their electricity. The Minister mentioned benefit uptakes and  check-ups, and energy efficiency measures in the home, such as cavity-wall  insulation and loft insulation.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Other Members, including Billy Armstrong, mentioned the  warm homes scheme. Declan O&rsquo;Loan gave Margaret Ritchie a plug when he said that  more money has been invested in that scheme recently. Those measures can reduce  fuel poverty, but there are still pensioners and people on low incomes who will  suffer high levels of fuel poverty. As was said, it is unacceptable that  approximately 2,000 elderly people here die every year as a result of fuel  poverty.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">My colleague Claire McGill asked how the Utility Regulator  and the Minister can move the social action plan forward. The Committee for Enterprise, Trade and  Investment has also discussed that issue. The Utility Regulator is considering  the issue of social tariffs, and how NIE Energy and Phoenix Natural Gas, among  other energy providers, can help to alleviate fuel poverty and reduce the bills  that people here are paying.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">6.15 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Alex Easton said that we must be more energy efficient in  our homes. He spoke about inadequate loft insulation and about how high energy  prices impact on the most poor and vulnerable in society. That has been the  theme of the debate. Although we may not agree on how to deal with fuel  poverty, particularly among low-income families and the elderly, who are  dealing with high electricity and gas prices, we all agree that we need to make  it a priority for the Assembly to reduce gas and electricity bills.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As the Minister said, we need to examine how we can  introduce measures to help alleviate fuel poverty as part of the strategic  energy framework. The Minister will have to weigh up the social tariff and  decide whether it will form part of that framework. Her main focus in the  current economic climate is on helping businesses and driving the economy  forward.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister is concerned that businesses should not pick  up the tab for any social tariff that is introduced. It has been made clear  during the debate that the main thrust of the motion has been that neither  other customers nor the business community should have to pay for social  tariffs. Energy providers such as NIE Energy, Phoenix Natural Gas and others  have a responsibility.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I acknowledge that those companies have some social  responsibility; indeed, they have introduced some measures in past years.  Controversy surrounds the discounts offered to electricity customers who use  the keypad system, but that type of meter has been popular with many customers.  Grants have also been provided, but we say that more needs to be done, given  the high levels of fuel poverty from which this society suffers.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that I have summed up the debate on what is a very  important issue. It is complex and difficult to resolve. Whatever happens  today, I hope that the Committee for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment and its Minister, as well as the Minister for Social  Development, will revisit the issue.

      <p class="H4StageHeading">Flooding in East Belfast</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The proposer of the topic for debate will have 15 minutes in which  to speak. All other Members who wish to speak will have approximately 10  minutes.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Browne</strong>:  For the second time in slightly over two years it is necessary for an  Adjournment debate in the House to highlight the repetitive flooding in my  constituency of East Belfast.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">On 31 August 2009, homes and property in East   Belfast were once again damaged by rainfall. In contrast to  previous occasions, however, the rainfall was restricted &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. Members should either resume their seats or leave the  Chamber.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Browne</strong>:  In contrast to previous occasions, however, the rainfall was restricted to a  period of a few hours in mid-afternoon, yet it caused substantial flooding. The  relevant agencies had argued that the rainfall in July 2007 was exceptional and  they, therefore, presumed that to be the main cause of the flooding. However,  no one could reasonably argue that that was the case on 31 August 2009. Yet  again, the severe flooding in East Belfast  made the headlines in the newspapers and other media. Among the worst-hit areas  were Sydenham, Cregagh, the Woodstock    Road, Castlereagh, Belmont  and other areas in East Belfast.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">However, without repeating the well-presented arguments  that were made in the previous debate, I will highlight the main issues that  need to be addressed as a matter of extreme urgency.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There is an urgent requirement to address the need both for  a joined-up Government approach to flooding issues and for short-term  flood-protection solutions as part of an overall strategic programme.  Furthermore, there is a need to improve communications and information sharing.  That could be done through a stakeholder group, because it is essential that  stakeholders have an input to defining the problem before the Government try to  resolve it.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Each of the drainage agencies must co-operate in providing  joined-up approaches to mitigate recurrent flooding and to develop long-term  prevention measures. There is an obvious lack of joined-up thinking and working  among the drainage agencies in the areas in question. Until that is resolved  and adequate resources are devoted to such work, flooding will, unfortunately,  recur.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Of course, we know that many short-term initiatives can be  implemented. Those include installing larger street gullies, increasing the  availability of sandbags and fitting sewer line de-silting mechanisms in  alleyways that are adjacent to homes that are likely to be affected. However,  it is essential that the Departments that are involved implement, as quickly as  possible, the strategy to prevent flooding recurring in parts of East Belfast.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The EU floods directive of 2007 requires transposition into  domestic law by November 2009. I understand that the draft Water Environment  (Floods Directive) Regulations (Northern    Ireland) 2009 have been produced in order to  implement that directive. In fact, the Department of Agriculture and Rural  Development (DARD) has been appointed as the competent authority for Northern Ireland  for the implementation of that EU directive on the assessment and management of  flood risk. Therefore, I would appreciate it if the Minister would confirm  whether the Rivers Agency, on behalf of DARD, will take the lead in  implementing the directive. I would also appreciate it if the Minister would  confirm whether legislation will be in place by the appointed date.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In East Belfast, as in the rest of Northern Ireland,  the historical approach to managing storm water and foul water has been to use  a combined system that transports storm water and foul effluent to a treatment  works. However, in recent years, installing separate systems has been the  practice in new developments. Foul sewage is now collected in a dedicated sewer  and goes to a treatment works, while storm water is directed into a watercourse  in instances where little or no treatment is necessary.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Unfortunately, a large number of dual sewers are still in  operation. That is particularly the case in built-up urban areas such as East Belfast where the population has grown. Of course,  there has also been a reduction in permeable surfaces, which means that the  sewers are increasingly unable to cope with the storm water.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The situation has also been exacerbated by the legal  requirements to comply with the water framework directive and the EU floods  directive and by the intense rainfall that we have experienced over the past  number of years. Indeed, issues of climatic change need to be fed into any  assumptions that are made and into the models that are used to assess future  flood risk.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">To address those issues, and in response to commitments  that were made in the Northern Ireland sustainable development strategy to have  sustainable drainage systems, Government have developed a strategy, which is  known as SuDS, for promoting the use of sustainable drainage.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Sustainable drainage systems are hard and soft engineering  solutions that are designed to mimic closely natural catchment processes in the  management and treatment of storm water. Source-control SuDS seek to reduce  storm-water discharge from developments by dealing with the run-off close to  the source, whereas permeable-conveyance SuDS slow the velocity of the run-off,  and then reduce its volume via filtration, infiltration and evaporation.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In developing the SuDS strategy, the Government established  a working group comprised of representatives from all relevant Departments and  agencies. I would appreciate the Minister&rsquo;s updating the House on the progress  of that group. The Northern Ireland Environment Agency&rsquo;s consultation document  &lsquo;Managing Stormwater: A Strategy for Promoting the Use of Sustainable Drainage  Systems (SuDS) within Northern    Ireland&rsquo; raises interesting and challenging  issues.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">For example, it is accepted that traditional drainage  systems may be inadequate to deal with storm water in new developments, especially  with apparently more intense and increasingly frequent rainfall. However, the  real problem could be that, although individual buildings are now designed, as  I said, on a twin system, that system may merge into a single, combined system  at the main drain. The loss of permeable surfaces that can absorb rainfall is  exacerbating existing drainage problems and creating new flooding problems in  urban environments, particularly in areas where large houses are harvested and  replaced by multi-apartment buildings with car-parking spaces and little or no  gardens.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Alternative, viable options to the traditional drainage systems,  including SuDS, must be considered. However, all alternatives and additional  methods of dealing with storm-water drainage to supplement or replace existing  systems should be seriously considered. A holistic approach that involves  developers and all the relevant agencies from the earliest stage of the  planning process is also imperative to enable SuDS to be integrated into site  designs, thus maximising the flood alleviation and water pollution benefits of  SuDS.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is crucial that all Departments and all the relevant  agencies, including local government, co-ordinate and communicate before,  during and after flooding episodes. It is vital that all possible steps are  taken at the stage at which flooding might be prevented.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Although we should debate the need for joined-up Government  thinking, action and strategy to rectify flooding in East   Belfast, we should never forget the human suffering that many  constituents have had to endure over the years. I know of a 93-year-old woman  who has been greatly affected on no less than six occasions over the past four  years. That would be an extremely difficult situation for anyone, never mind a  lady of 93.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The time has long passed for talk and debate on this subject:  it is time for the Assembly to deliver so that our people will not have to  endure the hardships of flood water and sewage contamination in their homes  time and time again. It is important to remove the fear that many of my  constituents experience every time it rains. Many confine themselves to their  homes when they get adverse weather warnings because they are afraid to go  shopping; some feel that they have to return from holidays. Those people are suffering  trauma and they need reassurance. Therefore, I call on the Minister to ensure  that we are not back here in a year&rsquo;s time to debate flooding and the hardship  that it causes in East Belfast. It is time for  action.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Sir Reg Empey</strong>:  In his opening remarks, Lord Browne referred to the previous debate, so it is  d&eacute;j&agrave; vu all over again.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">On 26 June 2007, we made the same points that Lord Browne  made in his speech this afternoon. There were several factors in recent events;  over the summer, there was not just one, but a series of events. I spent  several hours out in my constituency, and it was impossible to get through on  the flood line. On ringing the traditional numbers, one was told that it was  someone else&rsquo;s responsibility. That issue has not been resolved.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">6.45 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The same places are affected again and again and again.  Maintenance, which should not be a huge logistical problem to overcome, is  still not being carried out properly. I saw blocked gratings in places that we  know are liable to flooding. Simply applying a six- or twelve-month maintenance  schedule for the hot spots may not be adequate. The local Roads Service office  knows where the hot spots are. I know that people park cars over gullies, etc,  but those problems have to be overcome.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Every time it rains heavily, people are terrified. Even  then, sandbags cannot be distributed until flooding occurs. We also asked for  local people to be provided with signs that they could put out to stop people  in 4x4s driving past and causing a backwash that brings water into their homes.  Some housing associations have experimented with putting plastic or metal  barriers over doorways and ventilators to stop water getting in.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The fact remains that the same people are suffering time  and time again. I plead with the Minister to ask the Roads Service to review  its maintenance schedules. I know that there is major expenditure in the area  on Belfast&rsquo;s  sewerage system &mdash; it is one of the biggest investments ever made &mdash; but that is  no good if street gullies are unable to accept the water. It is clear that a lot  of them are blocked. Sometimes builders are careless, and they leave sand and  cement, which is washed down drains where it solidifies. There are lots of  people who can contribute to the problem; however, the fact is that it is  happening in the same places again and again.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I refer members to the debate in June 2007. Although the  focus then was on getting cheaper block insurance for people in such  circumstances, Members made the same points. To be honest, the matter has not resolved  itself. We are told that some of the main channels require additional  maintenance and that they are silting up, but that is normal in such a system.  Upstream of all this, so much development has been allowed that the system is  inadequate; infrastructure has not kept pace with development.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">None of the infrastructure will be of value unless it is  maintained to an acceptable standard. Given that there are 10 or 11 hot spots  in the area &mdash; we all know where they are; the Roads Service knows where they are  &mdash; why is extra-special attention not given to them? Why do we have to ring up  all the time? Why is the maintenance of those hot spots not put on an  additional rota for extra-special attention? At least that would give people in  those areas some confidence that their plight is being taken seriously. At the  moment, many of them are in despair.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Deputy Speaker, you well know what it is like to have a  place flooded; it is almost worse than a fire. Everything is ruined, including  the electrics; there is the smell; sewage mixes with storm water; and the place  is in a terrible state. I appeal to the Minister to ask the Roads Service to  redouble its efforts and concentrate on the hot spots, so that those people can  be given some relief and confidence that their homes will not be flooded in the  future.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>: I  thank Lord Browne for raising this issue again, although I regret the fact that  we are having to have this debate.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Minister for meeting me on a number of  occasions to discuss the ongoing and serious problem of flooding in East Belfast, including flooding that occurred during the  past week. I apologise to him that, as a result of that, some of what he will  hear now he has heard already. I am sorry that it is repetitious, but so is the  flooding, and I will continue to repeat what I am about to say until I see a  resolution to the problem. Most of my colleagues will agree that that is  necessary.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to preface my comments with recognition that not all  the responsibility for this situation lies with the Minister who is present to  respond to the debate. Road drainage, the sewerage network and our rivers are interconnected,  and, particularly in flooding conditions, there is surcharging and flooding as  they interact with each other via combined sewer overflows (CSOs) and other  linkages. Although he is here to respond, I trust that the Minister will ensure  that his colleagues take note of what is said in the Chamber and that it is  considered and acted on.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I will deal first with the strategic issues associated with  flooding, and then I will comment on issues connected with the response,  because those are two separate areas. We all recognise that the sewerage and  drainage network, including rivers and culverts, is ageing and that its upgrade  and refurbishment has failed to keep pace with development. We must be  conscious that, in the case of rivers, upgrading is often restricted by  development. Therefore, the system is under increasing pressure, and the issue  of development is one that we must carefully consider. For example, in a  combined system, where foul and run-off rainwater are in the same pipes, the  problem is not just the number of housing units but the extent to which areas  previously available to act as soakaways are being paved. In addition, it is  not just the volume of run-off rainwater but the speed at which it reaches the  system that can lead to flooding, particularly of the flash nature that we have  experienced in East Belfast in recent years.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to highlight three measures concerning development  that must be considered in the short to medium term. First, there must be an  obligation on all developers to use sustainable urban drainage systems for any  new development, including attenuation tanks to enable the slow release of  run-off and rainwater. Rainwater recycling, which is not only environmentally sound  but will reduce the amount of run-off that is reaching the system, must also be  considered.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">For a number of reasons, the introduction of such systems  makes sense. It puts the onus on the developers to deal with the infrastructure  pressures that their development creates. Economically, that is sound judgement.  It is also environmentally sound and tackles issues around water quality, in  that it should deal with the problem of CSOs triggering very rapidly. It will  also maximise the life and capacity of the existing network and buy a little  time for the Department to invest. Building Control Northern Ireland and the  Planning Service have an important part to play in that.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The second issue that I want to raise in the context of  planning is the quality of response from Northern Ireland Water when it comes  to proposed new develop&shy;ments that are going through the planning system. When the  Planning Service refers applications to Northern Ireland Water, Roads Service  and other agencies, we must be confident that sufficient attention is being  paid to the flooding history when responses are made. I have specific examples,  as do other Members present, of situations in which there is a flooding  history, yet Northern Ireland Water raises no objections to those developments.  That is not acceptable. Furthermore, it is not simply a matter of someone&rsquo;s  looking to see whether a specific location or address has flooded. Rather, it  should involve consideration of the system downstream to see whether there is  pressure there, and then consideration of whether the new development can be  accommodated without exacerbating that problem. In responding to current and  future applications, that must be carefully considered.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Thirdly, there have been examples of where under-capacity  in a treatment works has caused the introduction of a moratorium on new  upstream developments that connect to it. I am not aware that that has ever  happened in a case in which the network is under capacity. I acknowledge that  it is much harder to identify accurately the capacity of the network because of  its complexity and the interconnections. A ban on development upstream of  flooding points is no one&rsquo;s plan A, and we would much rather see the infrastructure  improved. However, if, in the short term, we cannot get the investment to allow  the infrastructure to be brought up to suitable standards, we cannot rule out  the option of declaring certain locations completely unsuitable for development  in the short term.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I also want to talk about the definition of &ldquo;development&rdquo;.  Paving in grassed areas is currently not counted as development, so people can  pave their gardens. In a number of locations in East   Belfast, Roads Service has paved features such as grass verges. As  I said, that is not classed as development, but it should be, and to do it  should require the consent and intervention of Northern Ireland Water before it  goes ahead, because it has a direct impact on the network.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to move on to the medium to long term: the drainage  area study and the plan that will come from it. A lot of energy has been  invested in that work, and the recommendations that are developed from it will  clearly alleviate some of the issues that we are discussing today and will plan  for the future. Again, I raise my concern that the drainage network for East  Belfast is being planned in the absence of an agreed Belfast metropolitan area plan. It is  ludicrous that the infrastructure is being planned in a planning vacuum.  However, that is a longer-term issue and a resource-intensive process.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In the meantime, I would like to see the implementation of  flood alleviation schemes accelerated in areas where flooding is happening on a  repeat basis. The argument that those floods are due to exceptional weather  conditions no longer holds water &mdash; pardon the pun. Given that some locations  have flooded three or more times this summer alone, it is no longer  exceptional. Having suffered repeatedly, people are weary of the situation.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Accelerated flood alleviation schemes are crucial. In the  meantime, residents continue to live with the stress, cost and disruption of  not only the flooding itself but the threat of flooding. In those circumstances  where it is repeated, it can be either impossible or unaffordable for people to  insure against flooding; unlike in England  and Wales,  there is no public intervention on that. It also opens the Department and  Northern Ireland Water to claims for compensation where they are aware that  there is an underlying problem and have not acted to address it in a timely  fashion. I would rather see money spent on prevention than cure; I would rather  see it invested in the system.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">With that in mind, and recognising the budgetary pressures,  I will digress slightly to talk about how we spend money in relation to this. I  want to highlight the &pound;1,000 payment to assist those whose homes were flooded,  which was welcome in the context of reassurances that it was as a result of  exceptional weather conditions. However, that has now been invoked three times  in the past three years, to the tune of around &pound;3 million. That raises serious  questions about how exceptional such flooding is and whether the payment is a  good use of scarce resources.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">A number of residents in East Belfast, who have been eligible  for the payment on more than one occasion, have indicated to me that they would  rather see money invested in measures to deal with the underlying causes. To  put it in context: &pound;16,000 to &pound;20,000 could pay for storm water separation in  some localities or provide assistance for scores of people to protect their  properties against in-house flooding, both of which would address not only risk  but consequent access to insurance. That is something that needs to be looked at.  In relation to strategy, the maintenance of gullies and culvert grills needing  to be cleared is also a serious matter.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I want to look briefly at the issue of response to flooding.  I acknowledge the Executive&rsquo;s efforts to improve the response, but, despite  those efforts, it remains woefully inadequate. The creation of the single line  to report flooding was a welcome development. However, I had hoped that it  would not be a single person answering that line. I believe that at the peak of  the flooding on the bank holiday in August, there were two people answering the  phones. It was the first test of the system, and Sod&rsquo;s Law dictated that it  happened on a bank holiday weekend and without a severe weather warning.  Nevertheless, the service was abysmal. It took upwards of 25 minutes to get through  on the flood line, and people did one of two things: they gave up completely or  they circumvented the system through elected representatives using other  numbers. With the latter, we have no guarantee that those calls are being recorded  and followed up in the same way as other calls.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There was a unified number, but not a unified response.  People are still coming out on the ground telling residents that the water that  they are standing ankle-deep in is not their problem; that adds insult to  injury. We have to accept that responsibility is spread over a number of  Departments, but we should not have residents left to cope alone. We also need  co-ordination of other services. A number of Members have talked about road  closures, for example. I hope that that is something that we will see better  co-ordinated in future, as well as the follow-up and investigation.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">However, if we are to have that level of co-ordination in  strategy and response, we need the inter-agency flood working group, which was  to be convened by DARD, as the competent authority via the Rivers Agency, to  meet more regularly and to work intensively on the problem. I am disappointed  by the flood working group&rsquo;s lack of activity and progress. I believe that no  meeting was called until August or September. I hope that the Minister can  reassure us that his colleagues will be putting that at the top of their  agenda.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">It is not acceptable or sustainable that our constituents live  with the threat of flooding on a repeat basis. I hope that the Minister will be  able to offer them and us, as elected representatives, some comfort that action  will be taken to alleviate it as soon as possible.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">7.00 pm</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Newton</strong>: I  thank my party colleague Lord Browne for securing this Adjournment debate on  what is an ongoing and serious problem in the East Belfast  constituency. As Lord Browne said, this is the second time that flooding in East Belfast has been the subject of an Adjournment  debate in the House, and the matter has also been raised during Question Time,  in face-to-face meetings with Ministers and by delegations of residents and  business owners whose properties have been affected by flooding. Those who are  suffering would not forgive us if the matter were not raised again and again.  Members who have spoken in this Adjournment debate have made the point that  until the problem is sorted, our constituents will expect us to continue  raising the matter.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Finance Minister and the Environment Minister  who took time out of their busy schedules to visit residents who were affected  by the floods in the East Belfast  constituency. I pay particular thanks to the Finance Minister for making the  flood relief payment available on 31 August.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Over the past three years, we have seen East   Belfast suffer what are probably the worst floods that have been  experienced throughout the whole of the Province, and we have witnessed homes  in areas such as Cregagh, Clonduff, the Castlereagh Road, Clarawood, Hamel Drive, Ardgowan Street and  Hillsborough Drive  being flooded. The names of those areas roll off the tongues of representatives  of the East Belfast constituency, because for  the past three years, we have had regular contact with the residents of those  areas every time that heavy rain is forecast or when there is heavy rainfall.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Ian  Paisley</strong>: I live in East Belfast, and there  is great concern in the whole area about the lack of action and the lack of  change. We are talking about serious flooding. When I moved to Cyprus Avenue in East Belfast, we had a beautiful fruit garden, but that  garden has been washed away by floods, and we cannot depend on it not being  flooded. Every time that it rains, the floods come. Therefore, a large part of  my garden is absolutely useless. The rain also flows into the garden of the  property next to mine and gathers there, and, subsequently, it affects the  garden next to that. The floods are destructive, and I hope that the Minister  will see to it that we will see action and a change in this situation as  quickly as possible.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the honourable Lord Browne for bringing the subject  to the House, and I trust that the people of East Belfast  will benefit from the Adjournment debate and that action will be taken.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Newton</strong>: I  thank Dr Paisley for his intervention. The situation that he described, with  gardens being flooded, is replicated in the Finchley Park  area, where two houses flood regularly every year. In fact, when we held a  meeting with representatives of the statutory agencies in the back garden of  one of those properties, the gentleman concerned produced a file, which was  about two inches thick, on the correspondence that he has had on the flooding  issue.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I referred to the areas in which homes had been flooded,  and people in those areas are concerned. Such is their concern about the  potential of being flooded out of their homes, some folk store sandbags on  their driveways as a precaution. Having met a large number of residents from  the areas affected and representatives from the Rivers Agency, Roads Service  and the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development over the past months, I  can understand residents&rsquo; frustration. I look forward to the publication of  that report, and also to the report on the Loop,  Knock and Connswater rivers. It is important, though, that action is taken as a  result of those reports.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There appears to be some confusion as to which of the  Departments is responsible for responding to flooding in East   Belfast and for the maintenance of the rivers and the tributaries  that contribute to that flooding. Indeed, statutory officials have told me that  several very small rivers in the Clonduff area are unmapped, and although the  officials know that those rivers exist, they do not know who is responsible for  them. That lack of knowledge of who is responsible has contributed to the problems  suffered by one lady in the Clonduff area whose home has been completely  flooded four times in the past 11 years, and who is afraid to leave her house  for a weekend or for a holiday for fear that it will be flooded again. The  statutory authorities are aware of the problems, but we must reassure those residents  that we are going to take action to tackle them.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Deciding who is responsible for the problem is difficult,  but of equal difficulty is bringing about a solution. Action has been taken on  the ground, and the various agencies want and are willing to help to find a  solution to the problem. Indeed, when those agencies arrive, and see at first  hand the difficulties that householders are having, there is a willingness  among them to try to solve the problem. However, the problem can only be solved  by the Departments taking a joined-up approach, the lack of which is not unique  to this problem. Indeed, it runs through other issues and problems that are  debated regularly in the Chamber.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There is confusion in the minds of those who are affected  by the flooding, and for those who are seeking a solution to it. Those people  know that there is a need for a joined-up approach, but they do not recognise  that there is a problem between the Departments; they simply want a solution to  the sporadic flooding.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The argument for a joined-up approach has been made by  other Members. That approach was also emphasised by Belfast City Council,  which, through its flood group and health and environmental services committee,  compiled a number of proposals to deal with the flooding in East   Belfast.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The first of those proposals highlights a need to improve  communications between the various agencies and the public on what improvement  works are being undertaken or planned. Furthermore, Belfast City Council has  suggested that there is a need to develop a Government scheme to help those  householders whose insurance premiums have been increased because of the risk  of flooding. Indeed, I recently took a group of businesspeople to meet the Minister  of Agriculture and Rural Development to discuss that issue. Those people&rsquo;s  businesses had been flooded on several occasions due to an overspill of the Loop river, and, as a result, they now find it virtually  impossible to insure their businesses.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Belfast City Council also identified the need for the Housing  Executive to consider flood protection measures, and that further joined-up  working on the provision of sandbags was required. I pay tribute to the  organisers of an initiative in the Orangefield area where approximately 15  homes were completely flooded two years ago, and in addition to cleaning the  river adjacent to the houses, a large container of sandbags was placed close to  the houses and residents were given the telephone number of the person responsible  for that container. That means that, in the event of flooding reoccurring,  those sandbags can be distributed in perfect condition very quickly to allow  residents to prevent the spread of the flooding. We need to have more such  initiatives.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the fact that the Minister is in the Chamber;  that is a good sign. I hope that, as a result of this and previous debates,  some solutions will be found.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development (Mr Murphy)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann  Comhairle. I thank the proposer for securing the debate, and I welcome the  opportunity to participate in it. I also welcome the comments of the Members  who contributed to the debate.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I recognise, quite understandably, why people express frustration  at the reoccurrence of flooding in East Belfast  over a number of years. However, many responsible and helpful suggestions and  solutions have been put forward. I will ensure that a record of the debate is  distributed among the various agencies, some of which are under my authority in  the Department for Regional Development, and some, as Members have recognised,  are outside my authority. Nevertheless, I will ensure that all the agencies  have a copy of the Hansard report of the debate so that they will be aware of  the issues that were raised and the helpful and productive suggestions that  have been made. If Members have raised particular points that are not covered  in my response, I will ensure that I respond in writing.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I appreciate fully that flooding causes great distress to  people in addition to the damage it causes to homes. I also appreciate the  frustration that Members have expressed when trying to deal with those matters.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">During the latest flooding incident on 31 August 2009, the  Met Office estimated that approximately 6 mm of rain fell in approximately 20  minutes. I accept what the Member said about that not being the type of  exceptional rainfall that we had previously, and, therefore, it is all the more  disappointing that, in those circumstances, areas continue to flood. The surface  water accumulated rapidly during the middle of the day on 31 August, which  resulted in surface flooding in the Carrington    Street area and other areas of South and East Belfast. As a result, the design capacity of the  drainage network was exceeded and, in some cases, was totally overwhelmed.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The flooding that occurred on 31 August was not caused by  any failure to maintain the operational effectiveness of storm-water gullies or  the road drainage system. The road drainage infrastructure was simply overwhelmed  by the deluge of rain that fell in a relatively short time. Members will be  aware that the responsibility for the drainage infrastructure is shared between  the three main drainage organisations: the Rivers Agency, which is an agency of  the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, Roads Service, and  Northern Ireland Water (NIW).</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Procedures for liaison and co-ordination of emergency  responses between the three drainage organisations are set out in the  inter-agency flooding information pack, and that information pack is currently  being revised. I note people&rsquo;s concerns about what they considered to be the  lack of a joined-up approach.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">There is also a shared flooding hot spots list, which identifies  those areas at greatest risk of flooding and the lead organisation for each  location. Those organisations also take the lead in the development and  implementation of measures to reduce the likelihood of future flooding of those  hot spots. In addition, hot spot lists are held by each of the drainage organisations,  and they have their own programmes for dealing with those on a priority basis.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In the case of Roads Service, the problems encountered at  flood locations are not always easy to resolve, as a solution may be  prohibitively expensive or not immediately obvious. Even with the most careful  and thorough planning, gullies, road drains and watercourses can simply be  overwhelmed by a deluge of rain falling in a short time. Roads Service has  plans in place to deal with roads-related flooding incidents, which ensure that  a response is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">As far as possible, Roads Service co-operates and works  alongside NI Water, the Rivers Agency and other responding organisations,  including the PSNI, local councils, the Fire and Rescue Service and other statutory  agencies, to ensure that a quick and appropriate response is made to flooding  incidents. In its response to flooding, Roads Service seeks to restore  normality to flooded roads, having regard to the safety of the public and Roads  Service personnel, the prevention of traffic disruption and the protection of  homes and property.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">When Roads Service becomes aware of roads that have  flooded, signs are erected, where practical, to advise road users of the  possible risks. However, in the event of widespread flooding, resources will be  targeted to the busier routes that carry the greater volume of traffic.</p>
      <p class="TimePeriod">7.15 pm</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Roads Service aims to inspect and, where necessary, clean  all gullies in urban areas twice a year. That policy ensures that a reasonable  level of maintenance is carried out to drainage systems, taking account of the  Department&rsquo;s finite funding and staff resource levels. In addition to that  scheduled operation, further cleaning is carried out to deal with blocked  gullies, particularly at locations where falling leaves represent an ongoing  problem at certain times of the year, or where there has been a history of  gullies becoming blocked for other reasons.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>: I  thank the Minister for giving way on that particular point. There is an ongoing  issue, which I think was raised by Sir Reg Empey and others, of cars being  parked over gullies when the cleaning cycle is ongoing. In other countries,  residents are notified in advance of the day on which their gullies will be  cleaned, and vehicles that are blocking those gullies on those days can be  towed away. Residents are advised not to park on those roads, which are marked  on that day, so that the gullies can be cleaned. Can we not consider  introducing similar measures here to ensure that gullies are properly  maintained?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I am content for Roads Service to examine that  suggestion. The difficulty is that, although residents may be informed and may  co-operate, there may be other people either doing business or visiting a  street who may not be aware of it. I do not doubt that, if someone who was  visiting a sick or elderly relative had their car clamped or towed away, other  representatives would be saying that the Roads Service was being heavy handed.  There are always contrary arguments &mdash;</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Newton</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I will give way in a moment. It would probably be  better to ascertain the level of the problem caused by parked cars before we  introduce measures to deal with it, but I am quite happy to explore that  suggestion with Roads Service.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Newton</strong>: I  thank the Minister for giving way. He makes a valid point about visitors, and  so on, but does he not agree that it would be common sense not to create the gullies  in designated car parks so that the problem does not arise. I raise that point  because it was a contributing factor to the flooding two years ago in the  Clarawood estate, where vehicles were parked. The residents live in the high  rise flats, and the gullies were actually created in the car-parking spaces.</p>
      <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Regional Development</strong>: I will ask Roads Service to examine that particular  issue, but I accept the Member&rsquo;s point. We often inherit systems that were  built some time ago, and we try to make the best of them. I will ensure that  note is taken of that particular issue, and will come back to the Member.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Since the flooding in East Belfast  in 2008, Roads Service has carried out drainage-improvement schemes in Orangefield Lane, Merok Crescent and Tudor Drive. New  gullies have been installed at Sandhill   Park and Earlswood Road, and  a number of replacement gullies have been installed in the lower Ravenhill Road  area. In addition, further works are planned for Clonduff Drive, as has been mentioned by  some Members, and Wynchurch Road,  and investigatory work is continuing in Carnamena Avenue and Rosetta Road.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">The Rivers Agency also has a regular inspection and  maintenance programme for designated water courses in East   Belfast to ensure the free flow of water. That includes the weekly  clearance of urban grilles where blockage may cause a flood risk. The Rivers  Agency has advised that, prior to the 2007 flooding, it had already been taking  forward two flood-alleviation studies in East Belfast.  Those studies have been concluded, and it is proposed that, subject to the  availability of funding, substantial flood-alleviation works on the reaches of  the Loop, Knock and Connswater rivers will be  incorporated into the Connswater community greenway project. That multi-million  pound urban environmental project is scheduled to commence in 2010-2011, and  the flood-alleviation scheme is designed to manage the risk of flooding from  rivers, but will not address the capacity of the road-drainage and sewerage  network.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">In advance of the proposed flood-alleviation works, the  Rivers Agency has liaised with Northern Ireland Water, Roads Service and  Belfast City Council to provide mitigation where possible. NIW has advised that  its officials attended a site meeting with residents and elected  representatives of Cooneen Way  on Friday 4 September, and remedial work to reduce the risk of flooding has  since been undertaken. NIW has undertaken a major de-silting operation at Carrington Street.  Work commenced on 25 August and is expected to be completed by the end of this  month. Investigations are also ongoing into the condition of the sewerage  network in Cregagh Street,  Willowholme Drive,  Ardgowan Street  and Hillsborough Drive,  and an upgrade at Ravenhill Avenue  is being considered in order to relieve the catchment.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">NIW undertook a CCTV survey of the combined sewer in Sydenham Avenue to  check for possible blockages, and some root intrusion was found. Work to  resolve that problem has recently been completed. I understand that, during an  investigation into localised flooding problems in Hawthornden Road, NIW discovered a cable  that was partially impeding a sewer. The cable was relocated and the operation  of the sewer has returned to normal.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">All those measures are intended to prevent further  flooding, pending the outcome of the ongoing drainage area study on the East Belfast sewerage network. The study will determine  the condition of the infrastructure and identify any improvements that are  required. The study is expected to be completed by late 2009, after which a  drainage area plan, incorporating any improve&shy;ments that the study recommends,  will be developed. Completion of the plan will take a further six to nine  months, and any planned improvement works will subsequently be included in  NIW&rsquo;s capital works programme. The implementation of any proposals that are  part of the plan will, of course, be dependent on the availability of funding.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">After the flooding in August 2008, a flood improve&shy;ment  action plan was developed. That is being implemented by all three drainage  organisations for emergency planning, actual response and the clean-up and  recovery phases.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Over the past 12 months, the three drainage organisations  have put considerable time and effort into developing the flooding incident  line. The phone number was released into the public domain on 29 January 2009, and  the new service is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. I fully  appreciate that, when a person&rsquo;s house is flooded, it is important to know who  to contact and from whom to seek help. Members of the public do not now have to  decide which organisation to ring; they simply contact the flooding incident  line, where the details of the incident will be recorded and passed to the  relevant agency.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I am aware, as has been raised today, that some residents  reported difficulties with contacting the flooding incident line on 31 August.  Members will recall that Minister Wilson explained that, on 31 August, the  forecast weather conditions did not trigger a Met Office alert. However, an  incident did occur, and the flooding incident line received a surge of calls:  42 calls were received between 2.00 pm and 2.30 pm, while only three calls had  been received in the previous six hours. The number of staff was quickly  increased, but, in the initial half-hour, some of the people who called to  report incidents had to queue to have their calls answered.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Roads Service is involved in the implementation of the draft  Water Environment (Floods Directive) Regulations as a preventative strategy for  flood management. Those regulations establish a framework for managing flood  risk that is aimed at reducing the adverse consequences on health, the  environment, cultural heritage and economic activity. The regulations place an  obligation on Govern&shy;ment to identify areas of potential significant flood risk  by undertaking a preliminary flood risk assessment of all river basin and  coastal zones by December 2011.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">Flood risk management plans must be produced by December  2015. Those plans will focus on prevention, protection and preparedness, and  will detail objectives and measures to reduce the significant risk in those  areas. The Rivers Agency will take the lead in implementing the directive here.  The directive represents a shift to a more integrated, proactive and holistic  approach to reducing flood risk and places an emphasis on the use of  sustainable flood management.</p>
      <p class="B3BodyText">I assure Members that the circumstances of, and my  Department&rsquo;s response to, the flooding incident of 31 August 2009 will be  investigated to identify any opportunities to reduce the risk of further events  and to improve the standard of the inter-agency response. As with all such  incidents, it is essential that lessons be learned for the future. I thank  Members for the opportunity to speak in the debate. Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat.</p>
