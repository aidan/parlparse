                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have received notice from the Minister of
                Culture, Arts and Leisure that he wishes to make a statement on
                creating a soccer strategy for Northern Ireland.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure (Mr
                McGimpsey):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With World Cup football euphoria all around
                us, it is perhaps timely that I bring the subject of football in
                Northern Ireland to the Assembly for debate. Regrettably,
                Northern Ireland has not been participating in the World Cup
                finals in Korea and Japan, but I hope that we shall qualify in
                future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members may recall that last May I introduced
                the future of football for debate in the Assembly. I had
                initiated a process of developing a football strategy for
                Northern Ireland in October 2000. Activities involved in that
                initiative included establishing an advisory panel, which was
                chaired by Billy Hamilton; a widespread research exercise, which
                included public meetings; a conference workshop in February
                2001, which involved representatives of key stakeholder groups;
                and action planning to consider recommendations for the way
                forward.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Last year’s debate allowed me to elaborate
                on those activities and to provide an interim report on progress
                by the advisory panel in considering the issues that emerged.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Later, in October 2001, the advisory panel
                presented me with its final report, which contained more than
                150 recommendations for developing the sport. I published the
                report for consultation, and Members were sent copies. The
                official closing date for comments was the end of January 2002.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My purpose in bringing this subject to the
                Assembly is to update Members on the current position; to advise
                Members on the result of consultation on the advisory panel’s
                report; to give my assessment of what must happen to overcome
                the problems facing football; and to put the game in Northern
                Ireland on a sounder footing for the future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to convey my sincere appreciation to
                the organisations and individuals, which include some Assembly
                representatives, that have shown a keen interest throughout the
                process and have forwarded their views on the recommendations to
                my Department.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Before I move on to a more detailed
                discussion of the recommendations, I wish to explain why I have
                devoted particular attention to football. I have been asked,
                &quot;Why football?&quot;. Northern Ireland seems to have an
                innate ability to produce great football players such as Danny
                Blanchflower and, of course, George Best, who received one of
                the highest accolades in football when he was named European
                Footballer of the Year in 1968.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are the smallest country ever to have
                played in the World Cup finals on three occasions. We reached
                the quarter-finals in 1958 and 1982, and the first round in
                1986. Norman Whiteside, at 17 years of age, was the youngest
                player ever to have played in the World Cup finals. That is a
                proud history, and it is an inspiration for the future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Around 26,000 people play football in
                Northern Ireland: people of all ages and of all levels of
                talent. Those are official figures, but they do not take account
                of recreational play in the local leisure centre or the number
                of children who knock a ball about in the school playground, the
                local pitch or on the street. Those numbers must run into many
                thousands.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must not forget the managers, referees,
                coaches, spectators and administrators who support the game in
                other ways. Figures show that there are 1,700 qualified coaches
                and 400 officials, including referees. Vast numbers of
                volunteers and parents give endless time and commitment to the
                game, week in and week out.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Football has one of the highest levels of
                participation of any sport in Northern Ireland. Furthermore, it
                is an interface game that crosses our society’s divisions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, it is a sport in serious
                difficulties, especially at senior level. It faces many
                problems, including sub-standard grounds, low match attendances,
                unruly crowd behaviour and financial problems.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the Minister responsible for sport, I
                considered it my responsibility to do something to resolve the
                difficulties facing one of our most popular sports, and that is
                why I initiated a process to study all aspects of the game.
                However, that has not been to the exclusion of other sports, and
                I am prepared to continue to consider proposals for the
                betterment of sport and our society in general.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall summarise the main recommendations of
                the advisory panel’s report. The panel felt that the bodies on
                governance and administration were not as effective as they
                should be and that they should take steps to change the
                arrangements, preferably by creating a new governing body, which
                would combine the functions of the Irish Football Association (IFA)
                and the Irish Football League. The Irish League should be
                reorganised into three divisions and should form the top of a
                pyramid that provides an open, inclusive and progressive league
                structure from the grass roots to the top.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clubs should take steps to improve how they
                manage their affairs and should place emphasis on developing
                community-based activities. An agreed, coherent youth
                development policy should be established to provide a strong
                foundation for the future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The governing body’s successful football
                programme for children and adults with learning disabilities
                should be broadened to include people with physical disabilities
                and sensory impairment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The development of girls’ and women’s
                football should become a mainstream activity of the governing
                body, as should the management and co-ordination of refereeing.
                Each of those areas should have dedicated development officers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Northern Ireland players’ football
                association should be established, and supporters should form a
                football supporters’ association.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Building on work to date, the governing body
                should lead on the development of a strategy to tackle
                sectarianism and to improve community relations, and steps
                should be taken to improve media relations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Government should introduce new
                legislation for Northern Ireland to ensure safety at sports
                grounds and to control spectator behaviour. The legislation
                should be accompanied by a funding package to improve grounds
                and safety management. An assessment should be undertaken to map
                out present playing facilities and to assess future
                requirements.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A national stadium that provides a neutral
                and welcoming environment, and that meets international
                standards for football should be established. Last, but by no
                means least, the advisory panel emphasised the importance of
                treating, and taking forward, its recommendations as an
                integrated package.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We consulted widely on the advisory panel’s
                report. The vast majority of those who commented during the
                consultation period endorsed the recommendations. Having
                considered the panel’s report and the comments received, I
                shall give the Assembly my assessment of what needs to happen in
                football.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The core issue to emerge from the process,
                and the most sensitive one to resolve, was that relating to the
                governance and administration of football in Northern Ireland.
                The responses to the advisory panel’s report indicate broad
                support for the line taken by the panel, especially for the key
                recommendation for a single, newly constituted governing body
                that combines the current functions of the IFA and the Irish
                Football League. I recognise that both organisations are long
                established and have served the community well over many years
                — the IFA since 1880 and the Irish Football League since 1890.
                They deserve much credit for that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In more recent times, however, the wider
                football community has shown an apparent lack of confidence in
                the present arrangements, as evidenced by research and
                widespread consultation. We are living in changed times,
                especially in Northern Ireland, and I support the view that
                arrangements and practices for managing football must be adapted
                to meet modern-day needs and standards, and to meet present and
                future challenges for the game.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Both organisations recognise and accept the
                need to change. A group of representatives from the two bodies
                has been working for some months, with the support of a
                facilitator engaged by my Department, to consider proposals.
                That is significant, and I warmly welcome the efforts that they
                have been making.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A widely accepted football administration
                should be put in place, founded on the principles of equality,
                fairness, inclusiveness, leadership, accountability and
                transparency. I attach significant importance to those
                principles, as does the Assembly. An acceptable administration
                in charge of the management of the game is key to making
                progress across all other issues.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to see an organisation that provides
                effective leadership and clear strategic direction to the game;
                that is fully acceptable and accountable to all levels of the
                sport; that is properly and fairly representative of all levels
                of the sport, with full integration of all levels into policy
                making and programme activities; that is innovative and
                imaginative in promoting and delivering the game across all
                areas of activity such as the disabled, women’s and girls’
                soccer, community relations, supporters and refereeing; that
                owns and is capable of delivering a plan to put football back
                where it belongs, as a dynamic and growing sport for everyone;
                and that is transparent and open to scrutiny, both at governance
                and day-to-day administrative levels.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The IFA and Irish Football League
                representatives have been considering proposals for change for
                around six months. It is imperative that those organisations
                urgently and comprehensively bring their deliberation on the
                issue to a conclusion and give a clear commitment to implement
                changes generally consistent with the advisory panel’s
                recommendations. I have already met their group of
                representatives, and they are fully aware of my position.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to make it abundantly clear that I
                consider that the effective management and administration of
                football is fundamental to making progress on all other fronts.
                Without a commitment to change, I am unable to envisage how we
                can move forward on all the other issues. As I mentioned in my
                summary of the advisory panel’s findings, the panel’s view
                was that all its recommendations must be considered as an
                integrated package, and I agree with that view.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An area of concern that emerged from
                consultation on the advisory panel’s report was that it was
                perceived by some to place too much emphasis on senior clubs
                without sufficiently addressing the needs of junior or
                intermediate football, or recognising the voluntary
                contributions devoted by many people week after week.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no doubt that acute problems exist
                at senior club level. I have already mentioned some of them, and
                Members will be familiar with the issues. Improvements in the
                senior game will have a positive impact on all other levels,
                from grass roots to international. It is a poignant reminder
                that Northern Ireland has not qualified for a World Cup
                tournament since 1986. It would be nice to think that that could
                be turned around over the next decade. That is achievable if we
                provide a pathway up from the grass-roots level for the most
                talented players.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">10.45 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the soccer strategy is not all about
                providing for the most talented players. It is about providing
                the best possible opportunity for the community to have access
                to and to participate in the game at all levels — playing,
                refereeing, watching, making a voluntary contribution, et
                cetera. At the outset of the initiative, I made it clear that
                there would be a collective process to understand and address
                the problems facing the game. The recommendations produced by
                the panel address more than senior football, and an important
                one is that there should be a pyramid system enabling
                progression from the grass roots to senior football. That has my
                support, but junior and intermediate clubs should want to aspire
                to the standards of senior clubs. Is that happening now?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other recommendations that would have an
                impact on the non-senior game relate to youth development, women’s
                and girls’ football, refereeing, playing facilities and the
                governance and administration of the game. I expect any
                long-term development plan for football to address all levels of
                the game, and I do not envisage any additional resources being
                for senior football only. They would also have to provide for
                development outside the senior game, and location must also be
                taken into account to ensure opportunities for widespread access
                and participation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The advisory panel’s view is that we should
                have a national stadium to meet international standards for
                football and that such a stadium must have a neutral and
                welcoming environment for everyone. I concur. However, the
                priority is to get the football structure right to ensure that
                football’s potential as a participation and spectator sport is
                realised before we engage in such a capital undertaking.
                Therefore, my first concern is to ensure a sound basis for the
                sport in Northern Ireland rather than prestigious projects. We
                need a football ground of international standard, and that is
                why the governing body must produce detailed options for meeting
                that need.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The football authorities must settle the
                long-term structure of the Irish League without delay. I have
                already said that I support a pyramid structure with the Irish
                League at the top. The structure must be clearly defined, with
                clearly established criteria for promotion and relegation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Football clubs, especially the senior ones,
                must manage their affairs more effectively and efficiently, and
                there should be training to help them. The key to the future of
                all clubs, regardless of the level that they play at, is
                community involvement. That should be the priority for clubs.
                There is much scope for them to bond better with their
                communities and to establish themselves as active and vibrant
                hubs of activity through linking up and working with local clubs
                and teams. Those should include women’s and girls’ teams;
                youth clubs; primary, secondary and special schools; disabled
                groups; ethnic minority groups; community groups; supporters;
                and participants in other sports. Clubs must be imaginative and
                proactive in establishing those links — the bigger clubs or
                consortia could play a leading role in developing community
                involvement, and I am prepared to look at ways of helping
                football further down that route.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I endorse the widespread view that youth
                development in football is a crucial building block for the
                future of the game. That is why I have already invested initial
                funding in that. Urgent steps are needed to establish a common
                youth development policy, based on the advisory panel’s
                recommendations, which has the agreement and commitment of all
                interested groups, including the Northern Ireland Women’s
                Football Association, the Northern Ireland Boys’ Football
                Association and the Northern Ireland Schools’ Football
                Association, among others. Northern Ireland should have a youth
                academy, and that should be developed as part of the Sports
                Institute Northern Ireland (SINI).</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Northern Ireland should have similar
                legislation to the mainland that makes provision for improved
                safety at major sports grounds and for controlling spectator
                behaviour. I am willing to introduce proposals for such
                legislation that would be applicable to football, rugby and
                Gaelic grounds. New safety legislation would have significant
                implications for many sports grounds in that improvement work
                would need to be carried out in order to comply with the new
                safety requirements. That would require major investment, and an
                assessment has identified that expenditure in the region of £30
                million would be necessary over eight to 10 years. Any funding
                support to clubs for improved facilities and safety management
                should be tied into conditions relating to wider measures for
                improving the game, such as youth development, community
                development, the development of women’s and girls’ sides of
                the sport, et cetera. Clubs would be expected to make a
                financial contribution to ground improvements.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Adequate playing facilities are essential,
                especially for the football grass roots, to meet the needs of
                the hundreds of teams and players that turn out each week. We
                need to examine the implications of introducing a pyramid system
                whereby clubs that aim to progress would have to fulfil certain
                criteria on standards. The introduction of mini soccer for
                primary school-age children would have implications for
                facilities for clubs, district councils and, in particular,
                schools. Special requirements for women and girls would have to
                be allowed for. The Sports Council for Northern Ireland should
                be asked to lead, in consultation with key users and providers,
                in mapping out existing provision, assessing future needs and
                examining ways of meeting those needs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I fully agree with the advisory panel’s
                recommendations on the future development for disability, women’s
                football and refereeing. I fully acknowledge the excellent and
                positive work carried out by the IFA, but there is scope for the
                governing body to play a more active and leading role in those
                areas. The governing body and other providers should be mindful
                of the need to promote equality of opportunity for all. That
                includes the need to take account of ethnic minorities, and
                possibly other groups, in our society. I have already referred
                to the scope for clubs to engage with ethnic minority groups to
                establish greater links with their communities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sport is a vehicle for building better
                community relations. Football, as an interface sport, is
                particularly suitable, and I support the advisory panel’s
                recommendations on this subject.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Local football recognises the need for a
                positive image for the game. The IFA and the Irish League have
                taken positive steps towards implementing the panel’s
                recommendations for improving media relations. I especially
                welcome the Irish League’s work on producing a communications
                code of practice.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Last year, I informed the Assembly that steps
                were being taken by football players to re-establish the Players’
                Football Association. However, I understand that the
                organisation has not materialised in spite of initial
                enthusiasm. That is disappointing, but perhaps players will
                revisit the idea at some time in the future when there is an
                improved football environment overall.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not aware of any steps by football
                supporters to form an umbrella body in Northern Ireland similar
                to the Football Supporters’ Association in England. Again,
                that is a matter for the supporters themselves to address, but I
                noted with interest the advisory panel’s comments that the
                Football Supporters’ Association has become an effective and
                respected lobby group that is consulted regularly on a range of
                issues. Perhaps that is a step further down the line.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sunday football has proved to be an emotive
                issue, and it has attracted many letters from members of the
                public who strongly object to the idea. I fully understand and
                respect that view. In comparison, the majority of the responses
                received from those who have a more direct interest in football
                agreed that the rules should be changed to provide the option to
                play on a Sunday, and I fully appreciate that also. The key to
                this is choice. Both views are valid and sincerely held. It is
                not for me to impose a solution. It must be decided at
                individual and community levels, and that is a matter for the
                football organisations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How should we move forward from here? I have
                explained the rationale behind my initiative to develop a
                football strategy. However, it is important to remember that
                sports governing bodies are, in general, voluntary organisations
                established to co-ordinate, control and develop all aspects of a
                particular sport. I recognise and respect that position and, in
                the case of football, I have striven to work and co-operate with
                the IFA to encourage change.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have outlined the bones of the way ahead
                for football, and we now need to put flesh on those bones in the
                form of a detailed development plan. In recognition of the role
                of the governing body, it is primarily a matter for the IFA to
                take the lead in drawing up a development plan, in close
                association with the Sports Council and in consultation with
                other relevant parties.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr J Wilson] in the
                Chair)</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is essential that the long-term
                development plan include the following: the fundamental
                principles of equality, fairness, inclusiveness, accountability,
                leadership and transparency — to which I attach significant
                importance; clear objectives, actions and targets, and
                demonstrations of how they are linked to the advisory panel’s
                recommendations; resource requirements linked to a time frame;
                and a clear case supporting the need for such resources, citing
                the additional benefits that they would bring for football and
                for the wider community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The development plan should demonstrate how
                assistance for football would help the Government meet their
                wider aims and objectives. Through the strategy process we have
                assembled substantial information, recommendations and views to
                enable work on such a plan to begin. I am prepared to present a
                paper to the Northern Ireland Executive seeking the necessary
                resources to support action to restore the game of football to
                its position as a successful sport that serves both communities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, as Colleagues will be aware, there
                can be no guarantee that additional resources from the public
                purse will be forthcoming, given the fact that resources are
                scarce and that there is pressure from other sports and sectors
                under my responsibility, let alone from other Departments. The
                case for football must, therefore, be comprehensive and robust.
                If I am to bid for resources, I need a development plan to be
                presented to me urgently. There must be an immediate indication
                from the IFA that it agrees to move forward on that basis.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">From 2000 to 2002, my Department made
                available £2·5 million, which, together with funding from the
                National Lottery and the Football Foundation, has enabled the
                Sports Council to assist a programme of safety improvement works
                at major sports grounds. By that, I mean football, Gaelic and
                rugby grounds. Under that scheme, football has benefited to date
                to the tune of £1·96 million, of which £1·58 million has
                gone directly towards improvement works at 21 grounds.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Last December, I announced that there would
                be further funding of £1 million to support the continuation of
                that programme in 2002-03, and I expect that football will
                continue to be a major beneficiary. That is the first
                significant funding made available for safety work at sports
                grounds in Northern Ireland, and it was possible only as a
                direct consequence of a devolved Government with a Minister
                responsible for local sports matters. As commendable and welcome
                as that has been, considerably more funding is required if we
                are to bring major sports grounds up to acceptable standards for
                players and spectators. As I have said, some £30 million would
                be required, and it is estimated that a significant portion of
                that would be required for football grounds.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.00 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was also pleased to announce last December
                that I would make £1·6 million available over three years
                until 2003-04 to address some of the matters that were
                identified in the advisory panel’s report. That money is being
                invested in youth development — specifically, in the programme
                for football development centres. Each of those will deliver
                three key strands of youth development: mini soccer targeted at
                primary school children at Key Stage 2; community football for
                12- to 16-year-olds that involves innovative community-based
                activities to broaden interest in the game; and centres of
                excellence that will provide elite coaching for the most
                talented players in those age groups. Opportunities at those
                centres must be open to both boys and girls and to persons with
                a disability.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Applications from clubs, or from a
                combination of clubs, for assistance under the programme were
                invited by public advertisement on 17 and 18 June. Awards will
                be determined on the basis of the ability of clubs, or a
                combination of clubs, to meet the necessary criteria. I look
                forward to seeing the first of these football development
                centres being established over the next few months. The
                Department will, of course, monitor their effectiveness and
                success.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have already been successful in providing
                much needed finance to improve football. However, extra funding
                for safety improvements runs out in March 2003, and that for the
                youth development programme runs out in March 2004. Clearly, if
                all the advisory panel’s recommendations are to be accepted
                and taken forward in their entirety, considerably more
                investment will be required. By initiating the strategy and by
                having already brought substantial funding to the table, I
                believe that I have demonstrated good faith in the game of
                football and a commitment to helping it out of its difficulties.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Obviously, much more must be done to improve
                football in Northern Ireland. A huge amount of time and effort
                has already been devoted to bringing the process to this stage.
                I am satisfied that the recommendations in the advisory panel’s
                report, taken in their totality, have the support of wider
                football interests and provide a sound basis for developing the
                game. The report must now be translated into an agreed
                development plan for action, and I look to the governing body to
                produce that, with support from the Sports Council.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If I am to lodge a package of costed
                proposals with the Executive, which, I emphasise, must be done
                in 2002, the leadership of football must live up to its
                responsibilities to the football community and provide a clear,
                unambiguous commitment to sign up to a package of measures that
                are consistent with the recommendations in the advisory panel’s
                report. In particular, it must agree to implement changes in the
                structure of governance and administration of football, and lead
                in drawing together a long-term plan for the future of football
                in Northern Ireland. Without such a commitment I have no basis
                on which to continue to make a special case for football.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Committee for Culture,
                Arts and Leisure (Mr ONeill):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I commend the Minister on his full and frank
                statement on the advisory panel’s report on the future of
                soccer. Like the Minister, the Committee strongly supports the
                advisory panel’s recommendations. It also agrees that they
                should be developed as a complete package. However, public
                funding for sport, as for everything else, is limited. There are
                many calls on scarce resources.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister said that soccer has done
                exceptionally well compared to other sports in the past few
                years. Those who are involved in other sports might justifiably
                ask why the leadership of football has been so slow to respond
                to the interest shown in its difficulties, why it has apparently
                failed to acknowledge the effort that has been invested in
                drawing up the recommendations for its future and why it seems
                not to have recognised that the public funding that it has
                received to date begs some response. When the Minister talks
                about an immediate response, does he mean that a timetable has
                been set for that response? Has the Minister set a deadline, and
                if not, why not?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Through you, Mr Deputy Speaker, I apologise
                to the Minister, as I will be unable to stay for the rest of the
                comments. I have another appointment.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGimpsey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not in the business of setting
                deadlines. The Assembly, the Executive and I are here to support
                football and the bodies concerned with developing the game. We
                want to create a successful and vibrant sport that will enable
                us to compete at the highest level on the one hand, and, on the
                other hand, to ensure participation and access at all levels.
                Football has had support, but much more needs to be done.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Hamilton Report was published on 30
                October 2001. The IFA and the Irish Football League have had
                almost nine months to respond to it. People are asking why those
                bodies have not responded by now. Nine months is sufficient time
                to respond. To mitigate that criticism somewhat, the Department
                of Culture, Arts and Leisure is facilitating a process between
                the IFA and the Irish Football League to arrive at an agreed
                position to allow them to move forward. That process has been
                ongoing for some months.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not impose deadlines, but the process
                itself, almost by definition, imposes its own. Football is, to
                an extent, running out of time as regards the Hamilton Report.
                The footballing bodies would be doing a great disservice to the
                football family and themselves if they did not respond
                positively and urgently to that report.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Davis:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I declare an interest, as I am a member of a
                football club that has just gained promotion. I congratulate the
                Minister on his statement and on establishing the advisory
                panel, which was representative of all football interests. We
                must recognise the panel’s commitment to the soccer strategy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several important matters and recommendations
                were noted in the report. I agree especially with the Minister
                that there has to be effective management and administration of
                the game in Northern Ireland. Indeed, those involved in
                administrating football here must make a genuine commitment to
                change. The nettle must be grasped to stop the sport from
                continuing to wither.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Any recommendations for the good of the game
                must be implemented as quickly as possible, as football is under
                tremendous pressure. Everyone involved in football at all levels
                in the Province is to be congratulated for his contribution to
                the sport over many years. However, I am sure that the Minister
                will agree that something must be done as quickly as possible.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGimpsey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wholly concur with Mr Davis’s remarks. It
                is nine months since the publication of the Hamilton Report.
                That should have been adequate time in which to make a
                definitive response. Work is ongoing in the background between
                the two governing bodies, the IFA and the Irish Football League.
                However, there is dissatisfaction in the football family that
                things have not moved faster. It seems that football is facing
                severe challenges.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Northern Ireland last competed at the highest
                level in 1986, and participation at that level is the
                manifestation of a healthy game. If we want that high-level
                standard to be reached, we need to consider the grass roots.
                Football is the people’s game. It must be accessible, and
                participated in, by the people. Improving standards from the
                youth level upwards is the way to reach the highest level.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is much to be done. The Hamilton
                Report, with its 150 recommendations, is football’s voice, not
                mine. That view of football is the product of 12 months’
                exhaustive work by the panel. It listened carefully to the views
                of the football family, and its recommendations and views are
                the voice of the constituency and must be paramount.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hilditch:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I declare an interest. It is unfortunate that
                we are limited to questions on the Minister’s statement and
                cannot debate it. I welcome broadly the statement and look
                forward to the implementation of the recommendations,
                particularly the football development centres, which, it is
                hoped, will be up and running by August 2002.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Where does the blame for the disappointment
                lie? At various levels of administration there is a hunger to
                progress, but there is a blockage in the system. Perhaps the
                Minister could specify where the blockage occurs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is the Minister aware that, at its meeting on
                Thursday 27 June, the Irish Football League management committee
                will examine next year’s league structures? Has any guidance
                been given on that, through consultation with that committee,
                given that leagues of 12 teams and eight teams present problems?
                The premier league would be lucky to complete the season.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a result of the advisory panel’s report,
                people became involved to save local clubs, some of which were
                hundreds of thousands of pounds in debt. Is it likely that a
                stupid and rash decision by the Irish Football League management
                committee would cut those clubs adrift and remove their senior
                status, given that they are perhaps less than halfway through a
                five-year business plan?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGimpsey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Mr Hilditch for his constant interest
                and his broad welcome. The implementation plan is not a matter
                for me but for the IFA, the governing body of football. We seek
                the IFA’s agreement to embrace the recommendations and to
                produce a plan to demonstrate how those will be implemented.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is not helpful to apportion blame at this
                time. The Hamilton Report contained many changes and
                recommendations. They will take time to assimilate, but a
                facilitation process is under way.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hilditch mentioned the football community’s
                disappointment, and I share some of his frustration. Hamilton
                recommended a pyramid of three leagues, each with 14 teams.
                Again, that is a matter for the Irish Football League. It is not
                for me to impose the number of leagues or the number of teams in
                them. However, we look to the Irish Football League to reflect
                the Hamilton recommendations, which were taken as a package.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No guidance was given by my Department, other
                than the support given to football. That has been achieved by
                creating a strategy for football in accordance with the Hamilton
                Report. It is a matter for the Irish Football League; however,
                bearing in mind that the recommendations resulted from
                consultation with the football constituency as a whole, it would
                be a mistake not to consider them seriously.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I too declare an interest. I am a member of
                Linfield Football Club and hold a season ticket. I take
                particular interest in the future of Windsor Park.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister referred to proposals for a
                national stadium. However, Members have been told that resources
                are scarce for all Irish League grounds, not just Windsor Park.
                Would the scarce resources not be better spent on bringing
                Windsor Park up to international standard and improving other
                Irish League grounds? Does the Minister, in his reference to
                neutrality at the stadium, mean that the Union flag would not
                fly and the national anthem would not be sung at international
                matches?</p>
                <i>

                </i><b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGimpsey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have attempted to make clear my position on
                having a national stadium at several Question Times, but I will
                do so again for the benefit of Mr Boyd, who may have missed my
                answers. Apart from land and running costs, more than £60
                million is needed to build a national stadium to international
                standard. If I had £60 million, I would not spend it on such a
                prestigious capital project; I would spend it on developing the
                game. There are tangible examples of such development, which
                include the allocation of £1·6 million to the youth
                development programme. Money should be spent on raising the
                standard of the game. Most people in football aspire to a
                prestigious national stadium, but such a project is feasible
                only at a particular time, and now is not that time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Boyd referred to the scarcity of
                resources. I compete with other Ministers for scarce resources,
                so the chance of winning more than £60 million to build a
                football ground is remote. Moreover, football has more
                fundamental needs than a prestigious new stadium, though that
                may come in time. Windsor Park and other football grounds need
                capital expenditure, as do Gaelic and rugby grounds, for which
                there are investment plans. The Department’s health and safety
                scheme will continue to benefit those sports.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Boyd questioned my reference to the
                neutrality of the national stadium. I will not define what is
                meant by that; Mr Boyd can do that for himself. A national
                stadium should be a place where everyone feels comfortable and
                welcome. Questions have been asked about the neutrality of
                Windsor Park. The authorities there take that seriously, and I
                look forward to hearing their proposals.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Windsor Park does not meet international
                standards, and if we want future international games there,
                money must be found and practical help given to enable the Irish
                Football Association to improve the ground to the minimum
                standard.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report comes at an appropriate time, and
                I welcome it. I am in favour of community and voluntary
                involvement, of which the Foyle Cup in the north-west is a good
                example. It is imperative that areas that have been neglected be
                high on the agenda. Omagh Town is the only Irish League team
                west of the Bann. Although my home town has several excellent
                football teams, it has never had senior representation in either
                the B division league or the Premier League. I welcome the
                commitment to community involvement and, especially, the safety
                legislation. Will the Minister ensure that areas such as
                Strabane are given top priority?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGimpsey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Mr McMenamin for his broad support.
                There are ways to deal with areas of neglect. For example, the
                Executive and the Programme for Government have several
                overarching principles, especially for targeting social need,
                rural proofing and so forth, and those should help. I am talking
                primarily about football. As for the progress of Mr McMenamin’s
                local club, one of the key recommendations was a pyramid league
                system that would allow teams to progress upwards if their
                standards and skills matched.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I have already said, community involvement
                is the key to that. There is a huge constituency for football;
                nearly everybody has played football at one time or another,
                whether recreationally, formally at school or on other teams.
                Who can forget the night when Northern Ireland beat Spain in
                1982? We remember those highlights. There is a strong
                groundswell of support for football. However, football does not
                connect at every level of the community, so its future must be
                based on building those connections. Some clubs are making
                efforts on that front, but others must work harder. Football
                clubs collectively, like all of us, must work harder. Community
                involvement is needed to improve standards at every level of the
                game.</p>

                ‘Strategy for the Development of Sport in Northern Ireland
                1997-2005’, written by President Mary McAleese, among others,
                when she was a professor at the Queen’s University of Belfast?</p>

                strategy and our progress with it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Sports Council is responsible for
                developing sport in Northern Ireland and is the prime funding
                body through which the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure
                directs it resources. Its policy, business plan and objectives
                have been agreed, and they fit in well with the objectives of
                the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure, the Executive and
                the Assembly. The Sports Council will be reviewed soon, and that
                will be informed by developments since that strategy was
                published. I was unaware that Mary McAleese was involved with
                the Sports Council in those days; there is no limit to some
                people’s talents.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Sports Council’s budget was cut last
                year from £2·8 million to £2·3 million. Its budget is
                decreasing, and so is participation in sport in Northern
                Ireland. There is a direct relationship between the two. The
                latest survey by Queen’s University demonstrates that those
                with an active lifestyle cost the Health Service 30% less than
                inactive people do. Therefore, if we want to save money in the
                Health Service in the long term we must involve people in an
                active, healthy lifestyle. The prime body for involving people
                in those activities is the Sports Council.</p>

                I also welcome broadly the report. I am happy that the Minister
                mentioned players such as Danny Blanchflower and George Best,
                but I remind him that today in Magherafelt a plaque is being
                unveiled to a man who may be among the greats of Irish football:
                Peter Doherty. He is also worthy of mention, as are Jackie
                Vernon or Mickey Hamill, for example. Jackie Vernon was probably
                one of the best centre backs who ever played for Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If there is to be a soccer strategy, what
                about strategies for hockey, cricket, rugby and boxing? Will
                those sectors feel marginalised because of the concentration on
                soccer?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first team to beat England on English
                soil was an all-Ireland soccer team that won 2-1 at Goodison
                Park in 1948. The English made the excuse that, because the
                match was not played at Wembley, it did not count. We had to
                wait until Hungary beat England 6-3 before it counted.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Soccer is an interface sport with an unhappy
                history. Malcolm Brodie said recently that there was no future
                for a Northern Ireland soccer team in international football.
                Will the Minister examine the possibility of creating an
                all-Ireland soccer team, just as there are all-Ireland rugby,
                hockey and boxing teams?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Windsor Park was mentioned as a possible
                venue for a national stadium, but it would not qualify as a
                neutral or welcome environment. Given that so many sports are
                played on an all-Ireland basis, might there not be some merit in
                discussing with Bertie Ahern the idea of a superbowl rather than
                a &quot;Bertie Bowl&quot; or even a &quot;McGimpsey Bowl&quot;?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I referred to Danny Blanchflower and George
                Best. George is far and away our most famous footballer and is
                arguably, as Pelé has said, the greatest footballer ever. John
                Kelly mentioned Peter Doherty and Mickey Hamill, and he
                reiterated my point that we have a wide range of players, past
                and present. The Northern Ireland manager, Sammy McIlroy, played
                for Northern Ireland in the World Cup tournaments in Spain and
                Mexico. People sometimes forget that the manager of Celtic,
                Martin O’Neill, was a hugely successful player who has a
                couple of European Cup medals to his credit. We have a proud
                football heritage.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to other sports feeling
                marginalised because a soccer strategy is being adopted, the
                fact is that football is the people’s game, and it is an
                interface game. It is played by all sections of the community.
                As far as good governance is concerned, there is no
                contradiction in helping footballers and supporting football.
                Representatives for hockey and other sports have never
                complained of being marginalised.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">John Kelly mentioned the 1948 all-Ireland
                soccer team, and the idea for another such team has been mooted.
                I have not read Malcolm Brodie’s comment that Northern Ireland
                soccer has no future; however, during the 1958, 1982 and 1986
                World Cup competitions, Northern Ireland was the smallest
                country ever to compete. We have a proud list of players who,
                over the years, have played key roles in the game at local,
                national and international level.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The IFA is football’s governing body in
                Northern Ireland, and it is the fourth-oldest governing body in
                the world. It was established when football was an all-Ireland
                sport and there was one national team — Ireland. In 1921, the
                Irish Free State broke away from the United Kingdom, and
                Republicans forced partition on Ireland and refused to play
                all-Ireland football. The Irish Free State insisted on setting
                up its own association, the Football Association of Ireland (FAI).
                For many years, Northern Ireland continued to play under the
                name &quot;Ireland&quot;, and the Ireland team was Northern
                Ireland until the mid-1950s. After repeated complaints from the
                Southern authorities, it was agreed that the name
                &quot;Ireland&quot; would be dropped, and the teams started to
                call themselves &quot;Northern Ireland&quot; and the
                &quot;Republic of Ireland&quot;.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As regards the future, no one seems to be
                pushing for an all-Ireland team in a constructive way. My role
                as Minister with responsibility for sport is to support Sammy
                McIlroy and the Northern Ireland team. That is the team that I
                cheer for and that I went to see regularly at Windsor Park. I
                assure the Member that the crowds who went to see the team play
                in 1982 and 1986 were by no means drawn from one section of the
                community.</p>

                it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, we are talking about getting the
                community to go to football matches and encouraging families to
                attend. There is nothing in the report that deals with the
                reasons why people stay away from football matches. The Minister
                must be living with his head in the sand. Although improvements
                have been made, not nearly enough has been done to address the
                sectarianism and tribalism that keeps people away. The Minister
                seems to dodge the question every time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Was consideration given to introducing
                legislation similar to the Football (Offences) Act 1991 to
                Northern Ireland? Does the Minister recognise that sectarian,
                racist and tribal chanting continues to be a serious problem on
                Northern Ireland’s football terraces? If so, what plans does

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCarthy:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What consideration has the Minister given to
                introducing legislation similar to that across the water? He
                mentioned in his statement that he wishes to introduce safety
                legislation to Northern Ireland. I contend that sectarian
                chanting at football matches is keeping the community away from
                the grounds.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGimpsey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am at a loss at Mr McCarthy’s paradoxical
                position. He first congratulated and supported me; then he told
                me that I live with my head in the sand.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to barriers to attendance, the
                Member must consider the overall interest in football here. For
                example, if the Member were to attend the Milk Cup in Coleraine
                in July, he would see a packed ground. He would see not only
                fathers, but whole families. He would see mums with their
                daughters, their sons and their husbands. Watching the Milk Cup
                at Coleraine Showgrounds is a nice way to spend a summer’s
                evening in the sun. The Milk Cup is an example of a local
                football tournament that has grown into an international event,
                attracting teams from all over the world.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sadly, sectarianism is a product of Northern
                Ireland society. We all deplore it, and we do what we can to
                eradicate it. However, we cannot expect football alone to solve
                our society’s problems. Society must solve its problems and
                not pass the buck to football.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall legislate as necessary. I am prepared
                to consider legislation, and I have made that commitment
                repeatedly in response to questions on the issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Legislation will require a resource
                commitment. We must have some responsibility for legislating,
                and, consequently, we must have some responsibility for those
                resources as well.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Football is an interface sport; it is our
                only major sport that is genuinely so. An interface sport is one
                that is played by all sections of our community. That is why it
                is so important and why we are making such efforts to give
                football the support that the Hamilton recommendations call for.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Shannon:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister’s recommendations,
                but I am disappointed that the IFA seems to have failed to grasp
                the need for change at its level. Football is the national sport
                of Northern Ireland, and it brings together all sections of the
                community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was at both the Spain 1982 and Mexico 1986
                World Cups. In those days I was not married; I could go wherever
                I wanted, but it is slightly different now. Moreover, the team
                qualified then, which was the reason for going. Those were heady
                days for Northern Ireland, and the team played exceptionally
                well — they played the shirts off their backs. Is it a
                coincidence that our football’s downward trend seemed to start
                when the league developed another layer of administration? The
                IFA may have produced legislators, but countries such as
                Senegal, Turkey, South Korea, Japan and the USA, who are
                participating in the World Cup, have all produced footballers
                and teams capable of going to the World Cup finals. The focus
                must be on the pitch, not on the office.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What steps is the Minister taking to ensure
                that top officials, instead of striding the world football stage
                in their best — and well-travelled — suits are working to
                lift football at all levels? The heady days of 1982 and 1986 can
                and will return. Many are pursuing changes at all levels, and
                the IFA must get its hands dirty as well. It must make changes
                from the bottom up and from the top down. What assistance will
                be available for junior clubs that aspire to do better, and to
                lift themselves from the junior level and upgrade their grounds?
                Examples of those clubs are Killyleagh YC, Comber Rec and Ards
                Rangers — those are three local teams that are striving to do
                better.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What can the Minister tell us about Friday
                matches? I understand that the decision will not be left to the
                home team, but must be with the agreement of both teams.
                Changing matches to Friday may be advantageous to football in
                the Province. Thank you very much, Mr Deputy Speaker, for your
                graciousness.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGimpsey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I cannot comment on a coincidence between
                league officials’ actions and a downward trend in football.
                There clearly is a downward trend that we must reverse. That is
                the reason for the strategy and for the Hamilton Report. The
                strategy, supported by the Assembly, is my proposal. We wish the
                football authorities to adopt the Hamilton recommendations, both
                to show that they are prepared to make the necessary changes and
                to give us an implementation plan that we can all get behind.
                That is the strategy. It is for the governing bodies of football
                to make those decisions — it is not for me to impose them. If
                they make those changes I can argue in their favour. It is
                difficult for me to argue for resources for them without such
                commitment. Those are not my changes or Billy Hamilton’s
                recommendations; those are the recommendations of the entire
                football family, which have been dealt with by the Hamilton
                panel.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One proposal is for a pyramid structure that
                would allow junior clubs to develop; the Member is correct in
                referring to Senegal and others. A key issue about which I have
                spoken is that community involvement and youth development
                should be from the ground up. That is why we have found funding
                for youth development, and one way of encouraging youth
                development is through the clubs. Any of the senior and
                intermediate clubs, or a consortium of clubs, can avail
                themselves of grant aid. They can employ a youth development
                officer to develop the youth in their area, using the three
                strands: mini soccer; community football for 12- to
                16-year-olds; and coaching for talented players.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Hamilton panel approves the support of
                elite athletes in football. A key mechanism for doing that will
                be Sports Institute Northern Ireland, which is part of the
                UK-wide Sports Institute network. That is going ahead at
                Jordanstown. I hope that athletes will attend the institute this
                October. Thus far, rugby, athletics, hockey and Gaelic bodies
                have signed up, and each sport will have a performance director.
                To date, football has not availed itself of that opportunity. I
                implore the IFA to take that opportunity. We shall not only
                provide football with a performance director, it will also be
                able to obtain the support of the infrastructure that will be
                available in Jordanstown. Support services relating to strength,
                stamina, sport and medicine, which are common to all athletes,
                will be provided. That is another tangible measure that the IFA
                can take. Football was not included in tranche one. Tranche two
                is now available, and two more sports will be admitted.
                Competition is strong, but I implore the IFA to get involved
                because it is one of the key ways to take the game forward.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Soccer is a game that all can play without
                any hindrance, and that is very worthwhile. The debate is
                appropriate in these World Cup days. Reference has been made to
                players such as George Best, Peter Doherty, Danny Blanchflower
                and Jackie Vernon. Windsor Park has also been referred to.
                Although the Minister mentioned the establishment of a new
                national stadium, what will happen to Windsor Park? That ground
                has served the country very well for a long time. Sadly,
                although people talk about Windsor Park, not many people go
                there now. I remember standing in Windsor Park when there were
                about 48,000 people at international matches.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Reference was also made to an all-Ireland
                team. People from across the island played together in the days
                that I have just mentioned, and we were often beaten by England
                and Scotland by six or seven goals to one. Will the Minister
                think again about making improvements to Windsor Park?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister also said that junior football

                been proud that the Irish Junior Cup final has been won for the
                past three years by Fermanagh teams — Irvinestown Wanderers,
                Lisnaskea Rovers and the north Fermanagh club, Kesh.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is not a question of whether I shall think
                again about Windsor Park.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have already outlined what I see as the
                proper and sensible way forward. I do not see us having the
                funding for a major prestigious capital project such as a new
                international stadium. If we did have the amount of money
                required, I am not sure that that would be the best way to use
                it.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Football needs to be developed at the grass
                roots — at community and youth level. As far as the Northern
                Ireland international team is concerned, Windsor Park needs some
                investment to raise it to an acceptable international standard.
                The IFA must come and tell me what it sees as the way forward
                and what its options are. It should not wait for me to make
                suggestions or impose a course of action. I shall not be
                imposing anything. It is for the IFA to come forward with its
                proposals to ensure that it has a ground of acceptable
                international standards for the international team to play on.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to the junior clubs, I have said
                that we need to move forward at all levels. The strategy is not
                simply about the senior game; it is about the game at every
                level, and junior clubs play a vital role.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Campbell:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall stick rigidly to your request to ask
                questions, Mr Deputy Speaker.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome sections of the report and the
                reference that the Minister made to the 26,000 individuals who
                play football. That shows the level of interest in the national
                game. In his earlier comments, he said that he considered that
                any funding support to clubs for improved facilities and safety
                management should be tied into conditions relating to wider
                measures, such as youth development, community involvement, the
                development of the women’s and girls’ side of the sport, et
                cetera. Does the Minister believe that a good way to implement
                and promote that would be to fund clubs that already carry out
                those functions and that already provide those facilities? That
                would provide a twofold impetus. It would support the clubs that
                are already doing so, and it would provide an impetus for other
                clubs that are not doing so to get involved in community
                development and women’s and girls’ sport. Many clubs in the
                north-west are already doing that, as are the organisers of the
                Milk Cup — a competition that was mentioned by the Minister.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGimpsey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not broadly disagree with the sentiments
                expressed by Mr Campbell. Some clubs are doing extremely
                important work and taking their game forward. We look to support
                those clubs. Some other clubs are lagging behind, and certain
                areas of the game need development and support. We need to look
                at how we can support those clubs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We shall not turn our backs on health and
                safety. We shall ensure that spectators are safe when they go to
                the grounds, that objects will not fall on them and that they
                will not trip over objects. Health and safety is a key
                requirement for all citizens, and they are entitled to that kind
                of support from the Government. A raft of measures is involved,
                and we shall try to give levels of support to those measures.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need to see something in return as well.
                We are involved in a programme, a policy and a process that
                cannot be a one-way street. I want the soccer governing body to
                say that it supports the recommendations, and I want to see its
                implementation plan. I shall then look at resource implications
                and make the arguments for them at that point.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Byrne:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I too welcome the Minister’s efforts to try
                to tackle the sorry state of soccer in Northern Ireland. How
                committed are the football authorities to developing a
                meaningful, sincere and practical approach to the development of
                youth football? I would suggest that the lack of youth football
                competitions is probably one of the main reasons why the game is
                in such a sorry state. I ask the Minister in his deliberations
                with the football authorities to impress on them their
                obligation to try to help and promote youth football.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There were two other famous football players
                who were not mentioned: Norman Whiteside, who was a great
                product of a youth policy in Belfast, and Pat Jennings, who was
                perhaps the greatest goalkeeper ever.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGimpsey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I did mention Norman Whiteside, who, at 17
                years of age, was the youngest player from any country to play
                in the World Cup finals. I agree that Pat Jennings was one of
                the greatest goalkeepers ever. As far as the young are
                concerned, we have committed £1·6 million to youth
                development, and we are looking at three areas of need: mini
                soccer, elite coaching and community football for 12- to
                16-year-olds. That will reinforce what is already going on. Some
                senior clubs are doing important work in developing youth
                football. We wish to reinforce that to support them and to make
                it available to clubs at all levels, not just at senior level.</p>

              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The main purpose of the Strategic Planning Bill
              is to amend the Planning (Northern Ireland) Order 1991 and to
              assist the Department of the Environment and the Department for
              Social Development in carrying out their statutory functions in
              respect of implementing the regional development strategy.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Members will be aware, strategic planning is
              my Department’s responsibility, while operational planning,
              including the preparation of development plans and policy, are the
              responsibility of the Department of the Environment. The Bill
              deals with the relationship between the regional development
              strategy, which was agreed by the Assembly on 17 September 2001,
              and development plans.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Before dealing with its main provisions, I
              shall briefly explain the need for the Bill. The Strategic
              Planning (Northern Ireland) Order 1999 provided the legal context
              for the preparation of the regional development strategy. It also
              amended the Planning (Northern Ireland) Order 1991 by introducing
              an obligation to ensure that future planning policies, development
              plans and development schemes are &quot;consistent with&quot; the
              strategy. Several concerns were expressed about the
              &quot;consistent with&quot; requirement before the formulation of
              the regional development strategy.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, there was a concern about three
              development plans being introduced by the Department of the
              Environment that were well in advance of the regional development
              strategy. The Bill deals with that difficulty by way of a
              transitional arrangement for those three plans.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, the Department of the Environment
              expressed concern that the requirement could produce a potential
              conflict of tension in respect of its duty to secure the orderly
              development of land, an obligation placed on it by the Planning
              (Northern Ireland) Order 1991, and the requirement to ensure
              consistency with the regional development strategy.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thirdly, there was a concern that the
              requirement might adversely affect the Department of the
              Environment’s ability to respond to changing circumstances
              unforeseen in the regional development strategy. Legal opinion was
              sought on those concerns about the &quot;consistent with&quot;
              requirement, and on receipt of advice from senior counsel it was
              agreed that the alternative wording &quot;in general conformity
              with&quot; provided the flexibility sought by the Department of
              the Environment while maintaining the clear authority of the
              regional development strategy.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The relatively short Bill is in three parts and
              has three main clauses. The first clause amends the requirement
              that development plans must be &quot;consistent with&quot; the
              regional development strategy to one of being &quot;in general
              conformity with&quot;. I have agreed with the Minister of the
              Environment that the concerns raised by his Department can be
              averted by that change in wording.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second clause makes provision for a
              statement of conformity procedure in the statutory planning
              process. I regard that as a very important provision in the Bill.
              It will reaffirm the primacy of the regional development strategy
              since all future development plans must be &quot;in general
              conformity with&quot; it. The importance of the overarching
              authority of the strategy was raised by the Committee for Regional
              Development on several occasions. It was concerned that the
              regional development strategy should have teeth for the
              development plan process. The new statement of conformity
              procedure will provide a robust policing role to enable the
              Department for Regional Development to assess whether a
              development plan is in general conformity with the strategy.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I see the statement procedure as part of four
              stages of plan preparation. The first stage is before the
              publication of the draft plan, when the Department for Regional
              Development will be required to issue a first statement that
              offers its opinion on the conformity or otherwise of the draft
              plan. By working closely with the Department of the Environment,
              officials from the Department for Regional Development will do
              everything possible to ensure that plans do conform with the
              regional development strategy. However, if the Department for
              Regional Development is of the opinion that a draft plan does not
              conform, a statement of non-conformity will be issued that will
              specify how the draft plan is not in general conformity with the
              regional development strategy.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A statement of non-conformity will be treated
              as an objection to the draft plan. It is not in anyone’s
              interest that that should happen, and officials will work closely
              with the Department of the Environment as plans are prepared to
              avoid such an event.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second stage is the issue of a report by
              the Planning Appeals Commission after a public inquiry into the
              draft plan. The issue of conformity will be considered at the
              public inquiry. The subsequent Planning Appeals Commission report
              will deal with any objections that may alter the relationship
              between the plan and the regional development strategy.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The third stage will come when a draft adoption
              statement is prepared by the Department of the Environment. In
              preparing that draft statement, the Department of the Environment
              must take account of the Planning Appeals Commission’s report,
              which will include recommendations made in the light of all
              submissions at the inquiry, including those on the conformity of
              plans with the regional development strategy. At that stage, the
              Department for Regional Development will be required to issue a
              second statement on the conformity of the plan, and the Department
              of the Environment will have to regard that second statement
              before it adopts the plan.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fourth stage in the process will be the
              published Department of the Environment adoption statement.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The adoption statement will refer to the
              contents of the second statement on conformity, and it will
              confirm that the Department of the Environment has taken it into
              account before adopting the plan. I have outlined the crucial
              double-locking nature of the statement-of-conformity procedure.
              The procedure meets the concerns of the Committee for Regional
              Development, and I am satisfied that the regional development
              strategy has teeth.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.00</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clause 3 makes provision for transitional
              arrangements for three development plans — the Cookstown area
              plan 2010, the Craigavon area plan 2010 and the Dungannon and
              South Tyrone area plan 2010. The provision addresses difficulties
              that arise because the preparation of those plans commenced
              several years before the regional development strategy was
              formulated. In accordance with normal planning practice, it was
              not desirable to freeze the preparation of those plans until the
              strategy was in place. Therefore, the Bill provides for an
              exemption for the three plans from the proposed requirement that
              development plans must be in general conformity with the regional
              development strategy.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Under clause 3(3)(a), the plans will be
              exempted from the requirement that any policy prepared under
              article 3(1A) of the Planning (Northern Ireland) Order 1991 should
              be in general conformity with the strategy. Also under clause
              3(3)(b), the Department of the Environment will be exempted from
              the requirement under article&nbsp;5 of the Strategic Planning
              (Northern Ireland) Order 1999 to have regard to the regional
              development strategy in respect of those plans.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In simple terms, the three plans, as adopted,
              will not be required to undergo the &quot;in general conformity
              with&quot;, or the &quot;have regard to&quot;, test in respect of
              the regional development strategy. Also in respect of the three
              plans, the Department of the Environment will not be required to
              pass either test in respect of policy formulation. However, any
              subsequent change to the plans will mean that they are caught by
              the test.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The provisions under clauses 1 to 3 of the Bill
              are the only means for dealing with issues that have emerged
              regarding the relationship between the regional development
              strategy and development plans.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill will have no additional cost
              implications for Departments, other bodies or individuals. It is
              likely that any work arising from these provisions can be handled
              using existing resources. The Bill is — as Members may have
              judged from my remarks — largely technical, and its provisions
              have not proved controversial.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Earlier this year the Department for Regional
              Development carried out a full public consultation exercise
              involving more than 400 organisations, interest groups and
              individuals. Only 31 responses were received, mainly from district
              councils, public bodies and Departments. Only one response —
              from the Planning Appeals Commission — raised a substantive
              issue. It concerned a point of fairness about the second statement
              of conformity in the context of the public inquiry procedure.
              Independent legal experts advised that there was no inherent
              unfairness in the provisions. I am satisfied that the Bill, as
              drafted, is clear and will not give rise to difficulties.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I appreciate the constructive role that the
              Committee for Regional Development played in the formulation,
              pre-introduction consultation and later work on the Bill. I ask
              the Assembly to support the Bill.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Committee for Regional
              Development (Mr A Maginness):</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for acknowledging the work
              of the Committee and for his usual co-operation with it. I thank
              also the departmental officials who attended Committee meetings to
              brief members on the purpose and details of the Strategic Planning
              Bill.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee spent much time examining the
              regional development strategy in detail. Every member recognised
              the importance of the strategy given that it establishes an
              important strategic planning framework for Northern Ireland for
              the next 25 years. Therefore, the Committee was determined to
              ensure that the strategy was balanced, challenging and, above all,
              deliverable. Given the expected impact of the regional development
              strategy on society over the next 25 years, the Committee paid
              particular and close attention to the pre-introduction
              consultation on the Strategic Planning Bill. As the Minister said,
              the Bill is largely technical, and its provisions have not proved
              to be controversial. Nonetheless, it is a critical and significant
              piece of legislation that will help to ensure the successful
              implementation of the regional development strategy.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the Committee first examined the proposals
              in the Bill, it was apprehensive about the change of words from
              &quot;to be consistent with&quot; to &quot;in general conformity
              with&quot;. There was concern that Departments might pay only lip
              service to the overarching authority of the regional development
              strategy. In the words of the Minister, the Committee was
              determined that the strategy should &quot;have teeth&quot;.
              However, departmental officials and the Minister have explained
              the Bill’s main provisions. As the Minister said, the Bill will
              reaffirm the primacy and the authority of the regional development
              strategy and will contain the requirement for all future planning
              policies, development plans and development schemes to be in
              general conformity with the strategy. That has helped to reassure
              the Committee that the Bill will have teeth and will be an
              effective tool to ensure the successful implementation of the
              strategy.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee is reassured by the provision in
              the Bill for a new statement of conformity in the statutory
              planning process. That is important, and the Minister has
              explained in detail how the statement of conformity procedure will
              operate. The procedure should provide the Department for Regional
              Development with the robust policing role required to assess
              whether a development plan is in general conformity with the
              regional development strategy.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In conclusion, the Committee looks forward to
              considering the legislation and examining its clauses in detail.
              It is committed to conducting a detailed scrutiny and intends to
              consult widely and take evidence from interested parties.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Robinson:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Chairperson of the Committee for
              Regional Development for his constructive contribution. I welcome
              the Committee’s support and thank it for its role during this
              process.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The legislation will clarify and formalise the
              important relationship between the regional development strategy
              and the development plans. The Committee rightly pointed out the
              importance of the strategy as an overarching strategic framework
              within which development plans and policies must operate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I note the general welcome for the change from
              &quot;consistent with&quot; to &quot;in general conformity
              with&quot;. However, I note the Chairperson’s initial
              reservations on this, and I am persuaded, as are he and his
              Committee, that the approach will operate satisfactorily and
              ensure that the authority of the regional development strategy is
              not diminished.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have been heartened by the expression of a
              view that was broadly endorsed by councils during the public
              consultation. Although councils recognise the importance of a
              regional strategy, many welcome the flexibility offered by the
              proposed change in the wording. Indeed, many have recognised the
              need to ensure the primacy of the regional development strategy.
              On the basis of independent legal advice, I am satisfied that the
              changed wording will not impugn the authority and the
              authoritative nature of the strategy. The primacy point is
              particularly important in relation to the new provisions to
              introduce statements of conformity before the publication and
              adoption of a draft plan. I am pleased that that provision was
              welcomed; it will provide a double-locking mechanism to maintain
              coherence and conformity with the regional development strategy.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clearly — and I say this in the presence of
              the Minister of the Environment — it is not in anyone’s
              interest that the Department for Regional Development should be
              seen to object to a development plan by the Department of the
              Environment. In my opening remarks, which, I think, were made
              before the Minister arrived in the Chamber, I stressed the
              importance of my Department’s working closely with Department of
              the Environment officials to bring forward development plans that
              conform. My officials will draw up with the Department of the
              Environment a protocol for preparing development plans and setting
              the key milestones — not millstones — at which discussions
              will occur to ensure that they meet the key objectives of the
              regional development strategy. In short, the statement provision,
              coupled with the protocol, will go a long way to ensure that
              development plans are in conformity with the strategy.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some people have raised concerns about the
              derogations provided for the three development plans. Having
              spoken to some of the representatives from the councils concerned,
              I believe that there is a general welcome in those areas for the
              provisions of the Bill. Concerns had been expressed that the plans
              would be receiving a &quot;get-out-of-jail&quot; card for the
              foreseeable future. Of course, nothing could be further from the
              truth. The derogation applies to only those three plans as
              adopted. The decision taken on the derogation was a pragmatic one.
              Each of the plans commenced considerably in advance of the
              regional development strategy, and it was only fair and reasonable
              that they could not have been expected to anticipate the final
              content of the strategy. Commitments and planning permissions that
              had been given during the course of their preparation meant that
              in some respects, most notably in relation to housing capacities,
              they were not aligned with the regional development strategy.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I must emphasise again that in many respects
              those plans reflect the key themes and objectives of the regional
              development strategy. They each contain a sustainable framework
              that sets an important policy context, against which local
              development proposals will be assessed. As I have already said,
              the derogation given is in respect only of the three plans as
              adopted. Any alteration or replacement to a plan will switch the
              lights back on, and the entire plan will have to pass the test of
              being in general conformity with the regional development
              strategy.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the supportive comments made by the
              Chairperson of the Committee for Regional Development. I ask the
              House to support the Second Stage of the Bill.</p>

              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Marriage Bill is intended to simplify,
              consolidate and, perhaps most importantly, bring a level of
              equality to the existing procedures in relation to the formalities
              and preliminaries that must be undertaken in order for a marriage
              to take place. Members will note from the outset that the Bill
              does not deal with, nor is it intended to deal with, the concept
              of marriage — the voluntary union of a man and a woman, to the
              exclusion of all others. The Bill aims to provide a universal
              system that applies to all persons who wish to marry, while
              recognising and supporting the practices and principles that exist
              for those of different religions. It does so by implementing the
              vast majority of the recommendations that were submitted to the
              Government by the respected law reform body, the Law Reform
              Advisory Committee for Northern Ireland. I thank the advisory
              committee for its invaluable work, especially the chairman, the
              Hon Mr Justice Girvan, who devoted much of his own time to the
              production of the report.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.15 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members may be aware, whether from personal
              experience or knowledge of the existing system, that current
              marriage laws are based on a model set up in Victorian times. The
              premier statute is the Marriages (Ireland) Act 1844. Since then,
              the law has developed in a piecemeal fashion. There are more than
              20 pieces of legislation on the statute book that a reader must
              refer to in order to gain a full knowledge of the current legal
              framework. The Bill aims to streamline and consolidate that and
              provide a much easier reference point for those wishing to know
              the legal requirements that they must follow before a marriage
              ceremony can take place.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The current law is not applied uniformly.
              Privileges in relation to the celebration, timing and venue of
              marriages are granted to certain religious groups, but not to
              others. The position on venues for religious and civil marriages
              is unnecessarily complex and unsatisfactory. Rules regarding
              notice of marriage and preliminary notification requirements are
              considered to be too complex. Rules relating to the registration
              of marriages require some streamlining.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is in that context that the Bill comes
              before the Assembly for consideration. The advisory committee
              consulted closely and widely with all religious organisations and
              those in secular society, and it concluded that the existing
              system required wholesale change. The advisory committee noted
              that certain matters were operating well, therefore no changes are
              being made to matters such as the capability of parties to
              contract to a marriage or to the rules regarding age, kinship and
              affinity.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill gives effect to the advisory committee’s
              recommendations and focuses on the principle of equality. It
              removes the existing legal differences between religions and is
              modelled on the Scottish system, which has worked effectively for
              the past 25 years. The system of marriage preliminaries is
              restructured, with the removal of archaic concepts, and provides a
              greater freedom of choice to couples wishing to marry. Removing
              unnecessary obstacles to marriage and making it more attractive to
              individuals will perhaps provide a further step in strengthening
              the commitment to stable family life.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill contains several main features. In
              relation to religious marriages, there is a change of emphasis
              from the registration of buildings to the registration of the
              person performing the ceremony, known in the Bill as the &quot;officiant&quot;.
              In other words, the relevant priest, minister, clergyman, pastor,
              registering officer or other officiant will now be registered
              under the new legislation. That will allow different religions to
              submit a list to their registrar general of those members able to
              celebrate a marriage. Therefore, it will be a matter for those
              Churches, as opposed to state-imposed requirements, as to where a
              wedding ceremony can take place. It will provide a greater variety
              of choice for couples wishing to engage in a religious marriage,
              but it will not impinge on the right of the Churches to regulate
              where and when marriages can take place.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Similarly, the law in relation to civil
              marriages is also being reformed. At present, couples can have a
              civil ceremony only at the local register office, which may not be
              the most attractive venue for a wedding. The Bill outlines a new
              statutory scheme in respect of venues for civil marriages. In
              essence, responsibility will be given to locally elected councils
              who, under guidance from the Registrar General, will be able to
              license alternative, and perhaps more attractive, marriage venues.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The system of preliminaries is to be made
              universally applicable. All couples wishing to marry will be
              required to obtain a marriage schedule that will contain all the
              relevant details. The requirement to live in the district in which
              the wedding is to take place can cause an artificial, and
              potentially annoying, inconvenience for some couples. Such archaic
              concepts will no longer apply. The current system, which is based
              around banns, licences and certificates, will be replaced by one
              system that applies equally to all, irrespective of religion or
              belief.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Changes to religious and civil marriages will
              appeal to more couples and may well persuade many people,
              particularly those who no longer live in Northern Ireland or who
              perhaps have historical connections to it, to come here to marry
              at a location of their choice. That, in turn, could result in a
              welcome boost for the tourist industry, as has been the experience
              in Scotland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill consolidates other issues and provides
              for general supplementary matters such as searches and
              registration districts. It also takes account of ancillary
              criminal offences.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A two-tier consultation process preceded the
              advisory committee’s report. The range of opinions received
              showed that there was widespread support for the reforms contained
              in the Bill. In addition, my officials carried out a follow-up
              consultation exercise last year that concentrated on the equality
              impact of the changes and allowed people a final opportunity to
              comment on the policy. Again, support for the advisory committee’s
              recommendations was almost universal.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill will not come into effect immediately:
              it is the first stage of a process that will ultimately set up a
              new framework for marriage. Once the Regulations supplementing the
              Bill are in place, I shall take the steps necessary to bring the
              legislation into force. I expect that the scheme will be up and
              running at some time in 2003.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is the general thrust of the Bill. It is
              probably human nature; but when speaking about marriage law,
              initial thoughts turn to issues such as the solemnity of marriage
              and related matters. I remind Members that the changes contained
              in the Bill will be made in the context of several key principles.
              The validity and solemnity of religious marriage is not in
              question. Interference with the existing freedoms of individual
              religions will be minimal. There will be equality of treatment for
              all religions and between people who wish to have a civil or
              religious marriage.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, the Bill contains the aims of
              simplicity, transparency, ease of application and
              cost-effectiveness. This is an important area of law reform with a
              significant social impact. Marriage is not an institution to be
              entered into lightly, nor should the marriage ceremony be treated
              with anything other than solemnity and dignity. However, as we
              move forward into the twenty-first century, some of the aims and
              objectives of the existing system must be addressed, as must the
              level of state interference in the preliminaries to marriage.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill will help to make the institution of
              marriage an attractive prospect for all people. In addition, it
              will promote Northern Ireland as a venue in which couples can get
              married, which can only be beneficial to our economy in the longer
              term, while recognising and upholding the basic tenets of
              marriage. Accordingly, I am happy to commend the Bill to the
              Assembly.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.
              Given that marriage is a holy and permanent commitment, the Bill
              will be relevant for some time, but Members should note that the
              Minister intends to introduce a divorce Bill, which brings into
              doubt the permanence of marriage. However, the Marriage Bill
              provides for the different situations of people.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee for Finance and Personnel found
              that the willingness of the Minister and the Office of Law Reform
              to facilitate its pre-introductory scrutiny of the Bill was
              important. It sets a precedent, which shows that Committees can
              become involved in discussions before Bills are introduced, and it
              gives Committees the opportunity to influence Bills and to deal
              with small issues at the outset. I welcome that development, and
              it is to be hoped that all Ministers will adopt that practice.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Office of Law Reform is conducting an
              ongoing review of civil law, because developments in civil law
              here lag behind those in England, Scotland and Wales. The Marriage
              Bill has its foundation in the recommendations of the Law Reform
              Advisory Committee. In its report ‘Marriage Law’, the
              committee noted that it was especially impressed by the
              arrangements that have operated effectively in Scotland since the
              Marriage (Scotland) Act 1977. As the Minister stated, the Marriage
              Bill is similar to that Act, and it incorporates many recent
              developments in Scotland, which are based on English law, that
              abolish rules relating to venues for religious and civil marriage.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee wanted to ensure that
              consultation on the Bill’s proposals would be extensive, and
              departmental officials have assured members that it will be. The
              Committee recognises that responses to the consultation exercise
              have indicated widespread support for the modification of, and the
              proposed changes in, the law. Marriage law must be reformed to
              establish consistent good practice across the procedural and legal
              requirements for the formalities of the marriage ceremony, whether
              in church or in a special venue chosen by the couple. The Bill
              does not address same-sex marriages, and it contains little that
              could be considered controversial.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill acknowledged the principle of equality
              and will be welcomed by many, young and old, who do not attend
              church but would prefer something other than a short ceremony in a
              registry office. The Bill offers people a choice of venues. It is
              to be hoped that local councils will use imagination to make
              ceremonies more appropriate and welcoming to couples and their
              families. The Committee hopes that the improved provisions will
              cover a broad band and bring joy to many couples on the happiest
              day of their lives.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee will consider the Bill in detail
              and scrutinise its provisions carefully.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Lewsley:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members must acknowledge the needs and wishes
              of people who choose to marry. Many people do not wish to take the
              traditional approach. Marriage is a life-changing decision, and
              values and beliefs have changed considerably since previous
              marriage law was introduced. People must have a choice; therefore,
              I welcome the Second Stage of the Marriage Bill. I commend the
              Minister for bringing Northern Ireland’s marriage laws into the
              twenty-first century. The Minister said that current marriage law
              dates back to the Marriage (Ireland) Act 1844. Although it has
              served us well in the past, its time is surely up. Will the
              Minister tell the House why this is a suitable time to amend the
              legislation?</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.30 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also welcome the fact that the Bill
              streamlines marriage procedures and removes much of the complexity
              associated with planning a wedding, especially in regard to venues
              and officiants, while offering greater equality. The current trend
              is for people to celebrate their union in less formal settings,
              and we should facilitate that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister has already mentioned the boost to
              the tourist industry in Scotland, and I am sure that in future we
              will get many requests for new venues at which weddings can be
              performed. For example, people could choose our own tourist
              destinations, such as the Giant’s Causeway or the Carrick-a-Rede
              rope bridge, or perhaps even scuba diving in Lough Neagh. Who
              knows?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many people who take their vows take marriage
              seriously, and their celebrations would be improved if they had
              the opportunity to choose a different venue. I support the motion.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr Ian Paisley:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Bill. As the first Protestant
              Member to speak on the Bill, I think that there is agreement about
              it. There is no doubt that the present law discriminates against
              many people. For instance, it discriminates on time: if you are of
              a certain religion, you can marry only between certain hours on
              certain days, but if you do not happen to be of that religion, you
              cannot marry on certain days or at certain hours. If people belong
              to a particular church they can have a special licence to marry in
              their own home, whereas others who do not belong to a church or
              religious group that is permitted a special licence cannot have
              any such privilege.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The financial and explanatory memorandum
              suitably describes the basis of the Bill:</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The current law stems from a series of
              statutes dating back to the early Victorian era. The system of
              marriage preliminaries has not developed on a uniform basis and
              privileges in relation to the celebration, timing and place of
              actual marriage are granted to certain religious groups and not to
              others. The current rules relating to religious and civil marriage
              venues are unnecessarily complex and unsatisfactory, and certain
              churches are afforded greater autonomy than others that are
              subject to a larger amount of state control.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those laws were discriminatory, and I am glad
              that they will be abolished.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I should like to associate myself with what the
              Minister said about the advisory committee. That committee did a
              very good job, and it started from the basis that discrimination
              would cease and that everybody would stand on a common platform.
              The real basis of the change relates to places of worship. In the
              old days the venue was registered and licensed for marriage, but
              the Bill will license the minister or the officiant. I have
              studied the law in Scotland, because I have relationships with
              churches in Scotland, and I have found that that law is good. It
              is simple compared to our current Regulations.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One has only to look at marriage law to see the
              number of new churches that were not given a special provision to
              facilitate their people to marry outside their own place of
              worship. All those matters are taken care of in the Bill, which I
              welcome. The majority of people in Northern Ireland, regardless of
              their religious convictions, or even if they have no such
              convictions, will welcome the Bill, because it puts everyone on a
              common platform, and it will certainly benefit people.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are different marriage areas in Belfast;
              for instance, a person can get married in Castlereagh only if he
              lives there. People must claim that they live in an area where
              they want to get married, even though they do not. They have to
              obtain an accommodation address. It is a most awkward situation.
              All these aspects are to be regulated.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My conviction is that marriage should be
              permanent. However, the Bill does not deal with the doctrine of
              marriage, but with the methodology of getting married. We will be
              taking a closer look at marriage when the divorce Bill comes
              before the House. At that point there will be a different form of
              debate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is a very good Bill: it will be beneficial
              to all, and I hope that it will be passed and will be up and
              running next year. Christian marriage can be beautifully and
              reverently celebrated at venues other than places of worship, and
              I do not see why ceremonies should not be performed in such
              places.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yesterday, a young lady down at the BBC tackled
              me. She had a microphone in her hand and she asked: &quot;Where is
              the most wonderful place to be married?&quot; I replied:
              &quot;Young lady, it is the wonderful woman I married that I was
              worried about — it was not the place that mattered&quot;. True
              love is the real basis for marriage — love that can stand the
              strains of time and living. The two must grow together and, as the
              scripture says, &quot;they shall be one flesh&quot;.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The great commentator Matthew Henry said when
              writing on the making of a woman that she was to remember that she
              was not taken from a man’s head so as to rule him; she was not
              taken from a man’s hand to control him; she was taken from
              beside his heart and under his arm for love and protection. Where
              love rules in a marriage then all the other situations —<br>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was telling the House about a great Bible
              commentator, Matthew Henry, who wrote about the making of woman.
              He pointed out that she was not taken from man’s head, for she
              was not for him to rule, and that she was not taken from man’s
              feet, for she was not to be trampled on. He said that she was
              taken from near man’s heart to be loved and from under his arm
              to be protected. The lesson for us all is that the supremacy of
              love is the basis for the ideal marriage and for the permanence of
              marriage. Love can sweeten all things — even marriage.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Members who contributed to this short
              debate on the Marriage Bill. Their remarks were essentially
              complimentary. They appreciated the fact that the Bill is before
              the House, they appreciated the work of the advisory committee on
              the recommendations on which the Bill is based and they
              complimented the Committee on the wide consultation before the
              Bill was drafted.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Committee for Finance
              and Personnel, Mr Molloy, highlighted the consultation with that
              Committee. He underlined its exemplary nature, holding it up to
              other Committees as a model for consultation in the early stages
              of preparing Bills. I thank him for his appreciation of the work
              of my departmental officials.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In welcoming the Bill, Ms Lewsley asked why the
              legislation is being introduced now. Given the references to the
              Scottish legislation, one could say that it is long overdue.
              Pressure was mounting, especially from religious organisations and
              churches, Christian and non-Christian, that feel that they are not
              treated with the same consideration in legislation as other
              religions are. They feel that the way in which they are ignored or
              treated differently could amount to a form of discrimination. As
              we must have regard to our equality legislation, the matter was
              urgent.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the process, some 90 religious
              organisations were consulted. That number surprises me, but,
              nonetheless, it indicates the extent to which the committee and
              officials from my Department were prepared to go, following the
              committee’s recommendations, to ensure that all views and
              concerns related to those aspects of marriage were fully consulted
              on and satisfaction achieved with respect to them. I acknowledge
              the appreciation expressed by Dr Paisley, as a representative of
              one of the smaller churches, at least in numerical strength — I
              hope he does not mind me putting it in that way — with regard to
              the attempt to achieve satisfaction, fair treatment and equality
              for all the groups concerned.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Patricia Lewsley, in highlighting venues that
              might be used for the conduct of marriage ceremonies in Northern
              Ireland, mentioned the Giant’s Causeway and Carrick-a-Rede,
              which are within my own and Dr Paisley’s constituency. I trust
              that numbers will flock to those venues to solemnise their
              marriages, if they wish to step outside the more traditional
              locations. I do not imagine that venues of such considerable
              beauty, providing a dramatic setting and start to married life,
              could be found anywhere else in Northern Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The degree of satisfaction expressed by those
              who have spoken, and the silence of those who have not, indicates

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill is necessary to enable Northern
              Ireland to meet its European commitments in a key environmental
              area. It is also necessary to ensure that the people of Northern
              Ireland enjoy the same standard of environmental protection as
              elsewhere in the United Kingdom. This legislation should have been
              in place in 1999, and the reasons behind the delay are, no doubt,
              well known to the Assembly. However, its continued absence is
              already subject to infraction proceedings from Europe. It is
              vital, therefore, that it be brought into operation as quickly as
              possible if we are to avoid the real possibility of financial
              penalties for non-compliance.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The main purpose of the Bill, and the
              subordinate legislation to be made under it, is to provide a
              statutory framework to enable transposition of EC Directive 96/61
              on integrated pollution prevention and control. That Directive is
              designed to control pollution from industrial sources. Its aim is
              to provide for a high level of protection for the environment
              through the establishment of a regulatory framework to prevent or
              reduce emissions to air, water and land as a result of industrial
              activities. The Directive’s key feature is that it provides for
              an integrated approach to dealing with pollution from major
              industrial installations. That is designed to avoid potential
              problems that may arise if separate approaches are taken to
              controlling releases to air, water and land. That integrated
              approach is similar to the current arrangements under the
              Industrial Pollution Control (Northern Ireland) Order 1997.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill shares many features with the current
              arrangements under the 1997 Order. Most importantly, it will
              provide for the retention of the regulatory structures of that
              Order, with a chief inspector assuming responsibility for
              regulating those installations listed in annex 1 of the Directive.
              That means that all such installations will be assessed against
              their capacity to cause significant pollution to air, water and
              land. Moreover, the provisions and regulatory structures of the
              1997 Order will be repealed and re-enacted in the new legislation.
              That will remove the need for pollution from industrial
              installations to be regulated under two separate pieces of
              legislation, and it will minimise the disruption to industry
              caused by the new arrangements.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I estimate that approximately 250 existing
              installations will be subject to the new Directive controls. Some
              are already regulated under the existing arrangements, but several
              installations will be brought under control for the first time to
              meet the Directive’s requirements. The main additions above a
              certain capacity will be: installations for intensive rearing of
              poultry and pigs; sites for landfilling waste; slaughterhouses;
              installations for the treatment and processing of milk;
              installations for the treatment and processing of animal raw
              materials; and installations for the treatment and processing of
              vegetable raw materials.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several other changes will be made to the
              current controls. Permits will be granted for installations rather
              than processes, which will enable a more broad-based and
              comprehensive approach. The range of environmental impacts to be
              covered when determining applications will be much wider and will
              include noise, site restoration, accident prevention, energy
              efficiency, and the selection and use of raw materials. No
              integrated pollution prevention and control (IPPC) installation
              will be exempted from control because of the triviality of its
              emissions.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the main, this is an enabling Bill. The
              detail of the new regulatory controls will be set out in draft
              regulations, which will be published for consultation in the next
              few weeks. In addition to providing an opportunity for full and
              open scrutiny of the proposals, publication of the draft
              regulations will help to inform consideration of the Bill as it
              goes through its various stages. The parallel processing of the
              Bill and the regulations will also ensure that all the legislation
              is enacted with the minimum of delay, thereby reducing the serious
              risks associated with the infraction proceedings, as I mentioned
              earlier.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition to providing the statutory
              framework for transposing of Directive, the Bill has two other
              main purposes. First, it will provide a general power for EU
              measures to be transposed by way of regulations, thereby avoiding
              the need for primary legislation. Any measure intended to be
              implemented in that way will be required to be designated by
              Order, and any regulations made under that provision will be
              subject to full scrutiny and consultation in the normal way.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, the Bill provides new transitional
              provisions for waste disposal licences under the Pollution Control
              and Local Government (Northern Ireland) Order 1978. That will
              facilitate the transition to the new waste management licensing
              system that is due to be introduced in 2003 and ensure that no one
              is penalised unfairly because a waste disposal licence has lapsed
              inadvertently.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Department set out its policy proposals in a
              consultation paper that was published in June 2001. The paper was
              issued to 500 organisations, groups and individuals. Some 30
              responses were received, the majority of which welcomed the
              proposals. Only 16 respondents made substantive comments. Of
              those, eight were accepted; only one response required a change in
              legislation, and the other seven can be met through clarification
              of the proposals. The remaining eight comments were rejected;
              three were outside the scope of the legislation, one was a clear
              breach of the Directive, and four were rejected on policy grounds.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill is necessary to enable us to meet our
              European commitments and to provide a high-quality environment for
              the people of Northern Ireland. For those reasons, I commend the
              Bill to the Assembly.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Committee for the
              Environment (Rev Dr William McCrea):</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In September 2001, the Committee for the
              Environment considered and responded to a consultation document
              issued by the Department of the Environment on its proposals for
              transposing EC Directive 96/61 on integrated pollution prevention
              and control. The Committee subsequently raised several concerns.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I appreciate the need for Northern Ireland to
              meet its European commitment, and the Minister and the Department’s
              desire for a high-quality environment. The debate is not riveting
              for many people, but the Pollution Prevention and Control Bill is
              important, and it has implications for the community.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When departmental officials appeared before the
              Committee and realised that members had concerns, it strove to
              deal with those and other concerns. That is appreciated. Officials
              have appeared before the Committee readily in order to clarify
              outstanding issues. They will make a presentation this Thursday
              morning as deliberations continue on the Bill.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The concerns include the potential impact on
              the poultry industry in particular, the farming industry in
              general, and the proposed level of fees across all sectors. The
              Committee will keep a close eye on how those concerns, and others
              that have been identified in our consultation exercise with key
              interest groups, have been addressed in the Bill or in the draft
              Regulations that will result from the Bill. The Minister
              emphasised the value and importance of the Regulations, and draft
              Regulations will be available to the Committee in early July.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I must advise the House of the discussions that
              the Committee has had with the Minister about his proposal to use
              the accelerated passage procedure to progress the Bill. The
              Minister wrote to me on 22 May 2002 to explain why he believed
              that it was necessary to use the accelerated passage procedure,
              thus removing any Committee Stage scrutiny of the Bill. He drew to
              the Committee’s attention the fact that infraction proceedings
              are lurking in the background and overshadowing much of the
              discussions.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although the Committee appreciates fully the
              potential cost of infraction proceedings by the EC, there was
              nothing to convince members that EC proceedings were so far
              advanced that there would not be time for the Committee to
              complete some form of scrutiny of the Bill. The Committee
              discussed the issue, and I informed the Minister, clearly and
              scrupulously, of the decision that the Committee had reached.
              There was an equally balanced decision regarding a particular
              stance, and an impasse ensued.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Consequently, the Committee suggested an
              alternative way forward to the Minister as a follow-up to his
              discussions with us on 2 June 2002. The outcome was a proposal
              from the Minister to complete the Committee Stage by
              mid-September. The Committee agreed with the proposal and I assure
              the Minister that it is still the Committee’s intent. We have no
              desire to delay the Bill, but we want appropriate and proper
              scrutiny to ensure that we take on board the considerations of
              everyone who has an interest.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is the Second Stage of the Bill. The
              Committee has been put in a position in which, if it wants to
              scrutinise the Bill, it must do so and report by mid-September.
              Some people may say that the Committee was wrong to oppose the
              Bill’s accelerated passage. They may ask why the Committee
              should put extra pressure on itself when it already has three
              Bills at Committee Stage, with another due in early September. The
              reason is simple. One of the most important roles that any
              Statutory Committee has is the scrutiny of legislation. The
              Committee believes that it would be wrong to forgo such scrutiny
              except in exceptional circumstances.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I assure the Minister that, despite the severe
              time limitations imposed on us in the circumstances, we shall be,
              as usual, diligent and thorough in examining the details of the
              Bill, and we shall return with amendments at Consideration Stage
              if necessary. The Committee has reached out to the Minister, and
              the Minister and his Department have reacted to the Committee’s
              concerns. That is a healthy exchange, and it is in the interest of
              having proper and appropriate legislation, which the community can
              feel has been scrutinised by those with that authority.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Savage:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am concerned about the Bill, because I have
              heard it mentioned in several Departments over the past week. I
              have listened carefully to the Minister, and one of my greatest
              concerns is, as is stated in paragraph 11 of the accompanying
              explanatory and financial memorandum:</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;There is no provision for any
              installations to be exempted from control, for example, because of
              the ‘triviality’ of its emissions.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the Minister explain what that means?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Furthermore, paragraph 12 states:</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Existing installations in so far as they
              are not substantially changed, were afforded a period of grace of
              up to eight years after the Directive was brought into effect,
              during which they would need to be upgraded to meet the Directive’s
              requirements. All installations therefore must be permitted by 31
              October 2007.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is all very well, and I do not wish to
              encourage pollution. However, the Minister spoke this week about
              pollution in Lough Neagh, for which the farmers are always being
              blamed. If the Minister or any other Member thinks that farmers
              are going to be a soft touch and will accept that blame, they are
              in for a surprise.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What about organisations that receive Crown
              immunity? There are far greater polluters in other sectors. Those
              matters must be taken into consideration. I have every sympathy
              for the Minister; he has a difficult job to do. However, we must
              have a level playing field. I do not want to see people blamed for
              pollution for which they are not responsible.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am standing behind the Minister now, but I
              would ask him the same question were I in front of him. Can he
              prove that the agriculture industry is the main polluter? That is
              the big factor. Many matters, including fraud, were talked about
              over the past six months in various Departments. However, when the
              cards are on the table, all accusations must be proven, and that
              is what the Minister must do.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not wish to be awkward, but I must defend
              the agriculture industry. Other sectors are given time to get
              their act together — it should be the same for everybody.
              Farmers do not want to cause pollution. They are conscious of the
              effects, and they are proud of the environment. Other people are
              more responsible for pollution, but they get away scot-free. There
              must be a level playing field.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy Chairperson of the Environment
              Committee (Ms Lewsley):</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the Minister said, the Pollution Prevention
              and Control Bill is designed to protect the environment by the
              reduction and prevention of emissions to air, water and land
              through industrial activities, and to comply with the Industrial
              Pollution, Prevention and Control (IPPC) Directive. Issues such as
              waste minimisation and the handling of waste on site are vital to
              reduce the amount of environmental pollution and to place the
              responsibility on those who produce the pollutants. The Bill
              addresses the wider range of installations, such as the intensive
              rearing of pigs and poultry, landfill sites, slaughterhouses, and
              the treatment and processing of animal and raw materials. Those
              are some of the areas affected by the new legislation — it is
              not only farmers who pollute the environment.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Permits will be granted, and issues mentioned
              by the Minister, such as noise, site restoration, accident
              prevention, energy efficiency, and raw material selection and use,
              will be taken into consideration. Installations will also have to
              show that an assessment has been conducted of the environmental
              risks and that adequate staff training and provision for
              appropriate maintenance of the system exists. The permits will be
              reviewed periodically and will take into account technology and
              other changes.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The standards, objectives and requirements will
              be regulated. I welcome the fact that the Department will make
              information accessible to the public on industrial pollution and
              waste. The issue of enforcement will be addressed through regular
              inspections, and the inspectors will have the power to take
              samples and to arrange preventative or remedial action at the
              expense of the permit holders.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Pollution Prevention and Control Bill is
              another Bill that has been forced on the Assembly by an EU
              Directive that the Assembly must implement. It is the latest in a
              long line of EU Directives that direct rule Ministers neglected to
              put in place. The consequence of not complying with the Directive
              could mean a heavy financial penalty for many ratepayers in
              Northern Ireland. I support the Bill.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.
              The introduction of the Pollution Prevention and Control Bill is
              in response to the IPPC Directive in Northern Ireland. The
              European Court of Justice delivered its judgement on 7 March 2002,
              so new legislation is required in order to avoid financial
              penalties. That could happen before the end of 2002 and will
              become a reality in 2003. That is why I support the Minister in
              getting the Bill through quickly.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is great concern in the farming
              community, and the farming industry is under financial pressures.
              An incentive scheme to improve facilities should be offered, and I
              urge the Department of the Environment to take the farmers’
              concerns into account when drawing up the final Regulations.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a need for significant improvements in
              agriculture practices. I advocate a minimum six-month storage
              requirement for organic waste on all farms and a complete ban on
              slurry spreading from October to the end of March. However,
              considering the weather that we have had recently, that would not
              work.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am putting this forward because it would
              improve water quality. Why do I come to that conclusion? The
              reason is that slurry-spreading on waterlogged or frozen ground
              creates a high risk of water pollution. There is a case for a
              straightforward prohibition of overloading land with excessive
              nitrates from slurry or fertilisers.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.30 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">General provisions in the water pollution Acts
              and waste management Acts make it an offence to cause, or to
              permit, polluting matter to enter waters, or to store, recover or
              dispose of waste in a manner that causes, or is likely to cause,
              environmental problems. However, in most cases the odds of
              securing a prosecution are stacked too high against public
              authorities, because they do not have the resources for the
              monitoring and investigations needed for widespread, effective
              enforcement. Too heavy an onus of proof is required in order to
              demonstrate that pollution occurs through careless malpractice.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am also concerned that those who cause the
              biggest pollution problems have Crown immunity. Organisations that
              cause a fish kill should be brought to book, but unfortunately,
              they are immune from prosecution. Farmers have to work through bad
              weather conditions, financial problems, et cetera. I encourage the
              Minister to do his utmost to help them. Go raibh míle maith agat.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Armstrong:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill provides a framework to control
              industrial pollution in Northern Ireland. It offers a holistic
              approach to land, water and air pollution, in line with EC
              Directive 96/61, and it aims to address industrial pollution
              setting out the framework whereby that can be achieved. However,
              it must be stressed that the Bill is only a framework.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill will affect many businesses as well as
              those in the poultry-and pig-farming sectors. Preventing pollution
              is beneficial to the environment. The role that farmers have
              played as stewards of the land must be recognised and credited.
              The Bill seeks to impose penalties for failure to comply with
              environmental standards. However, it does not set out adequately
              the best available techniques to be adopted as the yardstick to
              assess whether a business complies. It is vital that Departments
              concerned with the Bill co-operate by assisting the industries
              that will be directly affected. Departments must offer an
              incentive to comply with more stringent environmental controls.
              There is no point in forcing farmers to comply with tighter
              controls if it is simply not possible for them to do so.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With those considerations in mind, further
              environmental legislation must not only push industry into
              complying; it must lead industry through supporting schemes such
              as waste management. I fear that those whom the Bill will affect
              must be all too aware of the consequences of incorporating the EC
              Directive into our law. Current law — the Industrial Pollution
              Control (Northern Ireland) Order 1997 — weighs environmental
              concerns against the costs associated with undertaking practice
              differently. However, if the Bill were fully implemented, only
              best available techniques would be considered; financial
              considerations would be excluded.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am conscious that this new approach may be
              less favourable to industry than is the case at present. We are
              told that general binding rules may offset some of the extra
              financial burdens associated with the legislation, but we wonder
              how that can be so.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill is a framework for introducing an EU
              Directive to our law. I understand that we must avoid penalties
              from Europe, which would be imposed if the legislation were not
              introduced. However, I urge the Minister to consider the affected
              industries when determining the rigour that will be used to
              implement the Directive. Also, can he assure the House that the
              legislation is being adopted consistently throughout European
              member states?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Can the Minister clarify whether additional
              support will be given to projects such as anaerobic digesters for
              waste, in the light of the legislation? I fear that farmers could
              face fines if no realistic alternative course of action exists.
              Legislation must be fair, reasonable and lead industry to
              implement more environmentally sensitive measures, which could
              bring great benefits.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Foster:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to compliment the Mount Charles
              caterers. We were rushed out of the Building, so many people
              arrived back for lunch at the same time, and staff catered very
              well for everyone.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Having been in Dermot Nesbitt’s position, I
              do not want to say too much other than that this is a worthwhile,
              important and necessary Bill. Less pollution, urgent measures for
              its prevention and greater control will benefit society. Less
              pollution would mean better health, and with healthier people,
              there would be less medical need. The Bill is also environmentally
              friendly.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Failure to transpose the Directive into
              Northern Ireland legislation will result in infraction proceedings
              against the United Kingdom, and, although the Bill is at an
              advanced stage, the risk of heavy fines is very real. To avoid
              those fines, the Bill must be granted Royal Assent before the
              Assembly is dissolved for the May 2003 elections.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The European Court of Justice delivered its
              judgement against the United Kingdom on 7 March 2002, ruling that
              the Directive had not been implemented. Unless the Northern
              Ireland Executive can demonstrate to the European Commission that
              the necessary legislation has been enacted, the Commission will go
              back to the European Court of Justice to have financial penalties
              imposed. That could happen before the end of 2002, with fines
              imposed in mid- to late-2003.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the Minister has said, the Bill is largely
              enabling, and the Environment Committee will be able to consider
              fully its substance. I support the need to implement the Bill —
              it is more important than most people realise.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Nesbitt:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Members for their comments. I will
              address each in the order in which they were made. I thank the
              Chairperson of the Environment Committee, Dr McCrea, for his
              comments and for appreciating the need for speedy implementation.
              That is important. He referred to accelerated passage, and the
              fact that need and efficient delivery have equal priority. I
              appreciate that he must do something by September, but I have not
              put him in that position. I think that it was a necessity; it put
              us all in that position. Therefore, I thank him for his clear
              intention to have that completed by September 2002.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He mentioned agriculture, as did other Members.
              I am conscious that more Members seem to raise issues at the
              Second Stages of environmental Bills than in relation to other
              Bills at that Stage. He referred to the potential impact of the
              Bill on poultry farming and the farming industry in general. The
              extension applies to poultry and pigs only at a certain level —
              whether it may be 4,000 poultry, 750 sows or 2,000 pigs. The Bill
              applies only to establishments with that number of animals and
              birds.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No installation will be exempt from the new
              controls. No one is excluded. The Department can do nothing about
              that. That has been made clear. The Department has no option but
              to bring such poultry and pig installations under the new
              controls. Failure to do so would be a clear breach of the EU
              Directive, and would expose the Department to the risk of further
              infraction proceedings. The thresholds that I referred to are set
              out in the Directive, and must be applied.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am conscious of the need to alleviate costs
              to the farming sector. Mr Savage said that farmers are being
              blamed for pollution. I come from a farming background and an
              agricultural constituency, and I put it on the record that I do
              not blame farmers. I want the polluter — whoever that may be —
              to pay. The principle that applies in waste management should do
              so in this context also. The principle of proximity is also
              similar: he who creates the problem should deal with the problem.
              I want to make that clinically clear.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the Department wants to assist where
              possible. For example, the Directive says that the installations
              that I have referred to do not have to be phased in until October
              2007. In that case, I propose to defer the call-up for existing
              agricultural installations until November 2006 to January 2007.
              The Department will put that off for as long as possible in an
              effort to accommodate the agriculture industry. However, new
              installations, and those that have undergone changes, must be
              brought into line with the Directive immediately.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department has also tried to accommodate
              the agriculture industry with regard to the charges that will be
              applied. I stress that those matters will be subject to regulation
              and consultation. They are not part of the enabling power but will
              go through full consultation. The charges will be in line with
              those in Great Britain, which have been reduced from the original
              estimates in order to lessen the impact on the agriculture sector.
              Those are two examples of how the Department is trying to
              accommodate that sector.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to address the comments made by my party
              Colleague Mr Savage, who asked why there is no provision for the
              exemption of triviality. It is quite simple; there are two
              relevant issues that I want to explain. Under the 1997
              legislation, trivial pollution could be dismissed; there is no
              such exception in this Bill. However, in trivial cases, the level
              of charges will reflect the extent of the seriousness. Although
              there is no exclusion, allowances are made. Therefore, a balance
              is struck.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.45 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I referred to the fact that farmers are being
              blamed all the time. Farmers are not soft touches. I have never
              thought that for one minute. As the saying goes, they know which
              side their bread is buttered on. I have every sympathy with the
              farming community. My officials have closely liaised with the
              Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, and with the
              farming industry, on the issues associated with the introduction
              of the new controls. Earlier this year, officials made a
              presentation to the Northern Ireland Poultry Federation and the
              central pigs committee of the Ulster Farmers’ Union on the
              implications of this Directive for intensive pig and poultry
              farms.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since then, two working groups, involving my
              officials, officials from the Department of Agriculture and Rural
              Development and industry representatives, have met to discuss the
              detailed requirements of the Directives and how they can be
              applied to the farming industry. The groups will continue to meet
              as necessary in the lead-up to the introduction of the
              legislation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am very conscious of the farming sector. I
              meet with its representatives and will continue to do so. The
              agrisector is about more than farming, and I am conscious of the
              contribution that it makes to the gross domestic product of
              Northern Ireland. I am also conscious of the smallness of farms
              and the difficulties faced by the agriculture sector in Northern
              Ireland. As an elected body in Northern Ireland, the Assembly
              should be conscious of, and take cognisance of, those factors. I
              have tried to mention aspects where we have done that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Deputy Chairperson of the
              Environment Committee for her support for the Bill. I also thank
              Mick Murphy for his comments about recognising the farming
              community’s concerns. I hope that I addressed that. We will
              continue to address those concerns. Mr Murphy also raised the
              issue of Crown immunity — that issue has not gone away. It
              remains a live issue that must be dealt with.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Armstrong mentioned best available
              techniques and how to deal with them. Best available techniques
              are prepared on an EU-wide basis to identify the best techniques
              for the prevention or minimisation of pollution, taking sectoral
              affordability into account. That will inform the national
              technique guidance, which is uniformly applied across the United
              Kingdom. That aspect was also raised by Mr Armstrong.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A further purpose of best available techniques
              is to inform the decision-making process for individual permits.
              Whether it be the chief inspector or the district councils making
              the decisions, the Department will still have a role to play in
              ensuring consistency.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Armstrong mentioned anaerobic digesters. My
              officials will carefully take note of Hansard and reply directly
              to him about that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The matter of whether general binding rules
              could apply, as opposed to issuing permits to individuals, was
              raised. I hope that they can apply, avoiding the need for
              individually tailored permits and thus reducing the costs
              involved. That is a further element of the attempt to reduce
              costs, which is required for the benefit of Northern Ireland. I
              thank my predecessor, Mr Foster, for his supportive comments,
              which were mindful of the benefit to Northern Ireland and of the
              costs involved, as well as of the sensitivity of the matter.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank those who made constructive comments,
              and I acknowledge again the positive contribution made by the Rev
              Dr William McCrea and the Committee for the Environment to this
              sensitive issue. I commend the Bill to the Assembly.</p>

              Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill (NIA&nbsp;7/01).</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With your permission, Madam Deputy Speaker, I
              shall explain why my Committee seeks an extension. The Committee
              began its formal consideration of the Bill on 21 May 2002. Since
              that date the Committee has consulted all local councils, the
              Society of Local Authority Chief Executives and the Northern
              Ireland Local Government Association to hear their views on the
              proposed legislation; and it took oral evidence from
              representatives of Craigavon Council and Belfast City Council and
              from officials of the Department of the Environment and of the
              Northern Ireland Office.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Consideration of this Bill is challenging in
              that it proposes to legislate by introducing new provisions in
              three unrelated areas. The first of those is a new method for
              distributing the general grant payable to local councils. The Bill
              also includes provision for reducing the general grant where it is
              held that a council has failed to deliver a reasonable standard of
              economy, efficiency and effectiveness in discharging its
              functions.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, the Bill provides for new powers on
              economic development, effectively removing the limit of five pence
              in the pound on economic development for those councils wishing to
              invest more. Moreover, councils must have regard to guidance from
              the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, the Bill provides for new council
              powers on community safety. These will allow a council to
              participate in a relevant community safety partnership. However,
              they will also allow the Department of the Environment to bring
              forward an order to the Assembly to confer or impose on councils
              other functions to enhance community safety in their areas.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">None of the issues was straightforward, and the
              Committee identified significant amendments that must be made to
              the Bill. They affect all the areas mentioned and would result in
              changes to four of the principal clauses of the 11-clause Bill.
              The departmental officials responsible for the Bill have worked
              diligently and have been responsive to the Committee’s queries.
              It is to be hoped that the Minister will agree to table the
              Committee’s amendments, and possibly some others, for the
              Consideration Stage debate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee needs time to explore other
              issues outlined in this complex Bill. Last week, it received a
              substantial submission from the Northern Ireland Office, which
              seeks to define community safety partnerships and to clarify how
              they differ from district policing partnerships. The extension to
              the Committee Stage is necessary because the outstanding issues
              will require due and proper deliberation by the Committee.
              Therefore it is necessary to ask the Assembly for this extension.
              However, the Committee hopes to complete its work by an earlier
              date. I ask Members to support the motion.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I should like Members to keep those thoughts in
              mind during the debate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first motion, which is on the report by the
              Senior Salaries Review Body (SSRB), seeks the Assembly’s
              agreement to implement recommendations 2 to 9 of the review body’s
              report. It also seeks agreement for recommendation 1 to be
              reviewed at a later date.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recommendation 2 relates to payments for the
              Chairpersons of the Committee of the Centre and the Public
              Accounts Committee. The report comments that those two Standing
              Committees</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;are regarded as Committees with

              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report recommends that those Chairpersons
              should receive the same remuneration as the Statutory Committees’
              Chairpersons. It is estimated that that sum be £22,000 in this
              financial year. The second motion proposes the changes to the
              Northern Ireland Assembly (Members’ Salaries) Determination 2000
              that are necessary to enable those payments to be made.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recommendation 3 of the SSRB report says that</p>

              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That recommendation was made because of
              concerns that the SSRB raised about the slippage that has occurred
              in the differential between the salaries of MPs and MLAs. However,
              I shall return to that point in more detail shortly.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;should be able to employ the equivalent

              Members.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recommendations 5 and 7 relate to an increase

              constituency duties effectively, and to assist individuals
              bringing problems to them. This will require a fairly substantial

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;the current low levels of the OCA is an
              obstacle to the development of the Assembly: it deters Members

              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion proposing a change in the Northern
              Ireland Assembly (Members’ Allowances) Determination 2000 will
              give effect to the increase in the office costs allowance to
              £48,000 if the Assembly approves. That cost is estimated to be
              £1·28 million.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">From previous debates on such matters, Members
              will know that the winding-up allowance for them is set at one
              third of office costs allowance. The current winding-up allowance
              is £11,617. If the Assembly approves the increase in OCA, a
              consequential increase should be made to that. The draft Statutory
              Rule laid in the Business Office on 17 June titled The Allowances
              to Members of the Assembly (Winding Up Allowance) (Amendment)
              Order (Northern Ireland) 2002 makes provision for that to be
              increased to £16,000. That would come into operation on the day
              after the Assembly approved it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Following on from the recommendations that
              provide for an increase in OCA to allow Members to employ two
              members of support staff, the SSRB has suggested in
              recommendations 6 and 8 that</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;the Assembly Commission provide Members
              with guidance on standards and rental costs for offices [and that
              there should be] an increase in the central IT provision to
              include equipment for up to two members of staff for each
              MLA&quot;.</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If that is agreed, the Commission will develop
              the guidance as suggested by the SSRB. The Commission will also
              put in place the necessary procedures for the provision of IT
              equipment for up to two members of staff for each Member, if the
              Assembly accepts that recommendation. The capital cost is
              estimated at £216,000, with annual running costs of £10,000.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The SSRB points out that, at present, Members
              are required to fund from OCA any changes necessary to
              constituency offices to meet the requirements of the disability
              discrimination legislation. In recommendation 9, the review body
              recommends that</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;the Assembly considers central funding
              for costs arising from statutory requirements on disability.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If that recommendation is accepted, the
              Commission will give detailed and careful consideration to it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall now deal briefly with recommendation 1
              in the SSRB report, which relates to Members’ salaries, and ask
              Members to cast their minds back to my opening remarks. The SSRB
              has recommended that</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;the slippage in an MLA’s salaries in
              comparison with that of a Westminster MP should be made
              good.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1999, the SSRB considered that the job
              weighting of an Assembly Member was 82% of that of a Westminster
              MP. In the present report, the review body reaches the same
              conclusions and proposes that the ratio of 82% should be retained.
              With the annual upgrading of salaries, that would increase Members’
              salaries to £45,250.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members need to be clear about the consequences
              of not adhering to the review body’s salary recommendation. To
              not implement the recommendation means stepping away from the
              principle of job weightings established by the review body, which
              the Assembly previously accepted and endorsed. It will mean that
              the job weighting of an MLA will drop to 74%, below that of a
              Member of the National Assembly for Wales, which does not have
              primary legislation powers.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members will know from the ‘First report of
              the Northern Ireland Assembly Commission’, which was debated in
              the Assembly yesterday, of the work accomplished by the Assembly
              and its Members from devolution in December 1999 to 31 March 2002.
              There were 125 plenary meetings, 8,477 questions for written
              answer, and 1,168 Committee meetings, with most Members sitting on
              two, and some on three, Committees. Some 71 Committee reports were
              produced and 34 Bills were introduced. Members will also know that
              in the past seven weeks 18 Bills have been introduced. None of
              that takes into account the amount of constituency work in which
              Members are also involved. That is the work of the Assembly. It is
              a sad comment on the standard of some of our reporters that they
              have not had the intelligence to accept that the Assembly does
              more than work one day a week.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Commission is well aware of some Members’
              views about increasing their salaries and is also aware of the
              views held by some that the Assembly is still not fully
              functioning, and that Members’ salaries should not, therefore,
              be increased.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I leave Members to draw their own conclusions
              from what I have said about whether the Assembly is functioning
              fully. In the light of Members’ and parties’ views on the
              salary increase recommended by the SSRB, the Commission proposes
              that no action be taken on the implementation of that
              recommendation at this time.</p>

              Sinn Féin’s position on pay increases is a matter of record, as
              is its opposition to any increase in the office costs allowance.
              In previous debates, Members have said that we could not reject
              the SSRB’s report. However, in the run-up to an election,
              Members have changed their tune and are running scared of the
              perception that they are lining their pockets, while all around
              them they see the consequences of poverty.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the Assembly first debated the issue, John

              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The Assembly, when in shadow form, took

              recommendations on salaries, allowances and pensions.&quot; — <i>[Official

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The Assembly Commission feels strongly,
              however, that it would be wrong to depart from the principles of
              the SSRB’s recommendations in the area of salaries, allowances
              or pensions. By following SSRB consistently we have an open and
              transparent method of fixing our remuneration and allowances
              package as recommended by an independent panel of experts. This
              gives us a sound basis on which to justify this package to our
              constituents and the wider public. Once we depart in one area from
              SSRB recommendations we lose the whole basis and justification for
              following the remainder.&quot; — <i>[Official Report, Vol 5,

              for Members here, regardless of what some other body may do or
              what legitimacy some other body may offer, to decide whether it is
              justified in voting, out of the public purse, emoluments and
              benefits of this kind. I submit that it is not. If Members
              continue in this, they will undermine public support. They will be

              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The Assembly was entirely right to hand
              the determination of its salaries and allowances to the Senior
              Salaries Review Body (SSRB). However, the proposal for a
              substantial increase needs to be debated in the Chamber. If the
              SSRB had recommended a £10,000 cut in Members’ wages, there
              would definitely have been some debate. The Assembly should not
              run away from this…</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proposal for such a substantial increase
              when so many live under huge disadvantage must be looked at very
              seriously, especially as this is the first sitting of the Assembly
              since the transfer of powers. If the Assembly’s first act on
              receiving those powers is to vote itself a substantial pay rise,
              that will send out entirely the wrong message. Many people are
              living on less than the proposed increase, so it is only right
              that the Commission deliberate this matter further.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A number of points relate to my party and to
              pay increases. Sinn Féin Members did not take the salaries
              allowed during the shadow period. They took an allowance from the
              party, and no increases are planned for party members — even if
              salary increases are agreed. There is no difference between the
              treatment of Ministers and that of Back-Benchers, and, when
              setting up constituency offices, which provide an excellent
              service, the party decided that no family members would be
              considered for posts in them.&quot; — <i>[Official Report, Vol

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the Assembly first agreed the motion from
              the shadow Executive, the shadow Commission urged the Assembly to
              commit itself to accepting the recommendation of the SSRB on
              Members’ salaries and other costs. That would mean making a
              commitment to accept the SSRB recommendation unseen, not only with
              regard to the report that we expect to be published within the
              next week, but the remainder of the life of the Assembly. Of
              course, subsequent Assemblies can decide whether to follow that
              practice.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If Members have views on the level of their
              salaries, they can meet the SSRB to express them. If the public
              believe that Members are being paid too much, they can contact the
              SSRB and make their case. Sinn Féin, like other parties, has met
              with the SSRB. We also made a written submission rejecting a pay
              rise and an increase in the office costs allowance.</p>

              public. The public scrutinise our actions closely, which is both
              appropriate and welcome, and we have a duty to show that we are
              restrictive in rewarding finances to ourselves.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1999, Sinn Féin welcomed the placing of
              decisions on salary rates with the SSRB. It makes for a more
              transparent and accountable system of government, and is
              preferable to MLAs deciding their own pay. However, that does not
              tie us to accepting the recommendations, or to making
              representations, to the SSRB.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members also say that we cannot vote in favour
              of a pay rise for ourselves because the Assembly has not proved
              itself. Whatever the merits of that argument are, the reality is
              that we have already voted in favour of two substantial pay
              increases. We reject the proposal to increase the office costs
              allowance. Yes, there are good arguments in favour of employing
              more staff in our constituency offices, but it appears the height
              of hypocrisy to vote for an increase in personal office cost
              allowances, especially for those who voice the argument that we
              have yet to prove ourselves as an Assembly. Go raibh maith agat.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I listened to what the previous speaker said,
              and, insofar as she reiterates the views that I expressed in a
              previous debate, I endorse those views. I am happy that the
              Commission, in view of the public reaction to the proposed
              increase in salary, has acted with a degree of wisdom, and has
              decided to recommend to the Assembly that, at this time, there
              will be no acceptance of the SSRB’s suggestion that the salary
              should be increased to £45,000 or thereabouts.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I voiced my opposition to the acceptance of
              that increase publicly and shared a radio programme with the
              Minister of the Environment, Mr Nesbitt. Among other things, he
              indicated that democracy did not come cheaply, and therefore, to
              some extent, this pay rise would be justifiable. Like Rev Robert
              Coulter, he reiterated the vast amount of work that Members are
              alleged to be undertaking. All I can say is that, on that
              occasion, something like 20-odd people phoned in and not a single
              member of the public endorsed Mr Nesbitt’s view. Moreover,
              insofar as the proposed increase was the subject of communications
              to the press, I do not recollect a single letter in the local
              newspapers that endorsed any acceptance of the review body’s
              recommendation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is to be welcomed that the Commission has
              shown a great degree of wisdom in recognising the public view of a
              salary increase at this time. That is so, bearing in mind the
              enormous black hole in the capital infrastructure of the Province,
              and the enormous amount of money that will be required to make it
              good. It also takes note of the tremendous defects in the services
              that are being offered to the people of Northern Ireland,
              particularly health services. Our waiting lists now enjoy the
              unenviable distinction of being not only the longest in the United
              Kingdom, but in Europe. Therefore, as the previous speaker
              mentioned, it would be very difficult, to use a Northern Ireland
              expression, for the public to thole an increase in MLAs’
              salaries at a time when there is such a need for both capital
              moneys and improved services for those whom we purport to serve.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Fee:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank those Members who have participated in
              the debate. I shall be brief. I wish to reiterate that this
              initiative was not taken on the whim of the Assembly Commission.
              There is a statutory obligation under the Northern Ireland Act
              1998 to try to advance certain measures and supports for all
              Members. The Commission has tried to do that as diligently and
              transparently as possible. Therefore, it is somewhat disappointing
              that we are damned if we do and damned if we do not when it comes
              to Members’ salaries and other supports.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Colleagues on the Commission and I have
              always defended the principle that Members should not, under any
              circumstances, be responsible for setting their own rates of pay,
              and we are not doing that. We defended, and it was agreed, that
              the recommendations of an independent body — the Senior Salaries
              Review Body — should be accepted. I said in the House that the
              recommendations should be accepted sight unseen. That is still the
              safest and best way forward.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This time around, the review body has made two
              recommendations. Recommendation 1 would have meant a substantial
              rise in Members’ salaries. However, recommendation 3 states that</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;a review of the relevant salaries in the
              Northern Ireland Assembly should be undertaken.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Therefore, we are trying to interpret the SSRB,
              to be fair and to implement precisely what it is saying without
              prejudice about what the end salary of future MLAs might be. We
              are protecting the principle that those figures and supports
              should be determined in comparison with other public
              organisations, the Civil Service and other public servants.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I must point out the context of the package of
              proposals that will be discussed this afternoon. This is being
              done in the light of a pay and grading review for all Assembly
              Secretariat staff. One of today’s motions will restore the link
              between Members’ salaries and the Civil Service. It is being
              done in a context in which we shall not take a substantial pay
              rise. No Member or party asked for that, and I understand that no
              Member has any appetite to accept it. We are trying to consider
              the pay, grading and conditions of everybody who works within or
              for this organisation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members need the proper resources and
              information technology, and also properly qualified staff who are
              suitably paid to ensure that they can perform their role,
              represent their people, scrutinise legislation, et cetera. If the
              recommendations are accepted, the Commission will introduce
              guidance on issues such as rental for offices, terms and
              conditions, and the salary levels for our staff.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is not an isolated issue; it is part and
              parcel of being a good employer. We are trying to be an employer
              of choice, and we are trying to ensure that the people who come to
              work in the Assembly have the resources that they need. It may be
              a dreadful flaw that we must return to the Chamber every year to
              debate the issue. By holding our breath and accepting a
              recommendation that we review everything connected with Members’
              salaries, I hope that we can get a system in future that will not
              permit this unseemly occurrence. Nonetheless, it must be done.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The recommendations are properly thought out in
              the right context. A new mandate and new Members will arrive next
              year. Our responsibility now is to ensure that public
              representatives have the resources that they need to do the job.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the Assembly accepts the recommendations, an
              MP’s salary will be £55,000, a Member of the Scottish
              Parliament’s salary will be £48,000, a Member of the National
              Assembly for Wales’s salary will be £41,500 and MLAs here will
              receive £41,321. I do not believe that we can be open to a charge
              of any great extravagance.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, there is a recommendation for the
              Assembly Commission to consider central funding for the provision
              of disabled access to constituency offices. That would be
              difficult and could be enormously costly. The Commission wants the
              commitment from the Assembly that we implement that recommendation
              although I suspect that it will take some time to devise how it
              can be done properly.</p>

              assistance to opposition parties has been paid in the House of
              Commons since 1975. It is known as &quot;Short money&quot; after
              the then Leader of the House of Commons, the Rt Hon Edward Short.
              The purpose of the scheme is to assist opposition parties in the
              Commons to carry out their essential parliamentary duties. It is,
              however, important to point out, and particularly relevant in the
              context of the proposed revised scheme for the parties in the
              Assembly, that in addition to &quot;Short money&quot; in
              Westminster, the Government Whips’ Office has a budget of about
              £1 million a year. An additional scheme provides funding for
              costs incurred in the running of the office of the Leader of the
              Opposition.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The arrangements in Westminster were examined
              by its Committee on Standards in Public Life, chaired by Lord
              Neill of Bladen. In its fifth report of October 1998, the Neill
              Committee examined funding for political parties in the devolved
              institutions. In respect of the devolved institutions and the
              Assembly, the Committee said that it was</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;aware that the procedures of the UK
              Parliament — within which Short money operates — may well not
              be directly appropriate to them, especially the Northern Ireland
              Assembly, which is designed to have an Executive Committee drawn
              from all the parties in the Assembly… We would on these grounds,
              support some form of funding to political parties within the
              Scottish Parliament and the two Assemblies for the purpose of the
              better performance of their parliamentary or assembly functions.
              It may be that the funding should be made available to all the
              parties, not just the minority parties.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In December 1999, when the Assembly debated the
              Second Stage of the Financial Assistance for Political Parties
              Bill, the only Member to speak was the mover of the motion, John
              Fee, who presented the Bill on behalf of the Commission. No issues
              were raised by Members at that Stage or at the Bill’s
              Consideration Stage on 25 January 2000. That could have been
              viewed as a tacit acceptance of the scheme and the financial
              assistance that it would provide. However, the Bill merely made
              provision for a scheme to be laid before the Assembly for
              approval. It did not include any detail or information about the
              provisions of the scheme.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The scheme, which is in operation, was made by
              the Secretary of State on 4 April 2000, as the Assembly was in
              suspension at the time. It provides for payment of up to £20,000
              for each party and up to £2,000 for each seat in the Assembly
              held by a member of that party. Since then, there has been growing
              concern among Members and some parties about the level of
              financial assistance available under the current scheme. The
              proposals set out in the revised scheme provide for a payment of
              up to £24,000 for each party with one Member, £48,000 for each
              party with two or more Members and £3,000 for each Member
              connected with a political party who is under the direction of the
              party Whip and who does not hold a ministerial or junior
              ministerial post.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The core element of funding for a party with
              two Members or more has been set at £48,000 to provide funding
              for the payment of the necessary support staff and for costs
              associated with running an office, such as rental and IT support.
              That is based on the recommendations in the report of the SSRB as
              the amount required for office cost allowance for the employment
              of two members of staff and for office costs.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The current level of payment for each seat in
              the Assembly held by a Member has been increased from £2,000 to
              £3,000, and that is intended to reflect the contribution made by
              most Members to the work of the Assembly, including work in the
              Committees.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report by the SSRB in relation to party
              allowances stated:</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;In our view the current arrangements in
              the Northern Ireland Assembly may place some Parties at a
              disadvantage. Because the working arrangements in the Assembly are
              very different from those at Westminster and in the other devolved
              bodies, we see a case for the Assembly developing new arrangements
              which are appropriate to their particular circumstances.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Commission has therefore proposed in the
              revised scheme that each party should receive some element of core
              funding, irrespective of whether they are represented in the
              Executive. In Westminster there is substantial funding for the
              Government Whips’ Office and the Office of the Leader of the
              Opposition. However, in recognition of the assistance that
              Ministers and junior Ministers receive from Special Advisers and
              their supporting teams of civil servants — including research
              staff — the Commission proposes that parties should not receive
              the payment of £3,000 for each Member in a ministerial or junior
              ministerial post.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The increased cost in this financial year will
              be £322,000. That is a rise from £416,000 to £738,000 and can
              be met from the existing budget for 2002-03.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The drawing up of the scheme was a difficult
              task and, on behalf of the Assembly Commission, I thank the
              Commission staff and the acting head of finance for their
              consistent help. I commend the motion and the revised scheme to
              the Assembly.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCartney:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issue of increasing party costs goes to the
              heart of the nature of democratic practice in the Assembly. On
              more than one occasion I have referred to the fact that democracy
              in a real sense is not practised here. The fundamental principle
              of representative democracy in any modern Government is that the
              electorate may turn out a Government and replace it with another.
              That does not happen here. There is, in point of fact, no way —
              no matter how many elections we may hold — that the same people
              will not be returned in broadly the same numbers by broadly the
              same parties, who will nominate their members of the Government.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a result, unlike Westminster, the Scottish
              Parliament and the National Assembly for Wales, there is no true
              opposition in this Assembly. The four major parties, with seats
              representing more than 90 Members, form the Executive of Northern
              Ireland. They may suggest that they are the opposition — indeed,
              I have suggested previously that what we have here are
              10&nbsp;independent political warlordships.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the Minister of Health is under pressure,
              do her Colleagues in the Executive gather round, as one would
              expect in an ordinary democratic Government, to support her on the
              basis of some collective responsibility? Not a bit of it — they
              all weigh in. When the Minister of the Environment or the Minister
              for Regional Development is in a similar position, everyone acts
              as an Opposition in accordance with not the best interests of
              Northern Ireland, but the best interests of their party as they
              conceive them at that time. There is no Opposition, because all
              the major parties are in Government, and all the major parties,
              with the exception of Sinn Féin and the Alliance Party, have,
              apparently, through the agency of the Commission, endorsed the
              scheme.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us consider the original purpose of
              &quot;Short money&quot;. As Leader of the House of Commons, Edward
              Short introduced the concept of &quot;Short money&quot; on
              20&nbsp;March 1975. He had this to say as the conceptual basis for
              its payment:</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;In these days it is becoming increasingly
              difficult for Opposition parties to keep up with those who are
              backed by the vast resources of Government, either in research or
              in administration. We believe that a healthy and lively Opposition
              is an essential part of democracy, and we feel that our proposals
              will go a little way towards redressing the balance between
              Government and Opposition. The position is becoming increasingly
              difficult because of the increasing complexity of the issues with
              which Parliament is faced, and, of course, it is partly due to
              rising prices.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What we have here is 10, nay 11, Departments
              all benefiting and being run by the four major parties — not by
              anybody else — who act as a Government. Where is the Opposition,
              when everyone except the minor parties is in power, when everyone
              except the minor parties is in Government, when everyone except
              the minor parties has the benefit of an enormous pyramid of
              skilled civil servants in their Departments to give advice and
              direction?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Not only does the Civil Service, with its
              benefits and experience, offer a continuum of Government, but we
              also have a modern accretion: Special Advisers. Each Minister has
              a Special Adviser, and four, if not six, are attached to the
              &quot;Department of the Centre&quot;. They are on a salary of
              between £55,000 and £75,000. All the Special Advisers are
              available to the major parties in Government. Therefore, one asks
              why, given the principles on which &quot;Short money&quot; was
              established in the House of Commons, are we now going to deluge
              them not with the present £412,000 — of which they have the
              overwhelming portion — but with an added £312,000 or £314,000?</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.45 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most of the vast increase of more than
              £300,000 is going to parties that are not in opposition, and
              their receipt of that does not conform to the basic principles
              upon which Edward Short advanced the idea of &quot;Short
              money&quot;. Those parties benefit from all the services that the
              Opposition in Westminster at that time was denied and that
              &quot;Short money&quot; was supposed to furnish. It has been
              suggested that the provision is being made because Northern
              Ireland is not the same as anywhere else, and of course it is not.
              However, even in Scotland the ordinary principles of a devolved
              democracy apply: a party with an overall majority or a party in
              coalition with others to form a majority runs the country in
              accordance with the accepted normal principles of democracy. That
              is not so here. We do not have democracy; we have a thing called
              democracy in that we are allowed elections, and now we have the
              travesty of the larger parties wanting it both ways. They want to
              be in Government under d’Hondt, which affords them the benefit
              of Ministries and the services of the Civil Service and its
              Special Advisers. However, lo and behold, when it comes to
              &quot;Short money&quot;, they want, by waving some magical wand,
              to become the Opposition and so be entitled to the money that they
              claim ought to be theirs under the &quot;Short money&quot;
              principle.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issuing of &quot;Short money&quot;, the
              parties to which it is to be paid and the suggested increases show
              the fundamental principle that Westminster Governments have
              employed for years — corrupt political life in devolved
              Government with money, first through salaries and now through the
              parties with this additional money. It is for the House to decide
              whether it is right that, despite a vast shortage of money for
              hospitals, schools, housing, roads and water and sewerage systems,
              a substantial sum of more than £300,000 should be offered to
              political parties other than on the fundamental principles upon
              which the concept of &quot;Short money&quot; was based. It is for
              the Assembly to decide whether it will be advancing its image with
              the public, who will go short if the parties accept the benefit of
              &quot;Short money&quot;.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Fee:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I speak from my party Benches, because I am not
              contributing on behalf of the Assembly Commission, though I have
              some insight into its thinking. It is because of the dreadful
              flaws in the principles behind the &quot;Short money&quot; in
              Westminster that the Commission has produced a scheme that will
              not allow abuses that pertain in Westminster to be replicated
              here.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Consider all the money available to run the
              Government Whips’ Office, which is paid for by the Prime
              Minister’s office, and the £1 million-plus that allows the
              Government Whips’ Office to control Back-Benchers, dissenters,
              opposition, the business of the House, and so on. By comparison,
              in this Assembly, where we have a much higher level of scrutiny of
              legislation, we have Committees with policy development proposals,
              and we have Back-Bench Members who form, in many cases, the
              opposition to their Colleagues in the Government. We have rules
              that Special Advisers cannot give our political parties the type
              of support that is given in Britain or cannot put the brakes on
              them. We have such a different system. The Commission’s view is
              to ensure that every Member, in every aspect of his job, whether
              as a constituency representative, a legislator or a scrutineer on
              a Committee, has the type of support that Members at Westminster
              have.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not for one moment believe that Mr
              McCartney is suggesting that the Assembly should introduce or
              support a budget like that which exists to run the Government
              Whips’ Office in Britain, where full-time civil servants are
              involved in supporting the Government parties. The Commission
              wants to ensure that every Member and every political party —
              big or small — has the resources to enable them to do his or her
              job. That means asking what the core costs are. The core costs are
              those that are required to run an office, with secretaries and
              perhaps some research staff.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly has a wonderful research service,
              which ensures that every Member — if he or she wishes to dissent
              from what is happening — has the necessary resources. If Members
              need research to be carried out, they can have that service. The
              Commission has also been trying to ensure that nobody will be able
              to muzzle an individual Member — whether pro-agreement or
              anti-agreement, and whether he or she belongs to an Executive
              party, an opposition party, or none at all. We still have to
              resolve that last one.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although Edward Short did a good job, the
              Government response in Britain was to put up a massive budget to
              enable them to run their own Whips’ Office. That would be wholly
              undemocratic in Northern Ireland. The Commission’s proposals are
              fair enough to allow every party and every Member to make his or
              her own judgement on how to represent constituents.</p>
