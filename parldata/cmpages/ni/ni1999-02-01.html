                </font></b><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">By virtue of paragraph 1 of the schedule to
                the Northern&nbsp;Ireland (Elections) Act 1998, it falls to the
                Secretary of State to determine where meetings of the Assembly
                shall be held and when. I have received a letter to the Assembly
                from the Secretary of State directing that it shall meet at
                Parliament&nbsp;Buildings, Stormont at 10.30&nbsp;am on Monday
                1&nbsp;February until 6.00&nbsp;pm on Tuesday 23&nbsp;February.
                The Secretary of State has also indicated that she will consider
                a further direction in respect of this period, in particular in
                the light of any indications she may receive as to the wishes of
                the Assembly after it has begun to meet.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the last sitting, several matters were
                raised with me on which I was asked to give a ruling and on
                which I offered to conduct investigation. The first, raised by
                Mr&nbsp;O’Connor, a Member for East Antrim, was about entry to
                the Chamber by Members during the conduct of a vote. On a
                related point, Mr&nbsp;Ian&nbsp;Paisley&nbsp;Jnr asked about the
                authority to have the doors locked.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have investigated these matters. ‘Erskine&nbsp;May’
                cites the precedent of Members being specifically identified in
                connection with entering a Division Lobby after the order has
                been given to lock the doors. I believe that this precedent is
                relevant. I therefore rule as follows.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr&nbsp;Ian&nbsp;Paisley and
                Mr&nbsp;Paisley&nbsp;Jnr entered the Chamber, according to the
                timed video tape, fully 60&nbsp;seconds after the order for the
                doors to be closed had been given, and after a number of Members
                had voted. Both this and the leaving of the Chamber by any
                Member prior to the Doorkeepers’ reopening the Doors is
                improper.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Under Initial Standing Order&nbsp;2(1), it is
                within the Speaker’s powers to instruct that the doors be
                secured during a Division. To do otherwise would be to
                disadvantage Members whose names occur early in the alphabetical
                list.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is not permissible to vote from the
                Galleries, nor will it be permissible to vote in the Division
                Lobbies until the Assembly decides, under Standing Orders, that
                they can be used for that purpose, at which time they will
                become the proper places to vote. In this situation, however, it
                is quite clear that the Members entered the Division Lobby after
                the doors had been closed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In view of the fact that Dr&nbsp;Paisley was
                aware of the procedure of the closing of the doors, as is clear
                from his intervention, recorded on videotape and timed at
                5.15&nbsp;pm, at the sitting on 15&nbsp;December&nbsp;1998, and
                since other Members who held the rules were unable to have their
                votes recorded on a previous occasion, I rule that the record be
                amended to disallow the votes of Dr&nbsp;Paisley and
                Mr&nbsp;Paisley&nbsp;Jnr on that occasion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCartney raised the issue of getting
                advice from the Deputy Clerk. In particular, he enquired about
                whether it would be advisable to leave the Chamber. Having
                investigated the exchanges, I am content that the Deputy Clerk
                acted properly on that occasion.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Initial Presiding
                Officer. Following the marvellous achievement of Ulster at
                Lansdowne&nbsp;Road at the weekend, is it in order for me to ask
                whether arrangements have been made for the Assembly to receive
                this great rugby team so that we may all rejoice in their
                achievement of becoming European champions?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Initial Presiding Officer:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with Mr&nbsp;Kennedy, and I
                understand that some matters are in hand. But I am not sure that
                this is a point of order.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Initial Presiding
                Officer. I ask you to reflect further on the meaning and
                intention of Standing Order&nbsp;2(1), which you quoted in an
                earlier ruling. It is clear that your role is to interpret and
                enforce Standing Orders, but you do not have the power to make
                new Standing Orders. Quite properly, that power is withheld from
                you. No Standing Order suggests that the Doors should be closed
                or locked, and you have enforced existing Standing Orders in
                such a way as to attempt to extend them. I would like you to
                look at this matter again because it goes far beyond what the
                Standing Orders entitle the Initial Presiding Officer to do.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Initial Presiding Officer:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On almost every occasion when requested by
                Members to review a matter I have done so. I will do so again on
                this occasion. However, I should draw the Assembly’s attention
                to two matters.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, I have repeatedly said that the
                Initial Standing Orders are not adequate for the conduct of the
                Assembly’s business and that, therefore, I should take other
                matters into account. Those matters include the draft Standing
                Orders, the discussions on them, and ‘Erskine&nbsp;May’. I
                have made that clear on a number of occasions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, on the issue of fastening the doors
                — not locking them — I have not given instructions that they
                must be locked, although that is the procedure in other places
                when Members do not accept that the doors should simply be
                closed. If the doors were not closed our procedure would be
                improper because advantage would be given to Members whose names
                came later in alphabetical order, and that could lead to
                discrimination.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will look again at the matter, and if I
                have made a judgement which has gone beyond what is appropriate
                I will draw that to the attention of the Assembly.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Paisley Jnr:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Presiding Officer.
                Will you please provide Members with a list of what you believe
                is proper and what is not proper. It is extremely difficult for
                Members to operate properly when they do not know exactly what,
                in your terms, is proper and what is not proper. According to
                Standing Order&nbsp;2(2), you have no right to disallow our
                votes or to remove us from the Chamber. You have no right to
                tell us when we may or may not enter the Chamber. For those
                reasons, we need a list of what, in your mind, is proper and
                what is improper.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Initial Presiding Officer:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have already given that list. The matter to
                which I refer is clearly dealt with in ‘Erskine&nbsp;May’,
                and that was followed in the ruling given.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Paisley Jnr:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Further to that point of order, Mr Initial
                Presiding Officer. Will you give the precise paragraph in ‘Erskine&nbsp;May’
                which says that doors have to be locked.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Initial Presiding Officer:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not clear about the purpose of the point
                of order since, as I have already said, my instruction was not
                that the doors be locked but merely that they be closed.
                However, I am content to state the section of ‘Erskine&nbsp;May’
                on which I based the ruling on what happens when Members are
                named as having entered the Division Lobbies after the doors
                have been locked and the procedure to be followed when it makes
                no difference to the outcome of the vote. I think that the
                reference is on page&nbsp;354. I will advise Members if that is
                incorrect.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Paisley Jnr:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Do you not accept that on all these matters
                ‘Erskine&nbsp;May’ is not specific but general?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Initial Officer:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member must consult ‘Erskine&nbsp;May’.
                On this matter it is not general but highly specific.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr Ian Paisley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Further to that point of order, Mr Initial
                Presiding Officer. I do not understand. In ‘Erskine&nbsp;May’
                there is a clear statement about the locking of doors. Anyone
                who understands what happens in the Mother of Parliaments knows
                that the Chamber is never locked against Members at voting time.
                Sometimes the Lobby doors are locked, but not the Chamber.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You have been taking guidance from ‘Erskine&nbsp;May’.
                It covers the locking of doors, but you have said that you asked
                for the doors to be shut, not locked. Therefore your ruling,
                based on ‘Erskine&nbsp;May’, is not applicable in these
                circumstances.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How can you make a new Standing Order about
                voting? You must rule on the basis of the Standing Orders made
                by the Secretary of State. She alone has the power to make
                Standing Orders at this time. Your ruling on the issue of voting
                has not interpreted a Standing Order; it has made a new Standing
                Order — something that you have no power to do.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Initial Presiding Officer:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member is suggesting that it is
                appropriate for Members to vote at any time and in any manner
                they choose. That is not proper.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The timed videotape shows that the two
                Members entered the Chamber after the other Members had begun to
                vote. At the last sitting it was suggested that the Members had
                been in the Division Lobby at the time. From my investigations
                it is clear that that is not the case.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I must give rulings to keep things in order.
                From the first sitting of the Assembly I have made it clear that
                the Initial Standing Orders are not sufficient for the proper
                maintenance of order, and there has been no dissent. I made it
                clear that I would refer to ‘Erskine&nbsp;May’, and there
                was no dissent. I said that I would call for the doors to be
                fastened, and there was no dissent. Indeed, Dr&nbsp;Paisley rose
                at 5.15&nbsp;pm on 15&nbsp;December to point out that the doors
                were locked. In fact, they were simply closed. However, he was
                right in saying that they should have been opened after the vote
                was taken. He was correct, but he made no objection to the fact
                that they were closed at that stage. I assume that if that had
                been a matter for legitimate objection, objection would have
                been made. Of course, there are aspects of ‘Erskine&nbsp;May’
                that are not applicable — this being a different type of
                Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not claim always to get it right, but
                Members must be aware that it is not possible for every matter
                to be conducted properly on the basis of the Initial Standing
                Orders. I have taken a reasonable number of objections and
                points of order on this matter, and I should now proceed to the
                third item on the Order Paper.</p>

                had behaved correctly. Can you give Members more information
                about this? Mr&nbsp;McCartney’s comments on that occasion, and
                his report of the conversation that he had with the Deputy

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have looked into the matter in respect of
                Mr&nbsp;McCartney’s comments and have received from the Deputy
                Clerk a written account of what was said. I have also received a
                letter from the Chief Whip of the Ulster Unionist Party and have
                responded to it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">From my enquiries I believe that matters were
                conducted properly. There was a clear dispute: some Members
                claimed that the Deputy Clerk should have said more, while
                others feared that he might have said too much. Such was the
                dilemma that the Deputy Clerk found himself in, and, from what I
                have ascertained, I am satisfied that the matter was conducted
                properly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, if Members feel that there are
                matters which have not been drawn to my attention, but ought to
                be, they should advise me accordingly. If other material comes
                to hand I will treat it seriously.</p>

                do not think it satisfactory to leave the previous debate as it
                stands. Mr&nbsp;Robinson and Mr&nbsp;Paisley implied or stated
                that your authority is limited to an interpretation of the
                present Standing Orders. Standing Order&nbsp;2(1) states</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The Presiding Officer’s ruling shall

                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That clearly indicates that, with regard to
                practical arrangements for the business of the House, your
                authority goes beyond these Standing Orders.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member puts it very clearly and, I think,
                properly. It is impossible to conduct matters solely on the
                basis of an interpretation of the rather thin Initial Standing
                Orders. The Assembly is aware of that. I drew this to Members’
                attention on the first day and have drawn it to their attention
                on virtually every other day since. There has been no dissent
                until now, when Members find themselves on the wrong side of a
                ruling.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The purpose of Standing Order&nbsp;2(1) is to

                to make it clear that I do not withdraw in any way the remarks
                that I made in relation to the information which I received from
                the Deputy Clerk.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to underline the fact that those
                remarks were intended not to indicate any imputation against the
                Deputy Clerk, but merely to establish that the Deputy Clerk was
                privy, as you were, to information about the intention of some
                parties to move the closure. Your reaction to that knowledge,
                which I believe you had, is the issue that is to be the subject
                of the first debate today. The matter which Mr&nbsp;Trimble
                raised can be more than adequately dealt with then.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The point that I was making, as will be clear
                to Members familiar with the rules of evidence, is that it
                seemed that the Deputy Clerk was privy to something that was
                going to occur and, by implication, that you were privy to it.</p>

                relates to a ruling on the Standing Orders. For you to make up
                procedure under no auspices whatsoever is ridiculous. You can
                only rule on the basis of what is in the Standing Orders.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You said earlier how terrible it would be if
                we were all to vote on the call of our names. That happens in
                the European Parliament when a President is elected. Members
                stay out of the Chamber until their names are called. Surely the
                Assembly should be capable of following the procedure of the
                great European experiment, which Members opposite laud to the

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In every such deliberative body it is normal

                suggested at any time that the Deputy Clerk breached any
                confidence. However, he was clearly placed in a difficult
                position because he was being asked a question which would have
                meant his breaching a confidence if he responded positively. He

                such a proposal would have to follow a motion being tabled and
                appearing on the Order Paper at least one day in advance of a
                plenary session. That has not yet happened, nor has the

                two days and, if necessary, a third. It was his decision, made
                in view of the importance of the subject matter and of the
                number of Members who wished to participate.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The whole point about CAPO is that it is a
                Committee to advise the Presiding Officer who takes decisions on
                these matters. His decision is recorded in the minutes.
                Furthermore, it is then his responsibility, under law, for the
                Initial Presiding Officer to publish a business diary, giving to
                Members in advance, information about what the business of the
                House will be.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The business diary for that week clearly
                shows a plenary session for Monday 18&nbsp;January&nbsp;1999 and
                Tuesday 19&nbsp;January&nbsp;1999, and a plenary session for
                Wednesday 20&nbsp;January&nbsp;1999, if required. There was no
                doubt that there was to be a full two-day debate and, if
                required, a third day on Wednesday 20&nbsp;January&nbsp;1999.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Order Paper was issued on the day of the
                debate. It set out Monday 18&nbsp;January&nbsp;1999, Tuesday
                19&nbsp;January&nbsp;1999 and Wednesday
                20&nbsp;January&nbsp;1999 as sitting days. There could be no
                doubt in the mind of the Initial Presiding Officer about what
                was reasonable and right in terms of the length of time for the
                debate. The Business Committee — or CAPO, as it is called —
                took cognizance of the fact that this was a crucial debate on a
                very important subject — and this was recognised by all of the
                parties — and, therefore, that it needed the additional day or
                two.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All parties were represented at the meeting
                of the Committee to Advise the Presiding Officer, and not one
                Member objected to a two- or three-day debate. Nor did any
                Member move that the debate be shortened in any way. There was
                no indication that the period allocated for this debate was too
                long, and the decisions that were taken clearly come from the
                advice given to the Initial Presiding Officer by all of the
                parties.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The debate, quite obviously, took fairly
                predictable lines. It was a normal Assembly debate — not even
                the references to hijackers and aeroplanes were particularly
                unusual. However, I listened to the revisionists trying to
                explain why it was proper to curtail the debate. Some of them
                said it was petering out: that is absolute nonsense. When the
                curtailing motion was brought forward, at least a dozen Members
                had yet to speak. Some Members arrogantly suggested that it be
                curtailed after they had spoken, since from then — for them
                — everything was downhill, and nothing further needed to be
                said. However, the reality was that there was plenty of steam
                left in the debate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Then some of the revisionists suggested that
                there had been repetition. One of them had the audacity to quote
                my colleague Jim&nbsp;Wells who raised matters that nobody else
                had. There is nothing wrong with repetition, providing that it
                is not the same person repeating himself, and that seems to have
                been forgotten. There was no repetition; under the Standing
                Orders, it is the Initial Presiding Officer’s responsibility
                to draw to a Member’s attention the fact that he is repeating
                his remarks tediously and ask him to resume his seat, but there
                is nothing to stop one Member from covering the same points that
                another has dealt with.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was also suggested that the debate was not
                the one that was expected. I am not sure what some Members did
                expect, but the subject matter was clear, and it had not
                changed. There may have been some delay in terms of one element
                of the overall report, but that would have been something more
                rather than less to debate. The debate had not reached the
                halfway stage when the Ulster Unionist Chief Whip rose to move
                the closure motion.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Robinson stated that the debate had not
                reached the halfway stage, but in his earlier remarks he said
                that there were at least 12&nbsp;speakers to be called. I
                understand that&nbsp;30 Members had already been called, so can
                he please explain by what quirk of mathematics he thinks the
                debate was less than halfway through?</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For the benefit of this intellectual
                colossus, my statement was based upon what I knew to be the
                position with regard to the number of DUP Members still to
                speak. I would not presume to guess the number that other
                parties would have been putting forward, but it would have been
                remarkable if the DUP had been allowed to have 12&nbsp;speakers
                without any other party making some comments. It is clear that
                if some Members do not like what is being said, they stop it
                being said. That is some democracy for this House to enjoy!</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to examine the decision that was
                taken, and, incidentally, I do not fault the Chief Whip of the
                Ulster Unionist Party for rising to attempt a closure motion.
                The Standing Orders provide for that — within certain
                limitations — and in terms of those, what he did was fairly
                acceptable. However, as far as the meeting of the Committee to
                Advise the Presiding Officer was concerned, he was breaking his
                word, because at that meeting it had been indicated that there
                would be a two- or three-day debate.</p>

                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;After a motion has been proposed and
                provided that each of the parties present has had a reasonable
                opportunity to contribute to the debate, any member who has not
                already spoken to it, or to any amendment which has been moved,
                may move that the question be now put.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That, as I said, is the part of the Standing
                Order which perfectly entitled the Chief Whip of the Ulster
                Unionist Party to stand.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But there is a protection in the latter part
                of paragraph 11(1):</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;and unless it shall appear to the
                Presiding Officer that such motion is an abuse of these Standing
                Orders, the question that the question be now put shall be put
                forthwith, and decided without amendment or debate.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The wording of the Standing Order is not
                accidental. It was not the original thought of the Secretary of
                State or her advisors; it comes directly from the House of
                Commons. It is the language of Westminster. When the Initial
                Presiding Officer, rightly and properly says that he uses ‘Erskine&nbsp;May’
                as a guide, then we have the right to look at ‘Erskine&nbsp;May’
                to see what guidance he would have found, had he looked there
                for advice.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are two main tomes of knowledge in
                respect of practice and procedure in the House of Commons. One
                — the most respected — is ‘Erskine&nbsp;May’. The other
                — perhaps lesser known — is Griffith and Ryle: ‘Parliament:
                Functions, Practice &amp; Procedures’. On the subject of
                closure Griffith and Ryle states</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The conditions attaching to the
                granting of the closure are important. Nothing is formally laid
                down, but the Chair, in whose sole, personal discretion it lies
                ……does seek to act within certain broad guidelines, based on
                previous practice and experience.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want Members to listen to this:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Here, practice and practical
                considerations are important.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And for those who do not know what the moment
                of interruption is, in terms of parliamentary language, it is
                usually at 10&nbsp;o’clock, but it is a moment when a vote is
                expected.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;For example, a closure will normally be
                granted just before the moment of interruption at the end of a
                full day’s debate on a substantive motion ... It would not
                normally be granted on such business, significantly earlier than
                the moment of interruption. These cases are easy.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Before I come to ‘Erskine&nbsp;May’ —
                which is quite revealing on this subject — it might be
                worthwhile to explain why there are closure motions. As with a
                great deal of parliamentary practice, the House of Commons was
                forced to adopt closure motions because of disruption from
                nationalists. In the early part of this century — and, indeed,
                the latter part of the last — nationalists attempted to
                disrupt the proceedings of the House of Commons. They tried to
                prolong debate, to stop decisions from being taken. And those
                who are in the House of Commons know that if a Member speaks
                beyond his time, he can stop a vote from being taken.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nationalists use these tactical procedures in
                order to disrupt parliamentary sessions, prevent decisions from
                being made and prolong debate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A closure is not a mechanism to cut short a
                debate; it is a mechanism to stop a debate from being prolonged.
                That distinction must be made if anybody is to understand how a
                closure operates. That was the mistake — and I put it in those
                terms at the moment — made by the Initial Presiding Officer.
                He read the Standing Order in such a way that the closure motion
                was one that could cut short a debate. It never has been. It has
                always been a mechanism to ensure that the proper proceedings of
                Parliament could be held and not disrupted.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What does ‘Erskine&nbsp;May’ say about
                this? The chapter on methods of curtailing debate states</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;All these methods were originally
                designed to counteract ... prolonging debate, and so obstructing
                the progress of business. They are probably a permanent feature
                of modern procedure, but they are still felt to be an
                unfortunate necessity and not to be justified except against
                obstruction or by pressure of business.&quot;</p>

                minority are protected by the discretionary power, given to the

                motion. The critical words in ‘Erskine&nbsp;May’ are</p>

                obstruction or by pressure of business&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Consider those two exceptions. The Initial
                Presiding Officer had indicated the length of time allocated to
                the debate. It was no obstruction for the debate to take its
                full course. The only obstruction was the move for closure. That
                was the abuse of Standing Orders, not continuing the debate
                according to the time scheduled.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hardly need to address the subject of
                &quot;pressure of business&quot;. Not even the bravest Member
                would dare to suggest that this Assembly has been under such
                time pressure that it had to move on to some other pressing
                matter. We have only met half a dozen times in six months; there
                was clearly no pressure of business, there was no other
                substantive motion to be debated and there was plenty of time to
                finish the debate. According to ‘Erskine&nbsp;May’ and to
                Griffith and Ryle, it is abundantly clear that the Initial
                Presiding Officer was wrong.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I described these circumstances to the Clerks
                at Westminster, without telling them where the matter had
                occurred, and asked what the Speaker would do. It was made
                absolutely clear to me that the Speaker would not have allowed
                the closure motion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The consequences of the Initial Presiding
                Officer’s ruling were many. Parties had marshalled their
                troops for a two- or three-day debate, not just in terms of
                attendance but also by selecting their speakers and the order of
                speaking. To facilitate a balanced debate — and I suspect
                other parties who were unaware of the tactics of the Ulster
                Unionist Party may have done the same — this party had spread
                its key speakers for a two-day debate. We had slotted in several
                Members for their maiden speeches, which they were denied the
                opportunity to make.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Perhaps the greatest consequence was that
                this party at least had decided to divide responsibility for
                certain subjects over the two days. Contrary to the argument
                that there would have been repetition, later speeches would have
                dealt with the unnatural divisions involved in the creation of
                10&nbsp;Departments — Education divided in two, the cutting up
                of the Department of the Environment and housing going to Social
                Development. There are many artificial creations, and that would
                have been the subject of consideration.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The cost and danger of creating ten
                Departments is clearly a matter of some interest. Certainly it
                should be of interest to Ulster Unionists. I notice that
                Jim&nbsp;Nicholson, the Ulster Unionist MEP, found it incredible
                that ten Departments had been proposed, with an overall cost of
                £90&nbsp;million. Mr&nbsp;Nicholson said</p>

                In the past I have had to rise to criticize the Initial
                Presiding Officer, in particular, on the occasion when
                Mr&nbsp;Berry made a reference to the Loughgall incident: he, in
                fact, called for more Loughgalls. I had to draw the Initial
                Presiding Officer’s attention to the fact that this remark was
                disgraceful. Mr&nbsp;Berry was calling for further murders. <i>[Interruption]</i>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is great to get a parliamentary lesson
                from the Rev&nbsp;Ian&nbsp;Paisley.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am speaking to the motion of no confidence.
                I have previously raised objections to the manner in which the
                Initial Presiding Officer has conducted business here. There was
                one very serious incident during which I considered that he was
                in breach of his responsibilities — the incident in which
                Mr&nbsp;Berry referred to wanting more Loughgalls, more murders,
                by the British forces.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">From my party’s point of view, the conduct
                in this Chamber has never been perfect, to say the least.
                However, Sinn Féin is opposed to this motion because it has
                more to do with political gimmickry and is a waste of people’s
                time. Those who voted for or, indeed, against the agreement,
                find it strange that parties can only find time to discuss a
                motion of no confidence in the Presiding Officer, who may not
                hold that position beyond 10&nbsp;March. We have more important
                things to do than that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the matter of the guillotine motion, the
                DUP appears to be very smug about its ability to make best use
                of Standing Orders in many councils across the North. Its
                confidence does it credit.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To suggest that there cannot be a guillotine
                motion after 30 or so Members have spoken in a debate is a bit
                of a red herring. As a member of CAPO I certainly agreed to
                having two days and possibly a third day for a vote if that was
                necessary, but that was not binding on any of the parties. We
                supported the guillotine motion because in our view the matter
                had been well aired.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Initial comments and the conduct in that
                debate show that the DUP, the UKUP and other parties had several
                points of order which lasted for some considerable time. To have
                an additional 12&nbsp;Members speaking after all the other
                contributions had been made would have been completely
                unnecessary. All parties had ample opportunity to express their
                views on the report tabled by the First Minister (Designate) and
                the Deputy First Minister (Designate). We supported the
                guillotine motion not because we wanted to hinder the DUP — it
                may appear on television every day of the week for the high
                propaganda value it gets from that — but because we were sure
                that all parties had had ample opportunity to air their views on
                the report.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The general public watch the antics of DUP
                Members and of Mr McCartney, who is the other expert at
                tomfoolery in the Chamber.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have no interest in guillotining the
                debate to prevent any party airing its views. We made sure we
                were satisfied that all parties had ample opportunity to express
                their views on the report. The debate is a waste of time and
                energy. It is political tomfoolery, and the public will make
                their own judgement on that. We have criticised the Initial
                Presiding Officer in the past and no doubt we may do so in
                future but overall, he has conducted the Assembly’s affairs
                satisfactorily, and we therefore oppose the motion.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Neeson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the risk of repeating the words of a DUP
                Member earlier in the debate, I do not intend to say much in
                this charade. The debate should have been curtailed. For the
                DUP, it was not a question of debating the report by the First
                Minister (Designate) and the Deputy First Minister (Designate)
                but of having a go at the Ulster Unionists on the whole question
                of decommissioning. Most of what DUP Members said had nothing to
                do with the report.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Robinson chose today to deal with issues
                in the report that should have been dealt with in the debate on
                that report. I regret that we are not debating the issue of
                Assembly staff being abused and bullied at the Doors by some DUP
                Members. Having raised this issue, will I also be threatened
                with legal proceedings in the way other Members have been
                threatened?</p>

                said that this is a democratic, parliamentary Assembly. I

                in the Assembly.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a member of the Committee to Advise the
                Presiding Officer, I concur with Mr&nbsp;Robinson’s comments.
                As Members are aware, after a period of deliberation and debate,
                the Committee expresses the unanimous view of all the parties
                that are represented on it, and the Presiding Officer considers
                our advice. He then determines how business is presented to the
                House and the manner in which it is conducted.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.30 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is clear, as the record shows, that the
                parties indicated to the Initial Presiding Officer that a
                reasonable amount of time was needed to debate the matter fully
                — one of the major debates that we have had in the House so
                far.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Having considered the views of all members of
                the Committee, the Initial Presiding Officer concluded that the
                debate on the Report from the First Minister (Designate) and the
                Deputy First Minister (Designate) should last for two, and
                possibly three, days.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Regrettably, the Initial Presiding Officer,
                having reached that conclusion, subsequently agreed to a closure
                motion to cut the debate short. The manner in which the debate
                was brought to a close was particularly distasteful to
                anti-agreement Members. They believed that the Report from the
                First Minister (Designate) and the Deputy First Minister
                (Designate) was a serious matter, one which will have
                ramifications, not only for this Chamber and those involved in
                the political process, but for the wider community in Northern
                Ireland for many years to come.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Initial Presiding Officer was wrong to
                close the debate at that time. In his opening comments today he
                acknowledged that he does not always get it right, and I believe
                that that was one occasion when he did not get it right.
                Although the Initial Presiding Officer has performed the duties
                of the Chair to the satisfaction of the Assembly, on this
                occasion, he made a serious error of judgement. Shortening the
                debate prevented Members from having enough time to discuss
                these matters fully. It was clear that the thrust towards
                shortening the debate came from the Ulster Unionist Party. We
                all know why the Ulster Unionist Party wanted to shorten the
                debate. It was not because they felt that Members had had a fair
                opportunity to express their opinions, and it was not because
                they felt that the debate had become repetitive.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I believe that I am firmly on target in
                relation to this subject. The fact that Mr&nbsp;Birnie has risen
                indicates that I have hit the bull’s-eye.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion was guillotined because the Ulster
                Unionist Party felt gravely uneasy about Members in their ranks
                who were having a very difficult day — they did not want to
                have to go through another day during which these Members would
                question the party’s line.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Northern Ireland Unionist Party hopes
                that the Initial Presiding Officer will recognise that he did
                err in this case. It is hoped that we will not witness such a
                spectacle in the future. Procedures such as guillotine motions,
                when used to stifle debate, do nothing for the reputation of
                this House.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have heard, since the inception of the
                peace process, during the negotiations at Castle&nbsp;Buildings
                and now in the Assembly, about its being an inclusive process.
                It appears that it is only inclusive, and Members can only fully
                ventilate their views, if they are in favour of the Belfast
                Agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we wish to oppose the Belfast Agreement,
                we are told by Members such as Sean&nbsp;Neeson that we are not
                democrats. Mr&nbsp;Neeson has the effrontery to question the
                relevancy of comments made by other parties. That has never
                stopped Mr&nbsp;Neeson getting to his feet.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is not the business of this House, Madam
                Acting Presiding Officer, to determine whether Members feel that
                the issues being raised by parties are relevant or repetitive.
                If that is the criteria, then many of the debates would be much
                shorter. I hope that this tactic will not be used to stifle
                debate in the future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Robinson has explained that this
                tactic would not be considered normal procedure in any other
                debating chamber. I hope that in future the good name of this
                House will not be sullied by Members using procedural matters to
                stifle debate.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Madam Deputy Initial Presiding Officer
                (Designate) — perhaps I could simply refer to you as Madam
                Speaker or Madam Deputy Speaker — the debate of
                18&nbsp;January was by far the most important debate that we
                have had in the Assembly. The future governance of
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland centred on it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members were aware that it had been agreed
                that the report formed the essence of the determination to be
                made on 15&nbsp;February, upon which the future transfer of
                substantive powers would depend. It was therefore a debate of
                grave, constitutional importance for all the people of
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland, no matter their views. That was
                recognised in the meeting of the Committee to Advise the
                Presiding Officer when it was agreed that there should be a two-
                or possibly three-day debate. To suggest that this debate today
                is some form of vaudeville act or political mimicry is just
                nonsense.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This debate is about the cutting short of one
                of the most important and essential debates that we are likely
                to undertake in this Chamber. That is its importance.
                Mr&nbsp;Robinson makes a number of very valid points about
                parliamentary procedure, insofar as that is a guide.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The purpose of a closure motion is not to cut
                short a debate but to prevent the unnecessary prolongation of a
                debate for the purpose of obstruction. Where the prolongation of
                that debate would cause obstruction or prevent other pressing
                business from being attended to, the Speaker has discretion to
                take the necessary course if a closure motion is put. That was
                never the position that faced the Initial Presiding Officer when
                this was proposed. Indeed, we can presume that he was aware some
                time before that this closure motion was going to be put.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to address very briefly the matter of
                my remarks about the Deputy Clerk. The Deputy Clerk and I have
                always had a relationship based not only on respect but also on
                a good deal of friendliness. I sought his advice because I had
                no knowledge that he knew, and that the Speaker knew, that there
                would be a closure motion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I inadvertently put him in the embarrassing
                position of having to choose between telling the truth — to
                admit to me that it would be wrong to leave the Assembly because
                a motion could be pressed at any moment — and betraying the
                confidence of the Initial Presiding Officer. I was unaware that
                he was placed in that position and, in the circumstances,
                acknowledge that he endeavoured to be honourable and to preserve
                the confidentiality that is required of him. I was unaware of
                his difficulty, and, with the benefit of hindsight, if any of my
                remarks could be remotely interpreted as importuning his good
                name or his integrity, of course they are withdrawn.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">From the record it is quite clear that that
                was never the case. I was simply indicating that by his answer,
                which was the only one he could give in the circumstances, he
                clearly indicated a degree of knowledge about a possible closure
                motion on the part of the Initial Presiding Officer.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The question arises whether it was
                appropriate for the Initial Presiding Officer to accept the
                closure motion and, in my submission, it was not appropriate at
                that time. In any event, the Initial Presiding Officer was aware
                that many Members were under the impression that there had been
                an agreement at the meeting of the Committee to Advise the
                Presiding Officer for a two-day or possibly a three-day debate,
                and Members who wished to speak were apportioned accordingly.
                The Initial Presiding Officer knew that that impression had been
                given by the CAPO agreement and by the order of business.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several options were open to him. He could
                have said at some stage, or in response to Mr&nbsp;Wilson’s
                motion, that 30&nbsp;Members had spoken and, although others had
                yet to speak, we were approaching the time when a closure motion
                might be accepted. Alternatively, he could have left it until
                the end of the first day and advised Mr&nbsp;Wilson that,
                although the moment for a closure was not yet appropriate, it
                was approaching. Everyone would have been alerted, and he would
                have been acting entirely within the rules of the procedure and
                precedence that are laid down in ‘Erskine&nbsp;May’ and in
                other books.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is for the Assembly to decide whether it
                is nonsense. Sedentary remarks are usually not worth much.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will vote against the motion because I
                believe that, to date, the Initial Presiding Officer has
                demonstrated great qualities. It is generally recognised that he
                has endeavoured to be fair to everyone, and he has dealt with
                the business with intelligence, good humour and understanding.
                However, that does not remove the fact that on this occasion he
                was wrong in terms of procedure and precedent in accepting the
                closure motion. Knowing that many were under the impression that
                the debate would go on for two days, he was wrong to curtail it.
                He must have been aware that many Members held strong views on
                the Belfast Agreement.</p>
                <i>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They had a desire to be heard. Justice is not
                just about winning a case; it is also about having an
                opportunity to speak and to put the case. Everyone knows that
                ultimately — since this was not taken as a vote requiring
                cross-community support — it would almost inevitably have been
                carried. Therefore there was no loss to anyone. There was
                certainly no loss to the Ulster Unionist Party or to the SDLP in
                letting this debate run its course by allowing everyone to be
                heard. At the end of the day they were going to succeed in
                having it carried.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So what purpose was served by the Presiding
                Officer’s accepting the closure motion? No purpose was served.
                People were denied the right to speak, people were obstructed
                from airing views on matters that meant a great deal to them. I
                therefore believe that the behaviour of the Presiding Officer on
                that occasion was totally wrong. He was complicit with the
                Ulster Unionist Party in accepting a procedural motion that had
                no merit, no justice and no place in public or political
                morality, a motion which should have been refused.</p>

                regulation of the House, and its order of business, is the slim
                little tome — or perhaps I should say tomb. It is certainly a
                very grave matter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;This is all we have&quot; they said.
                Dr&nbsp;Paisley spoke at length about procedure in the European
                Parliament and the Mother of Parliaments, as he calls it, and
                Mr&nbsp;Robinson also quoted from ‘Erskine&nbsp;May’ in
                support of their case. And what is their case, Madam Chair?
                Their case is that such precedence and guidance have no bearing
                here. How much more absurd can you get than that? There is no
                case to answer here.</p>

                the debate. The debate is on whether we should have confidence
                in the Presiding Officer, and that is affected by whether he
                made a reasonable judgement on this occasion. Did this party
                have an opportunity to make an input into the debate. I am
                pointing out it did, and that it did not avail of it. I have
                listed the Members who made contributions — Mr&nbsp;Watson,
                Mr&nbsp;Carrick, Mr&nbsp;Boyd, Mr&nbsp;Roche. All those members
                of the anti-Agreement family had opportunities to speak,
                although they dealt almost exclusively with matters that were

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To argue that they did not get an opportunity
                to deal with the matter in question is clearly wrong and absurd
                especially in circumstances where almost none of what they had
                to say was relevant. I quote Initial Standing Order&nbsp;2(1):</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If I have any criticism of the Initial
                Presiding Officer it is that he showed a little too much
                indulgence to the codology, the guffawing, the sniggering, the
                catcalling, the schoolboy, schoolyard antics of the DUP and
                associated anti-agreement parties. They assert that this is a
                vital matter affecting everybody, but then rush to the door. The
                previous day Ulster was being sold out — a shameful betrayal
                — and they were behaving as though they were at the movies.
                There was laughter, guffawing and sniggering of a kind and
                duration that few of us have had the misfortune to see in the
                past.</p>

                rubric to be quoted word by word. Where do the rules give CAPO
                the right to determine and regulate the business of the House?
                CAPO’s role is to advise the Initial Presiding Officer, and
                that is clearly laid down in the regulations that established
                CAPO. Its decision to allocate two or three days to this debate
                was indicative — not imperative. Those who are shamming and
                crying that they did not get an opportunity to make their views
                known had that opportunity but did not bother to deal with the
                issue that was before the House. The Initial Presiding Officer’s
                ruling was entirely valid, appropriate, and intelligent, and I

                to be brought before the House. I welcome the opportunity to
                support the motion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On 18&nbsp;January, the Assembly was
                presented with the long-awaited report of the First Minister
                (Designate) and Deputy First Minister (Designate) on the future
                government of Northern Ireland. Its content was crucial to the
                whole community, and that was clearly identified by those who
                were responsible for formulating the business of the Assembly
                because two to three days were set aside for the debate. Having
                agreed the schedule at the outset, the Initial Presiding Officer
                was aware of the need to permit as much input as possible to the
                debate. He made a poor judgement in his decision to permit the
                Assembly to govern itself on this matter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the main selling points of the
                agreement was the fact that a 108-Member Assembly would be put
                in place to bring about devolved government in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland. Furthermore, it was agreed to increase
                the number of seats in each constituency from five to six — a
                change from previous decisions. That was to permit maximum
                representation from within our community, thus allowing the
                maximum contribution on behalf of our constituents.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For example, in relation to my constituency
                of East Antrim, if Mr&nbsp;Neeson had not been called in his
                capacity as leader of the Alliance Party, it is possible that no
                one from that area would have had the chance to express his
                views to the House, irrespective of whether he was pro or
                anti-agreement. That results in a serious under-representation
                of our communities and sends the wrong signals to the general
                public.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While the Initial Presiding Officer’s
                actions may have done a great disservice to many Members, he has
                also created a perception and a lack of confidence in the
                Assembly by the electorate. To many, it seems that when the
                going gets tough and the heat is on, the guillotine will be
                produced and the debate ambushed. That is the wrong message to
                send to the outside world. I have highlighted what the community
                expects in such circumstances, but there is also a need for
                equality within the House.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Standing Orders were quoted by my
                colleague Mr&nbsp;Robinson. They state that closure occurs after
                a motion has been proposed and provided that each of the parties
                present has had reasonable opportunity to contribute to the
                debate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Did the Initial Presiding Officer really deem
                this to be the case?</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.00</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On previous occasions many parties had
                between 40% and 50% of their Members speaking in the debate. On
                18&nbsp;January&nbsp;1999 the Democratic Unionist Party, the
                third largest group, had less than one third of its membership
                called despite the fact that all Members wished to speak. The
                Initial Presiding Officer had recognised this deficit on past
                occasions but failed, on 18&nbsp;January&nbsp;1999, to redress
                the matter and show equality.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After the community and the party, I as an
                individual, having been called by the Initial Presiding Officer,
                rose to speak but was ambushed and guillotined by the Initial
                Presiding Officer upholding the intervention of
                Mr&nbsp;J&nbsp;Wilson. If a Member has been called, his freedom
                of speech should be acknowledged, and any closure or putting of
                the question be put on hold. I have not yet received a
                satisfactory response to the question which I put to the Initial
                Presiding Officer on 18&nbsp;January&nbsp;1999.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the question of individual Members’
                participation, the issue must be raised as to why the Initial
                Presiding Officer determined a debate of two to three days,
                knowing the maximum time allocated to each Member and then,
                after five hours, allowed the debate to be closed. This
                indicates a serious misjudgement and clearly shows that a
                reasonable number of Members had not taken part in the debate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thirty Members may have contributed before
                the closure, but the time allocated would have allowed at least
                another 30&nbsp;participants. If it had not been for the
                misjudgement of the Initial Presiding Officer many Members like
                myself from grass-roots Unionist and Loyalist backgrounds would
                have been able to give our views on issues raised in the report
                such as departmental structures, cross-border bodies, executives
                and, of course, the D-word — decommissioning.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was, of course, the highlighting of the
                decommissioning issue which led to the unease among the Ulster
                Unionists, and despite assurances from the Deputy First Minister
                Designate that all would be listened to, both the Ulster
                Unionists and the SDLP contrived with others to force the
                Initial Presiding Officer to make a very poor decision.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While decommissioning was the word on most
                people’s lips on 18&nbsp;January&nbsp;1999, the D-word today
                is democracy. If democracy cannot be upheld through freedom of
                speech then the wheelbarrow Mr&nbsp;Close referred to can be
                loaded up with democracy, wheeled down the mile-long driveway
                and dumped outside the gates on the Upper&nbsp;Newtownards&nbsp;Road.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I once again commend the motion in the hope
                that, in future, such blatant acts of denial of freedom of
                speech are ended and reasonable opportunities are afforded to
                constitutional parties and individuals who adhere to the
                democratic process.</p>

                the point he raised: the interruption of his speech by

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our Initial Presiding Officer has had
                difficulties. It has often been said in the Chamber that this is
                not Westminster. Nor is it the Forum, which existed for two
                years before the Assembly. There seems to be much confusion
                about the Assembly’s procedures. The Initial Presiding Officer
                has tried to interpret the Initial Standing Orders, and he has
                often made the point that he would like the Standing Orders
                Committee to provide him with final Standing Orders that could
                be approved by the Secretary of State. Until such time, he must
                follow the Initial Standing Orders.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee to Advise the Presiding Officer
                is exactly that. It is a committee that advises; it is not a
                committee that rules. The final authority rests with the House.
                In allowing the closure motion on 18&nbsp;January, the Initial
                Presiding Officer was asking Members whether they wanted the
                Question to be put then. Seventy-five Members said
                &quot;Aye&quot; and 24&nbsp;Members said &quot;No&quot;. In
                other words, the Chamber ruled that we move to close the debate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The record of proceedings of 18&nbsp;January
                shows that we asked the Initial Presiding Officer to close the
                proceedings earlier than the Wednesday morning, which, according
                to Mr&nbsp;Robinson, was when the debate should have closed.
                However, page&nbsp;466 of Hansard quotes
                Mr&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;Robinson as saying that if it was possible to
                close by Tuesday night, the Initial Presiding Officer could do
                so. That shows, therefore, that we have already given the
                Initial Presiding Officer authority to close a debate earlier
                than was agreed in the Committee to Advise the Presiding
                Officer. However, the Initial Presiding Officer chose to ask the
                Assembly if the Question that would close the debate should be
                put.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should, therefore, vote against today’s
                motion and show confidence in the Initial Presiding Officer. He
                had no alternative to putting the procedural Question on that
                occasion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">From time to time, Members may not like the
                rulings of the Initial Presiding Officer, and there have been
                occasions when we have asked him to rule, in consultation with
                ‘Erskine&nbsp;May’, on whether some of the language and
                behaviour in this Chamber has been discourteous or
                unparliamentary.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have heard rulings which may not please
                every Member, but if this Chamber is to operate, it must accept
                them. We may be unhappy with them but we must work to ensure
                that proceedings in this Chamber are not discourteous.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It does not help the Chamber, in its early
                days, that a vote of no confidence in the Initial Presiding
                Officer is sought. This is more a quarrel about the fact that
                some Members did not get to speak on that occasion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Initial Presiding Officer has had to take
                account of the number of Members present and of the mandate of
                parties and make rulings on who should speak and who should not.
                Some Members have been displeased when debates have been closed,
                and not all have been able to put their positions. The Initial
                Presiding Officer might not get it right all the time, but I
                think that he has got it right most of the time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I oppose the motion of no confidence in the
                Initial Presiding Officer.</p>

                that the Question be now put, he did so knowing that he was
                breaking his word and a commitment already given. He found
                plenty of allies in his new-found friends in the SDLP and Sinn
                Féin/IRA. By so doing he has put future decisions of CAPO under
                the spotlight.</p>

                want to draw the attention of the House to what was being
                debated on the day the guillotine was operated on Mr&nbsp;Wilson’s
                initiative. It was, of course, a report produced by a so-called
                Unionist Mr&nbsp;Trimble and by a strident Nationalist Mr&nbsp;Mallon.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is significant that a debate on that
                report — a report which was supposed to have far-reaching
                effects on the future of this country — was guillotined and
                that I and others were not allowed the time to speak. My view
                was that the report was not only rotten from the core but rotten
                to the core. I should have been allowed to give my observations
                on it, but I was prevented from doing so by those who see
                expediency as being the order of the day. It ill behoves those
                who behave in such a manner — stealing cheap points — but
                maybe it is better to have something like this happen early on

                permit Members of the House to speak on that day even though
                they had already submitted their names? I conclude that he was
                wrong and that on this occasion he looked around and, under the
                pressure coming from the two largest political blocks, he wilted
                and decided to put the procedural Question. Everybody in the
                Assembly has a right to speak, but the Initial Presiding Officer
                was pushed by Mr&nbsp;J Wilson and others.</p>

                better crack of the whip. Mr Trimble had problems that day, and

                today shows, sadly, that many Members feel that he has not done

                Sinn Féin. In January 1999 Members were asked to approve a

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Every paragraph in my speech contains a
                reference to the motion. What did the Ulster Unionists achieve
                by voting with Sinn Féin in an ambush against their fellow
                Ulster citizens? Our refusal to acquiesce in approving Sinn
                Féin’s entrance into government has caused a political
                impasse. Accepting armed terrorists in an Executive is morally
                wrong. Token gestures of Semtex and other explosives will not
                suffice. Not to debate the report in full was also morally
                wrong.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No amount of smart moves, shady dealings or
                strokes to stifle debate, with or without the help of the
                Initial Presiding Officer, can hide the emerging voting pattern
                involving Sinn Féin and the Ulster Unionist in a coalition. Why
                have a debate at all? I put to David&nbsp;Trimble the question
                that he posed to the Secretary of State, Mo Mowlam, in
                September&nbsp;1997: how can anyone justify bringing to the
                table of democracy those who have been responsible for murder
                and other iniquitous crimes for which they have not paid their
                debt to society? By their actions, David&nbsp;Trimble and his
                negotiating team have done exactly that. These people will not
                now be brought to justice. David Trimble has secured a virtual
                amnesty for IRA and INLA murderers and bombers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1997 David&nbsp;Trimble told the people
                &quot;We are here not to talk to Sinn Féin but to confront them
                and expose their Fascist character.&quot; However, on every
                occasion in 1998 and 1999 the Ulster Unionist Party has voted
                with Sinn Féin/IRA — its friends in the Assembly. Not even a
                fool would call that confrontational. Instead, the Ulster
                Unionist Party has bestowed on IRA/Sinn Féin a worldwide
                credibility usually reserved for statesmen. It regularly meets
                privately with Gerry&nbsp;Adams.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In approving the January report, one must ask
                if this will provide an opportunity for Sinn Féin to get into
                government? For my colleagues and me the risk is too great. It
                would be like giving a seal of approval to Sinn Féin/IRA and
                any Government that they are accepted in while they maintain
                their armed capability. The cutting short of the debate was a
                great disservice to those who elected us, but it exposed the
                togetherness of Sinn&nbsp;Féin/IRA and the Ulster Unionist
                Party.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Obviously the Ulster Unionist Party feels
                that this is not the case. They guillotined the anti-Agreement
                Members, but at what price? Despite the ambush, our heads are
                still on. There was much confusion among the Unionist Assembly
                Members about the ramifications of voting on the report. Did the
                fear of what they were voting for forge the alliance?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many do not want to see Sinn Féin/IRA take
                part in an Executive without decommissioning. Why punish our own
                people again and again? Will we be ambushed again today? Now
                Unionists are expected to approve cross-border bodies, with
                stand-alone executive powers, without one gun being handed over.
                Those who had any doubt that the approval of this report was a
                back-door passport to allow Sinn&nbsp;Féin/IRA into an
                Executive should have voted against it. The Ulster Unionist
                Party leader could have defended that action by explaining that
                the IRA are unreconstructed terrorists. Instead, the party
                choose to ambush fellow Unionists by jumping into bed with its
                friends, IRA/Sinn Féin. This motion would be unnecessary if
                protocol had been observed.</p>

                Fifty&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent of the Members of your party spoke in
                the debate, but now, when a Member is describing what took place

                unnecessary had proper protocol been observed. The voting
                alliance of the Ulster Unionists and Sinn Féin has now been
                exposed. I hope that such motions will be unnecessary in future.
                I support the motion — free speech is a right, not a

                which has caused so much offence and hurt, will never be

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am one of the Members who were listed to
                speak on 18&nbsp;January in a debate which was originally billed
                as a three-day event. I understand that it had been agreed to by
                all the parties at a CAPO meeting. I contend that the Initial
                Presiding Officer — namely, the Member for East Belfast, the
                Lord&nbsp;Alderdice — in allowing the closure motion to be put
                on Monday 18&nbsp;January, did quite wantonly and outrageously,
                and apparently without regret, disenfranchise a significant
                proportion of the electorate in my constituency.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also assert that by his action he
                deliberately pandered to the wishes of certain pro-agreement
                elements in the Ulster Unionist Party and beyond. Had I been
                able to speak on 18&nbsp;January, as it was my steadfast hope to
                do, I might well have concluded that the Assembly, having been
                set up with such ill-advised haste following the signing of the
                Belfast Agreement, had resulted in an unholy mess. The befuddled
                thinking behind the emanating documentation, including the
                report presented to the Assembly on 18&nbsp;January by the First
                Minister (Designate) and the Deputy First Minister (Designate),
                beggars belief.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister (Designate) attempted to
                explain away his folly by telling Members that a final report
                would be necessary as there were certain areas of government
                which had not been fully considered. It was due to his
                ineptitude that these essential areas — for example, the Child
                Support Agency — were overlooked, forgotten or ignored. They
                should have been included in the agreement between the Ulster
                Unionist Party and the SDLP reached on 18&nbsp;December 1998.

                under which we can operate. Furthermore, these Orders make no

                Initial Presiding Officer, Lord&nbsp;Alderdice, I cannot now, or
                in the future, be comforted that he will be any more judicious
                than he has been to date in looking after the interests of

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thought that Mr&nbsp;M&nbsp;Robinson had a
                point of order to develop before I spoke.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There have been a number of references in
                this debate to the meeting of CAPO. It was hard to find them in
                among the diatribes against the Ulster Unionist Party, but there
                were one or two. I wish to establish clearly what happened in
                those discussions in CAPO because not one but two meetings of
                that Committee were called to consider the arrangements for the
                plenary session on 18&nbsp;January&nbsp;1999. The normal CAPO
                meeting was held on 11&nbsp;January&nbsp;1999, and at that
                meeting a suggestion was made which led to a consultation on
                extending speaking time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Proposals on which there was consultation
                were that the proposer should have up to 30&nbsp;minutes instead
                of 20&nbsp;minutes; that all parties in the first round should
                have 20&nbsp;minutes rather than 10&nbsp;minutes; that there
                should be wind-up speeches for the larger parties of
                20&nbsp;minutes (a precedent); and that the winding-up by the
                proposer of the motion should be extended to 20&nbsp;minutes.
                Those would have been major changes in the time allowed for
                Members to speak.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We also discussed the length of time for
                debate at that meeting, and we talked about setting aside Monday
                and Tuesday with the possibility of running on into Wednesday.
                We never talked about a three-day debate, but we did, when we
                were discussing longer speeches, refer to a two-day debate.
                Consultation was required on that as well as on other issues
                relating to the motion to be debated. To have changed the length
                of the speeches would have required a variation of the Standing
                Orders, and that could only have been done by leave of the
                House.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We needed to consider the matter and meet
                again, which we did on Friday, 15&nbsp;January&nbsp;1999. There
                was no agreement at that meeting on changing the length of
                speeches, so we had no further discussion. Perhaps, at that
                point, we should have had more discussion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Perhaps the entire membership of CAPO was at
                fault in considering whether we needed so long if the speeches
                were going to be shorter. It could be argued that we should have
                discussed it. What is not true is the kind of suggestion that
                has come from several DUP Members that we had agreed a three-day
                debate when we knew there were only going to be 10-minute
                speeches. That is not the case. What we did was ill-considered,
                but when we decided not to change the length of the speeches,
                clearly a change was made to the length of time required for the
                debate as a whole. We had originally been allowing for the
                possibility of longer speeches.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What we established at that point is what we
                have established today: this debate has absolutely nothing to do
                with whether we have confidence or not in the Initial Presiding
                Officer. We are not discussing the issue in the way CAPO
                discussed it or voted on it. It is quite clear from the speeches
                from the DUP and the UUAP that they are merely trying to rehash
                the debate that was shortened on the 18&nbsp;January&nbsp;1999,
                and to discuss this any further is a waste of time. There are
                other more important matters to discuss in a fortnight’s time
                and much more to do. Since the DUP is incapable of talking to
                the motion it has proposed, it, like I, should cease speaking
                now.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Clyde:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support all that has been said by my DUP
                colleagues today. I have no confidence in the Initial Presiding
                Officer because of the way that he acted during the debate on
                18&nbsp;January when he allowed a guillotine motion to bring to
                an end a debate that was very important for
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland. I question his judgement and the
                reasoning that lay behind his allowing the premature closure of
                what had already been agreed would be at least a two-day debate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was a false statement levelled against the
                DUP and democracy, although one could say that his judgement was
                in line with the so-called peace process, which, by its bending
                of the rules, denial of the truth, and &quot;Yes&quot; campaign’s
                spin doctoring, was deforming democracy to suit its own ends. By
                his actions on 18&nbsp;January, the Initial Presiding Officer
                denied me democracy. True democracy is a precious jewel with
                many bright facets, including the freedom of speech and the
                opportunity to exercise that freedom. By allowing the guillotine
                motion, Lord&nbsp;Alderdice denied me the opportunity to speak
                during the debate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I object to the formation of
                10&nbsp;Government Departments when only seven are required to
                run Northern&nbsp;Ireland efficiently. Three extra Government
                Departments will add an additional £90&nbsp;million to the
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland budget — money that would be better
                spent on our hospitals, education and infrastructure. However,
                it seems that Ulster Unionist Party Members — even against the
                better judgement of their own Westminster MPs and European MP
                — are determined to have &quot;jobs for the boys&quot;.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On 18&nbsp;January the Initial Presiding
                Officer decided that democracy was downgraded for all, not just
                me. As the DUP representative for South Antrim I have recently
                received views from many outraged Unionists. They expected that
                such an important subject as the proposed future structures of
                the Government of Northern&nbsp;Ireland would have been afforded
                at least the time agreed during the Committee meeting —
                namely, two days. They were not surprised that the Ulster
                Unionist Party Member for South Antrim moved a motion to close
                off debate. It seems to be more important for the Ulster
                Unionist Party to keep their new-found friends in the SDLP and
                Sinn Féin happy. Mr&nbsp;Trimble was quoted in the ‘Irish
                News’ on Tuesday 29&nbsp;December as having said</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;we are, I think, fast becoming
                inseparable.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This newly formed alliance between the UUP
                and SDLP Members worked well in order to bring about the
                guillotine motion, and the Unionist majority is asking what
                other tricks lie in store from these new-found friends.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support this motion of no confidence
                motion. The Initial Presiding Officer’s actions on
                18&nbsp;January added to a process that will see democracy being
                demolished. Some Members know all about demolishing. They have
                demolished lives, families, friends, towns and villages. All
                they seem to know is how to destroy and demolish, and they are
                now involved in a process of demolishing democracy. These might
                seem like strong words, but it is my honest opinion and that of
                the majority of Unionists with whom I am in contact that this is
                pulling down democracy. The process is clear to see — for
                example, the issue of decommissioning, or should I say the total
                lack of it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Democracy has not been well-served: this
                issue is continually side-lined by some and pushed further down
                the pipeline by others. No, democracy has not been well served.
                Nor was it well served when Lord&nbsp;Alderdice took the
                decision on Monday, 18&nbsp;January to move the guillotine
                motion, a decision which, to many inside and outside this
                Assembly, was taken rather quickly. I was amazed at the speed of
                that decision if, indeed, he had no pre-knowledge of what was
                going to happen. It was all settled rather quickly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am sorry that, for the reasons I have
                given, Lord&nbsp;Alderdice does not give me, or the people I
                represent, reason to have confidence in him.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support fully the DUP’s no-confidence
                motion.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Foster:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was not my intention to become embroiled
                in this debate, but I do contend that the motion is uncalled for
                and is of shabby appearance. It is really an attempt to redress
                injured pride rather than be constructive for the benefit of the
                people of Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not agree with all the philosophy of
                Lord Alderdice, nor, I am quite sure, does he with mine.
                However, I do contend that he performs the onerous duties of
                Initial Presiding Officer of the Assembly with great skill,
                consistency of integrity, impartiality and obvious
                responsibility, and that has to be admired. He brings
                commendable dignity to his role and to the Assembly. I am not
                convinced that there are many others who could do equally or
                even nearly as well.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What was his problem a couple of weeks ago?
                He carried out his responsibilities — nothing more and nothing
                less. The meaning of Standing Order&nbsp;11(1) which has been
                mentioned before — and I will not read it again — it is very
                clear. Thus I contend that this motion is shabby; is intended to
                be disruptive; and is sheer hypocrisy. It is an endeavour to
                destabilise the Assembly by stone-walling, filibustering and
                freebooting methods. It is pitiful, unforgivable, very base and
                typifies low-grade politics.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are Members of the Assembly who, when
                we talk about origins, profess loud and lustily the Word of God.
                My experience here and at the Northern&nbsp;Ireland Forum, is
                that many Christian virtues are lacking. There are biblical
                words that apply to all of us:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;For whosoever exalteth himself shall be
                abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I make that point today because what we have
                is self-gratification — an attempt to redress damaged pride,
                which falls short of Christian virtues. I am told that pride was
                a greater share than goodness of heart. <i>[Interruption]</p>

                Members in this Chamber know all about ambushes. It was rather
                sad to see the Ulster Unionists get involved in an ambush on
                fellow Unionists on 18&nbsp;January, to try and stifle debate in

                waited until a member of the Democratic Unionist Party got up to

                were not on their feet trying to stifle debate when Sinn Féin/IRA
                was speaking. On 18&nbsp;January the Ulster Unionists, along
                with the SDLP and Sinn Féin, knew exactly what they were doing
                — strange bedfellows.</p>

                Tuesday or Wednesday, and there are a number of questions he
                must answer. Clearly the SDLP knew all about it, because during
                the debate on housing that evening, a Member referred to the
                situation. His information on the day was that the debate would

                that was not my intention. I have been interrupted so many times
                by Mr&nbsp;J&nbsp;Wilson, who seems to have no problem when it
                comes to interrupting DUP speakers. The Ulster Unionists have
                added very little to today’s debate — I could count those
                who have spoken on the fingers of one hand — but they are good
                at interrupting and making points of order. They make no points
                of order when the SDLP or Sinn Féin are speaking. I saw
                Mr&nbsp;Wilson giving instructions earlier; perhaps one of them
                was not to interrupt SDLP or Sinn Féin, but when a DUP man gets
                up to speak, make sure that he is interrupted.</p>

                has a number of questions to answer about his rulings on
                18&nbsp;January. It is a conspiracy — and this is what the
                Ulster Unionists cannot seem to understand, for whatever reason
                — by the Ulster Unionists, SDLP and Sinn Féin. In the last
                30&nbsp;years, certain gentlemen on my right have happily
                ambushed a number of people and, on 18&nbsp;January, the Ulster
                Unionists were happy to get into bed with them and ambush the
                Democratic Unionist Party. That is sad.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Paisley Jnr:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have listened with interest to the debate
                and also to the time-wasting by many of the Members opposite,
                particularly SDLP Members. They have accused others of bringing
                this House into disrepute but, by their own actions, have been
                party to doing the same thing in the use of unparliamentary
                language by the Member for South Belfast and by the time-wasting
                effort of the Member for Mid Ulster, Mr&nbsp;Haughey, who
                constantly made frivolous and repetitive points of order after
                he had been ruled out of order.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The DUP has brought forward this motion of no
                confidence because the procedures used on 18&nbsp;January ought
                not to have been used. Mr&nbsp;Hilditch was very clear — he
                was denied his right to free speech. Two other colleagues
                intended to make their maiden speeches and were denied the
                opportunity to speak and raise issues. Such issues are at the
                heart of the establishment of this Assembly and at the heart of
                the progress of democracy in Northern&nbsp;Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Others have raised the question of balance,
                including Members from the parties opposite. There was no
                balance given to the parties in the debate on 18&nbsp;January.
                That is why we found Lord&nbsp;Alderdice’s ruling so
                irreconcilable. Less than a quarter of my party’s speakers
                were given the opportunity to express their point of view. Less
                than a third of the entire House had the opportunity to put
                their points to the Assembly. Other parties got considerably
                more than a quarter, some got 50% and one Member,
                Mr&nbsp;Hutchinson, got 100%. That balance was totally unfair;
                there ought to be balance given, especially to a party with a
                large mandate like the DUP which is the third largest party in
                the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The sequence of events in the Chamber
                indicates that the Initial Presiding Officer was a party to a
                set-up, a conspiracy to stifle free speech and free debate in
                this Chamber. It is quite obvious that there was a series of
                nods and winks indicating that if the debate were cut short and
                those who opposed the report of the First and Deputy First
                Minister (Designate) were silenced, then the Initial Presiding
                Officer would be able perhaps to secure his position. A
                Presiding Officer or a Speaker should have neither eyes to see
                nor ears to hear any matter that goes against the interests of
                the Back-Bench Members of this House.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On 18&nbsp;January Lord&nbsp;Alderdice so
                abused his position that he breached the trust and confidence
                that Members must have in him to be fair and impartial. He
                abused his position in connivance with a party or parties to the
                detriment of the rights of Back-Bench Members. That is
                unforgivable. If we cannot trust the Presiding Officer to uphold
                our rights whom can we trust to ensure that we have free and
                fair debate in this House? This is not a personal matter against
                John&nbsp;Alderdice, rather it is about the abuse of the
                privilege and trust given to him by the Members of the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This debate has a second purpose, which is to
                ensure that precedent is not established by the faulty
                application of the procedural motion to vote without there first
                being a complete debate. Lord&nbsp;Alderdice’s actions were
                wrong, and this House should censure them. I have listened to
                the one-dimensional argument of the Ulster Unionist Party and
                the SDLP. Since 18&nbsp;January those parties have complained
                that the debate was repetitious. So what if it was repetitious?
                Mr&nbsp;Haughey drew attention to many of the speeches made by
                Members from this side of the House and tried to answer their
                points; he failed to answer their points but did draw attention
                to the fact that several points had been raised. From what he
                said, it was certainly not repetitious.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.00 pm</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members are entitled to say what is on their
                minds. If they believe in the same policies and share the same
                objectives, then the debate will have many facets. The Ulster
                Unionist Party does not understand about sharing the same ideas
                because many of them have different ideas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is very interesting to hear SDLP Members,
                in particular, lecturing about repetition. How often we have
                been subjected to the single transferable speech of their Leader
                &quot;The French are still French, and the Germans still German.
                You cannot eat a flag.&quot; If SDLP Members are sick of
                repetition, perhaps they should ditch their Leader. Did they not
                realise they had a lot to gain from a repetitious debate? They
                could have said &quot;It had petered out. They did not have the
                ability to keep the debate going.&quot; They chose a different
                tack, the subtlety of which was lost on myself and many others:
                they chose to silence people they claimed were being
                repetitious. Their tactics were lost on many people inside and
                outside the House.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First and Deputy First Ministers
                (Designate) lost the moral high ground by bringing forward the
                motion, and therefore, they had to seek a procedural mechanism
                to prevent the debate from flowing. They were angry and could
                not take the heat. One defector had already decided that he was
                going to cross to this side of the House, and they knew that if
                the debate continued over two days and public pressure mounted,
                more Members would feel under pressure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the day of the debate Mr&nbsp;Roy&nbsp;Beggs&nbsp;Jnr
                was reported on the front page of the ‘Belfast Telegraph’ as
                saying that he would have to vote against the report because of
                its contents. Yet he had to vote with the report. We believe
                that he was pressurised to do so. If another day had been
                allowed for the debate, perhaps he would have had the freedom he
                wanted during that vote.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We then had the blatant misrepresentation by
                the Deputy First Minister (Designate) that he had been
                guillotined and if he could be guillotined, then everyone else
                could be also. The Deputy First Minister (Designate) was not
                guillotined, and he knows it. He wanted personal, special
                privileges and extra time for himself, not for his party. He
                thought that he could then force the rest of the House to accept
                that he had special privileges.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Having listened to the Deputy First Minister
                (Designate) over the years, I know he would like special
                privileges. He used to tell us that when he came to this
                building his flesh crawled when he had to pass that terrible
                statue of Carson. He also told us that when he was in the talks
                he hated sitting at that table from Gosford Castle.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But the baubles of office, the bulging pay
                cheque from the British Exchequer and his new-found polite tones
                have made him believe that he has privileges above and beyond
                other Members of this House. He has not. He has the same
                privilege as every other Member — the right to be elected and
                speak on behalf of their constituents. Unfortunately, on
                18&nbsp;January, he was party to a conspiracy to deny other
                Members the opportunity and privilege to speak on behalf of
                their constituents. He should be ashamed of his behaviour and of
                the excuse he made after the debate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On 18&nbsp;January the country witnessed the
                Ulster Unionist Party’s, the SDLP’s and, indeed, Sinn Féin’s
                fear of public debate. People witnessed one Ulster Unionist
                Party Member not doing anything special — holding to his
                election pledge — but they also witnessed 27&nbsp;others
                abandoning theirs. The country saw that and rejected it. Had the
                debate been allowed to continue, there might have been a better
                decision taken and we might have had the opportunity to explore
                other avenues — for instance, the make-up of the cabinet, the
                Executive and the Departments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the ‘Coleraine Chronicle’ of
                12&nbsp;December&nbsp;1998, Mr&nbsp;Beggs, Mr&nbsp;Nesbitt and
                another member of the Ulster Unionst Party made it clear that
                there should be no real movement until there was substantial
                decommissioning. Mr&nbsp;Beggs stated that the Ulster Unionist
                Party was the only one that wanted seven Departments — that
                the SDLP wanted&nbsp;10.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yet, in that debate all those Members were
                forced to vote in a way which imposed 10&nbsp;Departments on us.
                Mr&nbsp;Ken&nbsp;Maginnis said that this was the worst example
                of &quot;snouts-in-the-trough&quot; politics. We had the right
                to speak in that debate whether we had things of substance to
                say or not. We were denied that right.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We hear a lot about accountable democracy,
                and I addressed that in my first speech in the House. I intended
                to address it again in my second speech, which was to have been
                during the last sitting. Unfortunately that sitting was
                guillotined, and I did not have the opportunity to speak on that
                subject.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That that happened is much to the shame of
                Lord Alderdice and the Ulster Unionist Party, which joined up
                with the SDLP and Sinn Féin — an unholy coalition — to
                guillotine the motion before the Assembly that day. That motion
                was the most important motion to come before the Assembly for
                debate since its inception. Since the agreement was signed the
                biggest decisions, decisions which will copper fasten the
                agreement, have been taken in December 1998 and January 1999
                when the House voted to endorse the Report from the First
                Minister (Designate) and the Deputy First Minister (Designate).</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion before the Assembly on
                18&nbsp;January&nbsp;1999 was worthy of a two-day debate at
                least. CAPO agreed to have a two-day debate. Lord&nbsp;Alderdice
                allowed the debate to be guillotined because he felt that all
                parties had been given a fair opportunity to have their voices
                heard. That is patently wrong and patently untrue. Lord&nbsp;Alderdice
                made a prejudiced and partisan decision on that day.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Five out of 20&nbsp;Members from the
                Democratic Unionist Party had an opportunity to speak. Some
                parties had 50% of their Members called to speak while others
                had 100% called. The Democratic&nbsp;Unionist&nbsp;Party had
                only 25% of its Members who were down to speak called. This
                calls into question the system for calling Members to speak, the
                system by which the Initial Presiding Officer goes round each
                party once before returning to the main parties. In situations
                where debates are to be brief, this system does not give
                Back-Benchers in the larger parties much opportunity to speak.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not count myself as any less a Member
                than Members from the Progressive&nbsp;Unionist&nbsp;Party, the
                Women’s&nbsp;Coalition or any of the other small parties. I
                was elected here, and I have the same mandate to speak as anyone
                else in the Chamber — particularly when time has been set
                aside for a motion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There was no other pressing business on that
                day. I listened when Mr&nbsp;Ford said how busy we were. There
                have not been many debates in the House so far. I am fairly busy
                as I am trying to set up a constituency office in
                Lagan&nbsp;Valley, but I know that other Members are not as busy
                because they are not doing that sort of thing. They have plenty
                of time to take part in debates because they are doing very
                little else. As this was a very important debate and Members
                should have had an opportunity to speak, it was the Initial
                Presiding Officer’s responsibility to ensure that minority
                parties got that opportunity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those of us in the &quot;No&quot; camp in the
                Assembly are in the minority, and we see the
                Ulster&nbsp;Unionist&nbsp;Party, the SDLP, Sinn Féin, the
                Alliance Party, the Women’s Coalition and the
                Progressive&nbsp;Unionist&nbsp;Party banding together on a
                regular basis to vote down the people who were against the
                agreement. It is the Initial Presiding Officer’s duty to
                ensure that people in the &quot;No&quot; camp have an
                opportunity to put their case, however much he loathes what they
                say.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We had a case which we put to the electorate
                and for which we received significant support. Lord&nbsp;Alderdice
                must ensure that the Members of the Democratic Unionist Party
                have the opportunity to speak.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We hear that this agreement is about give and
                take and that both sides have to give. We know what the Unionist
                side has had to give. They have had to give acceptance to the
                release of prisoners; they have had to allow Sinn Féin into
                government; and they have had to give acceptance to the
                establishment of the North/South bodies — bodies which these
                Members agreed to and voted for on that particular day. However,
                we cannot understand what Sinn Féin has had to give up.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some people have had to give up procuring
                weapons to stand for election; some people have had to give up
                planting bombs and setting off explosions; and other people have
                had to give up attempting to murder. That was not much to give
                up in return for a position worth £30,000 per year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What is amazing is that members of the Ulster
                Unionist Party can join in a coalition with these people and
                vote with these people against their Unionist colleagues and
                against the Unionist people. Such behaviour is morally wrong and
                corrupt. It is also wrong that the Initial Presiding Officer
                should have shown such prejudice and such partisanship in
                allowing the closure motion to go forward.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion of no confidence in the
                Initial Presiding Officer. It is not a motion I would support
                lightly. The office of Presiding Officer in the Assembly is a
                very important office and its incumbent should act with decorum
                and impartiality.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Lord Alderdice has not acted in such a
                manner. It is significant that Mrs&nbsp;Betty&nbsp;Boothroyd,
                who is acknowledged as a competent and capable Speaker,
                indicated that she would not have allowed the motion to be
                closed had she been in the same position as Lord&nbsp;Alderdice.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Did Lord Alderdice take any advice on this
                matter, or did he act as he did because, as an interim Presiding
                Officer, he is going to have to be voted in at some stage by the
                majority of the House? It would be wise for him to keep in with
                those parties which have the majority in the House who could put
                him into the Chair permanently. I believe that Lord&nbsp;Alderdice
                took the decision on the closure motion on a partisan basis and
                not on a fair and equal basis. That is why we are having this
                debate today. This is a genuine and proper debate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I regret that Mr&nbsp;McDonnell indicated
                that we were bully boys and thugs. I am not a bully boy or a
                thug. I respect Alistair&nbsp;McDonnell, both as an opponent and
                as a friend. I have met him many times and while in the
                Waterfront&nbsp;Hall he introduced me to the Mayor of Barcelona.
                I am surprised that he introduced the Mayor of Barcelona to a
                person he considers a thug or a bully boy. The real thugs and
                bully boys are those who beat people to a pulp with their
                baseball bats and hurley sticks and whose representatives are
                sitting in this very Chamber, and to whom the SDLP are cuddling
                up every day.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The thugs and bully boys are not the Members
                who come and participate in the cut and thrust of debate. The
                thugs and bully boys are those Members who sit like muted rats
                except when they try to interrupt Members who are speaking,
                particularly Members who are speaking for the first time and who
                are not particularly confident, in an attempt to put them off.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is regrettable that the Ulster Unionists
                behave in this way. I notice that Mr&nbsp;Wilson is sitting with
                a smarmy smile on his face. He is the one who has asked his
                colleagues to interrupt the speeches of the DUP and the Unionist
                people, while ignoring the speeches made by Sinn Féin and the
                SDLP. Of course these Members are now his colleagues and his
                friends.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev William McCrea:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is with sadness rather than joy that one
                takes part in such a debate. It is important that business is
                conducted in a proper fashion. Healthy debate should not be
                denied. If Members knew anything of debate in the House of
                Commons they would know that this is nothing like real debate.
                There is plenty of thrust and hard debate in the House of
                Commons, and new Members are willing to take it. There is an old
                adage:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;If you can’t stand the heat, get out
                of the kitchen.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some people want special treatment as Members
                of the Assembly, but they do not like the thrust of debate. This
                motion deals with important issues. My hon&nbsp;Friends have
                given many reasons why it is important that this debate take
                place. There is nothing personal in my remarks concerning
                Lord&nbsp;Alderdice. He has been courteous with me on many
                occasions in this House and has shown courtesy as the Initial
                Presiding Officer.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, we are dealing with a particular
                issue, and it goes to the core of what we are about here —
                dealing with issues which are so relevant and so important to
                the future of our country. If anyone asks me why I should be
                excited, or why I should want to take part in one of the most
                important debates about the future of my country I tell them
                that I have an interest in my country, an interest in the future
                of my children.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Therefore the Initial Presiding Officer, when
                he ended the debate, was denying my right to discuss matters
                that are very important and go to the very heart of the future
                of this Province and what kind of society we are going to have.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I remember Terence O’Neill saying many
                years ago &quot;What kind of Ulster do you want?&quot; That was
                the type of a debate that we ought to have had because we were
                deciding the kind of Ulster and the kind of future our children
                were going to have.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I, as a Member of the Assembly, wanted to
                participate in that debate, and when the Initial Presiding
                Officer allowed the guillotine motion it was not put by those
                who had an interest in the debate. Even today the largest party
                in the Assembly, the Ulster Unionist Party, made one short
                statement concerning its position.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I can understand that some Members from the
                Ulster Unionist Party were not feeling aggrieved about the
                guillotine. The truth is that they were not permitted to speak
                on that occasion because the Whip could not be sure what they
                might say. There are many concerned people, for whom I have
                respect, in the Ulster Unionist Party. Many of them were deeply
                moved by this issue. However, they were not allowed to speak in
                case they did not tow the party line.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support this motion. I was denied my right
                to speak on behalf of the people who elected me.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When I am not speaking I notice many
                wonderful things. Today I saw Mr&nbsp;Wilson directing his
                colleagues: &quot;Get up, get up. Make interventions&quot;, and
                their hands were going feverishly to stop the Democratic
                Unionist Party Members from exercising their right of free
                speech.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I think that when Mr&nbsp;Wilson considers
                the matter, in the context of the Unionist family, he will have
                second thoughts. He has not done his people, and the Unionist
                people, proud today. He had no contribution to make himself, but
                he tried to stop free speech and debate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If a Member has a response to a point in the
                debate, he should stand up and make it; if not, he should sit
                and remain silent. However, a Member should never orchestrate
                matters to remove the right of free speech from others. It
                should never happen within the Unionist family, bearing in mind
                that Unionist Members have to endure seeing the representatives
                of murderers and gangsters all around them. I feel angry and
                frustrated, and I resent that, even in these circumstances,
                there are colleagues from the family of Unionism trying to stop
                free speech.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Foster started to quote the Bible.
                Maybe he is not the best authority on the Scriptures, and
                perhaps he should look closely at some of those verses again.</p>

                regard him as a theologian. I will not enter a theological
                debate, which would be ruled out of order anyway.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the Initial Presiding Officer was
                reaching his decision he had to consider whether he felt there
                had been an adequate, balanced debate. I will remind the House
                and tell the Initial Presiding Officer the balance:
                22&nbsp;Members on the pro-agreement side and nine Members on
                the anti-agreement side. Oh yes! There was balance.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No. I have only a short time, and I am using
                it profitably for the cause of Ulster. It is shameful to suggest
                that five hours’ debate is too long to debate the future of
                one’s country, that five&nbsp;hours is too long to debate the
                future of one’s children or grandchildren. Those who supported
                such a decision ought to bow their heads in shame. They were
                doing no service whatsoever to the future of democracy in this
                society.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not surprised that Sinn Féin would want
                to stop me from speaking. They have done that for years; they
                have tried to murder me and silence me for years. I can take
                that: the enemies of Ulster are enemies of myself because I am
                speaking on behalf of Ulster. But what I cannot take, and what I
                resent most, is that those who are supposed to be in the
                Unionist family would stop me, a representative of the Unionist
                people who topped the poll in Mid Ulster.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Mr&nbsp;McCrea for keeping closely to
                the debate. However, he has started moving away and I remind him
                to return to the subject.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not object to Members making genuine
                interventions. However, Mr&nbsp;Foster moved away from the
                debate throughout his speech, so he should not be lecturing me.
                This is the reason why I am aggrieved and why I support the
                motion before the House, though it gives me no joy to do so. As
                I sat in the House, and during the break, several Members from
                different parties — all bar Sinn Féin; I do not deal or talk
                with them — said to me &quot;Do you know what you are doing?
                Do you know that you are strengthening Mr&nbsp;Alderdice’s
                position? We have to say what a great person he is and support
                him.&quot; That is why there was only one speaker from the
                Ulster Unionists — they did not want to say that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the SDLP has been more vocal and I
                would say, with the greatest respect, to Lord&nbsp;Alderdice
                that my party may have assisted him somewhat. Anyone voting for
                him today could not turn around and support a vote of no
                confidence in him tomorrow.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to remind Members that we are
                here because the electorate sent us here. As a democrat, I
                respect the right of others to have their say in this Chamber
                and to express their views — no matter how much I may disagree
                with them —but I was denied my democratic right when I was not
                allowed to speak in the debate on 18&nbsp;January.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to make three points in relation to
                today’s motion. First, I want to talk about the decision to
                guillotine the debate and its implications. The Order Paper
                clearly stated that three days were being given to debate the
                report prepared by the First Minister (Designate) and Deputy
                First Minister (Designate). It further stated that the Assembly
                was to sit each day at 10.30&nbsp;am. Every indication was that
                there was to be a three-day sitting.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But, contrary to that decision made prior to
                the Assembly’s sitting, the Ulster Unionists and their new
                friends among the Nationalists proceeded to break that
                agreement. That implies that whenever these two&nbsp;groups
                decide that they do not like what they are hearing, and having
                set a precedent in which the Initial Presiding Officer
                acquiesced, they will stifle the rest of us. That is the message
                being given.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My second point relates to the reasoning
                behind this. According to Mr&nbsp;Mallon, speaking on radio on
                the following Tuesday, the debate was becoming sterile and
                nothing new was being said. Given that logic, both he and Sinn
                Féin/IRA need speak only once a year since they never have
                anything new to say except to repeat their anti-British rhetoric
                and parrot their united-Ireland slogans. Of course, it would be
                different for Mr&nbsp;Trimble. He and his colleagues change
                their policy every day, so they would need to speak quite often.
                In fact, not many of them seem to know what their policy is.
                That intellectual giant, Mr&nbsp;Nesbitt, speaking to
                Stewartstown Ulster Unionists said</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;I see there is some uneasiness among
                Unionism as to where we are going, but that is one of the
                reasons why I wish to make it clear to you that, both in our
                policy and in what we will accept and now accept, we are
                clear.&quot;</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I then come to the claims made about this
                Assembly. It was hailed as the dawning of a new era — the
                beginning of democracy. Mr&nbsp;Mallon is on record as saying
                that Northern Ireland had moved from the physical process to the
                political process. That statement is, of course, nonsense, given
                the hundreds who have been and are still being beaten almost to
                death.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Looking at the decision that he and the
                Ulster Unionist Party took, the only thing that has changed is
                the means used to silence the pro-Union majority. While Sinn
                Féin/IRA has done all it can to erase any semblance of our
                Britishness, the SDLP is doing all it can to make sure that we
                do not have too much of a voice — just enough to give an air
                of respectability to the proceedings. Nationalism has always
                been Fascist in its approach; now it is aided and abetted by
                compliant Unionists.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As for democracy and accountability, if Sinn
                Féin/IRA is anything to go by, its approach to the financial
                corruption in the Dáil, as recorded in the ‘Irish&nbsp;News’
                of 27&nbsp;January&nbsp;1999, is</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So they are clear in their approach: nothing

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Even the tiny Alliance Party — that citadel
                of democracy — has ditched the pretence of believing in free
                speech. One of its councillors is recorded in the ‘Belfast
                Telegraph’ of 26&nbsp;January as having said</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another councillor is on record as endorsing
                what she described as &quot;social engineering&quot;.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In short, the decision to halt the debate was
                to make sure that the message of the pro-Union Members who
                represent the majority of the Unionist population was stifled.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Trimble did not want to hear. He has
                private meetings with Mr&nbsp;Adams to hear what he has to say,
                but he endorses the abuse of procedures in order to silence
                fellow Unionists who oppose his betrayal and who represent the
                majority of the Unionist community. I support the motion.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Gibson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When one considers the number of debates that
                have taken place in the Assembly, it is clear that the decision
                on 18&nbsp;December was taken very early. It is important to
                remember that we have been involved in setting what may turn out
                to be a precedent. This debate is not a reaction to the
                pettiness of the Arthur&nbsp;Daleys of Unionism. It is about the
                principle and the decision which was taken on that occasion. In
                our previous sitting there was repetition. Mr&nbsp;McGimpsey
                repeated a confession list of concessions to the IRA that had
                already been set out by Robert&nbsp;McCartney. At that sitting
                no one jumped up on points of order.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members on the anti-agreement Unionist side
                are exactly the same in number as those on the pro-agreement
                Unionist side. Many of the anti-agreement Unionists topped the
                poll in their constituencies. Therefore, a greater number of
                Unionists said no to the agreement. When it was arranged and
                contrived that their voice should be stifled, there was a
                deliberate attempt to coerce. If the political promiscuity of
                Jim&nbsp;Wilson and his colleagues has seduced the Initial
                Presiding Officer, it is time that we drew to the Initial
                Presiding Officer’s attention the fact that he has a duty to
                reflect the feelings of all Members.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The speeches by Mr&nbsp;Taylor and
                Reginald&nbsp;Empey and all the others who enjoy DUP-bashing
                display the weakness of their case. There was an infernal row
                among Ulster Unionist Party Members on 2&nbsp;December and they
                engage in DUP bashing to hide the wounds within their own ranks.
                It was obvious that the bouncers, the so-called Whips, were
                leaning heavily on dissident Members an hour before the vote was
                taken. The bully-boy tactics which are condemned when they are
                used on the streets are apparent in the Assembly Lobby.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A structure so young and tender and in its
                formative stage must be treated with more respect. The Chair
                should not be subjected to the pressure that it was so obviously
                put under at the last plenary session to put the Question. It
                had obviously been decided that when the Question was put, the
                Initial Presiding Officer could abandon his responsibility,
                knowing full well that there was already an orchestrated
                decision.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We hope that the Initial Presiding Officer
                will take on board what has been said in the debate because it
                has been said not out of arrogance or spite. This is being put
                forward as a means of trying to make the Assembly work to the
                credit of Northern&nbsp;Ireland, to the credit of us in it and,
                indeed, to his credit. We are trying to show that what was done
                creates a precedent — and it could be a very dangerous
                precedent. If it were used in reverse, we would hear an awful
                lot of whinging from Benches other than our own, and that is
                something for the Presiding Officer to reflect upon, and I do
                not mean that to be a direct admonishment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Initial Presiding Officer was under
                pressure. While SDLP people today came out in his support to
                some extent, they are no particular friends of Lord&nbsp;Alderdice.
                It is well known that he is tolerated — just about — by the
                Official Unionists. In fact, it could be tactical on our part to
                reinforce the Speaker’s position, but the decision taken on
                that day has to be examined. At the previous meeting, in spite
                of all the heckling that went on, we talked about building trust
                and giving confidence. What confidence was given by the tactics
                used in that instance? Fifty per cent of the Unionists’
                representatives were vetoed by another 50%, and they should
                think honestly about what they did.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Maybe I will be forgiven for a slight
                digression. I, as someone from West&nbsp;Tyrone, look at the
                tombstones of those who have been murdered. One of them, from
                north Strabane, was Senator&nbsp;Barnhill, who was in the other
                Chamber in this House. He and his sister were killed early in
                this 30-year campaign. He was responsible for making
                arrangements for the Americans to come to Derry and use it as a
                base in the Second World War. Do Members think that
                Senator&nbsp;Barnhill, as an Official Unionist representative in
                this House, would have condoned the conduct of the Chief Whips
                at the last meeting?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Or look at the tombstone outside my own
                village, in the parish of Clogher. There are 21 names on it.
                Strangely, the first name on it is that of a man called
                Clements, who taught my children and whose sister is married to
                my brother — a leading Official Unionist. At the bottom of the
                list is a personal friend of mine, Ivan&nbsp;Anderson. The day
                before he was killed we spent an hour checking whether he had
                made his will and had made his peace with God — he knew he was
                going to be killed. He was the secretary of the Official
                Unionists in my area. Do Members think that he would have
                condoned what Mr&nbsp;J&nbsp;Wilson and the Whips did on
                18&nbsp;January&nbsp;1999?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A sobering thought is the glee that was felt
                at that moment. I would hate to think of another line being
                added to the bottom of that memorial, dedicated by an Assembly
                Member. &quot;Could it be possible that their memory was
                betrayed by Assembly Members?&quot; Those are the thoughts that
                we need to instil, and we need to bring a little bit of stark
                reality as to what these Benches are about.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When we are talking about this agreement we
                think of King&nbsp;John and Magna Carta — the barons. Who are
                the new barons? Are they the barons of drugs; the barons of
                arson; the barons of tyranny? Who are they, and who is jumping
                to their tune? The decision was made, and I am saying to
                Lord&nbsp;Alderdice that he should reconsider that decision,
                that he should ensure that it is not a precedent. If this House
                is to have harmony, there are 28&nbsp;representatives of over
                half of the Unionist population who must be considered in future
                when decisions are being made in this Assembly.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Campbell:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The DUP did not put down this motion with any
                great relish. Many Members have referred to what happened at the
                meeting of the Committee to Advise the Presiding Officer (CAPO).
                Some Members have said that this meeting exists to give advice
                to the Initial Presiding Officer, and that is accurate — that
                is one of the reasons for its existence. However, Members who
                oppose the motion have missed the point that in the seven months
                of this Assembly there has not been another instance of the
                Committee’s advice being discarded in the way that it was on
                this occasion. So I would not put too much store by the nature
                of CAPO and what it exists to do.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">CAPO was always the Committee to Advise the
                Presiding Officer, and its members agreed unanimously the advice
                to be tendered to the Initial Presiding Officer, and the Initial
                Presiding Officer ruled and took his decision on that basis.
                Therefore, it is abundantly clear that CAPO members were in
                agreement, and there was a ruling from the Initial Presiding
                Officer.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members who oppose this motion are grasping
                at straws by trying to say that the Initial Presiding Officer
                could set aside the agreement that had been entered into
                unilaterally at the CAPO meeting. According to my list,
                Messrs&nbsp;Hilditch, Hay, Poots, Paisley&nbsp;Jnr,
                Peter&nbsp;Robinson, Kane and Mark&nbsp;Robinson from the DUP
                were due to speak. Those who, in defence of their own position,
                said that there was a wide range of Members to speak on that day
                cannot deny that many Members, whose names had been tabled and
                were due to be called, were denied the opportunity to speak. If
                they have had an opportunity to speak today, that is well and
                good — it is not before time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today every ruse imaginable — and there
                have been some disgraceful attempts — has been used to stop
                some Members from speaking. There were queries as to whether a
                Member’s paragraph or sentence contained a reference to the
                motion. Were they straying from the motion? Would they be called
                to order? Why is it that we keep getting the distinct impression
                that opposition in the Chamber is not only frowned upon, but
                will be remorselessly crushed if any attempt is made to express
                it?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today is a good day because the voices of
                those who were elected to express the views, misgivings and
                concerns of hundreds of thousands of people can, must and will
                be heard.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Presiding Officer’s decision was taken
                during the day. I had urgent business to attend to and had left
                the building. There was thought of communicating with anyone
                about the possibility of a vote. The rights of many of my party’s
                Members and those from other parties who had wished to speak
                were taken from them. They were denied those rights because of
                the Initial Presiding Officer’s decision.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today’s debate, which was agreed to
                reluctantly by some, gives Members the right to speak on behalf
                of many people. There have been attempts to stop some members
                from speaking. They have been interrupted by points of order,
                but all such efforts have failed. From this failure a lesson can
                be learned.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This will be a successful day, no matter what
                happens in the short term, if people learn a lesson from the
                fact that some Members have strong views. They were elected to
                express those views and they must be heard. There must be
                evidence that they will be heard.</p>

                State a letter directing the Assembly to meet for more than one
                day. Thus in the light of the CAPO meeting and the letter from
                the Secretary of State, we presumed that the Assembly would meet
                for more than one day. Does the Member accept that the

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not going to make any comment on the
                contribution that was made. That strikes me as odd, and, surely,
                the Initial Presiding Officer must also find it odd. The pickle
                in which the Initial Presiding Officer found himself was partly
                due to the fact that he allowed himself to be used by a party
                which feared another day’s debate on the report from the First
                Minister (Designate) and Deputy First Minister (Designate). I am
                not in a position to judge whether this was a mistake, or
                whether the Initial Presiding Officer deliberately, or
                willingly, allowed himself to be used in this way. Had I been in
                his position I would have expected more vociferous support from
                those who had created the situation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is not that there is no one in that party
                who is able to come to the defence of the Initial Presiding
                Officer. Some of us were indeed impressed by the robust — some
                might say unknightly — contribution from &quot;the knight from
                Knock&quot; in defence of his own party. It seems he had been
                carried away by the honour bestowed on him. He must have thought
                he was one of the Kray brothers — Reggie and Ronnie. He
                behaved in the House like a political Kray brother, but he is
                absent today. He has not come to the defence of the Initial
                Presiding Officer.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It strikes me as odd that the Ulster Unionist
                Party has been so quiet about this. It must be because of
                embarrassment. Many people have said that what happened on
                18&nbsp;January was embarrassing for those opposed to the
                report, and that they were ambushed. However, I believe that the
                real embarrassment is among those who moved the closure motion,
                and, by facilitating this motion, the Initial Presiding Officer
                helped to reveal the weakness of the arguments used by those who
                were in support of the report.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I listened to the speeches in the Chamber
                today it occurred to me that, as Rev&nbsp;William&nbsp;McCrea
                said, some people spoke in defence of the Initial Presiding
                Officer not because they wanted to but because they felt obliged
                to do so. This would worry me if I were in the Initial Presiding
                Officer’s position. However, my concern is with the nature of
                the defence made on behalf of the Initial Presiding Officer.
                Mr&nbsp;Paisley&nbsp;Jnr has already dealt adequately with
                criticisms about repetitiveness, although I would add that many
                people will find it odd for us to be lectured about
                repetitiveness by the SDLP. If the rule about repetitiveness is
                strictly observed in the House, there will not be many debates
                which last longer than a morning. Indeed, many of us know that
                the way to get your message across is to repeat it and repeat
                it.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No. My time is running out. Many people
                realise that repetition is an important way of getting your
                message across.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As regards some of the other arguments used,
                I found the remarks made by one of the Sinn Féin Members very
                enlightening. He said that the decision made by the Initial
                Presiding Officer in that debate was quite correct, because
                nobody is bound by any agreements. Those who believe that Sinn
                Féin has entered into an agreement with them, and that they
                have got some kind of peace agreement, should take note of what
                Mr&nbsp;Maskey said in the House this morning. He says that it
                does not matter if you make an agreement. They are not bound by
                any agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">His next argument was even more comical. It
                was &quot;We don’t have time for this; we have more important
                things to do.&quot; Those are the new-found democrats who wish
                to make the institutions of government in Northern Ireland work.
                That is almost as funny as the comment from one of his
                colleagues who knows all about broken bones. Many of them know
                about broken bones in IRA/Sinn Féin. The other morning on the
                radio he talked about the shortage of orthopaedic surgeons, and
                spoke about how he wanted to get into the Assembly to get to
                grips with the problem. Now we are told that Sinn Féin have no
                time for the motion because they have more important things to
                do.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Haughey said that many of the speeches had
                been irrelevant. If I were Lord&nbsp;Alderdice, I would be
                worried. Mr&nbsp;Haughey said that if this had been a court of
                law, he would have asked for the case to be dismissed out of
                hand because Peter&nbsp;Robinson had walked out. I will let
                Mr&nbsp;Robinson deal with that.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Haughey:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr S Wilson:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have only a minute or two left.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He then went on to a most bizarre argument.
                He said that he would be supporting the Initial Presiding
                Officer because on the day in question, the Initial Presiding
                Officer had presided over eight speeches which were totally
                irrelevant and consisted of tomfoolery and buffoonery. I would
                not support any Presiding Officer who allowed buffoonery,
                tomfoolery and eight irrelevant speeches. That was his defence
                of Lord&nbsp;Alderdice.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is clear from the debate that there is
                embarrassment. People know that the decision was wrong. Those
                who asked for it to be made are the most culpable. They acted
                out of expediency and to avoid political embarrassment. The
                mistake was that the Initial Presiding Officer allowed himself
                to be used in that exercise.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not know the outcome of this debate, and
                I would not presume to guess, but it has been important for two
                reasons. It has given people the opportunity to highlight the
                danger, as Mr&nbsp;Campbell said, of trying to stamp out
                opposition in this House for short-term expediency. It has also
                given those who were party to this an opportunity to defend
                their actions. They have been totally silent. They have not
                offered a defence.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The debate has highlighted the inadequacy of
                the party that brought this situation about and put the Initial
                Presiding Officer in the difficult position in which he finds
                himself. I trust that the lesson will be learned that in this
                House we will have the freedom of expression and freedom of
                debate that allow for proper, accountable government.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.00 pm</p>
                </i><b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Perhaps I could deal with some of the
                comments that have been made. There will be occasions when
                everyone who wishes to contribute in the Assembly will have
                important and pressing business in other parts of the Province.
                Those who aspire to ministerial and other offices will have to
                make speeches and carry out functions elsewhere. If the Member
                who referred to my absence earlier had made the least enquiry of
                me, he would have found out that the building of a
                £9&nbsp;million facility, which I had assisted in bringing to
                East&nbsp;Belfast, was starting in my constituency and that it
                was appropriate that I should be there to speak at the
                sod-cutting ceremony today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As for the comments on the absence of my
                Colleague Dr&nbsp;Paisley, given that he was attending the
                funeral of a life-long friend, it is slightly cheap that his
                absence should have been referred to. It is ironic that that
                Member should have suggested that it is a lack of courtesy for a
                Member to speak and then leave the Chamber when that same Member
                left the Chamber immediately after his speech. Those who attempt
                to lecture others should practise what they preach.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Few expected that we would have many people
                attending this debate to listen to the arguments and, in an
                open-minded way, to decide how they would vote. It is evident
                that some pre-judged the issue, including the Alliance Party.
                One of the amusing features is the ‘Belfast Telegraph’
                headline &quot;Alliance set to back Alderdice&quot; —
                something we thought we would not see again<i>. </i>We can see
                by his physical presence that we have been able to reconcile the
                Initial Presiding Officer with his former colleagues. That will
                be welcomed as much by him as by them. It is, of course,
                noticeable that one of them is not present, but I am sure that
                that has nothing to do with the fact that the Initial Presiding
                Officer is sitting among his former colleagues.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For the rest of the Members any stick was a
                good enough one with which to beat the DUP. It is not a case of
                looking at the issue and making a determination based on the
                weight of evidence that would be produced during the course of
                proceedings. If that had been done the central feature of the
                debate was the principle set down in the very first speech, one
                which not one Member has attempted to counter and that is this:
                a closure motion is not intended to curtail debate; it is
                intended to ensure that debate is not prolonged. That was the
                procedural issue upon which the Initial Presiding Officer should
                have ruled, and he did not get it right.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Monica McWilliams said that it did not do any
                good for an infant Chamber to have this sort of thing happening.
                Quite the contrary: this is exactly the kind of issue that must
                be settled at the early stages, because precedents are
                established on rulings from the Chair. That is the key issue as
                far as this debate is concerned, and one of the reasons this
                motion was moved.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In introducing the debate I indicated that we
                had scheduled a number of Members to deal with specific issues
                each on 18&nbsp;January, and I drew attention to two of those
                issues, one of which was decommissioning. The fallacy of the
                Official Unionist Party’s argument would have been exposed had
                the Initial Presiding Officer not ruled in the way that he did.
                The Official Unionist Party has now confirmed on its website the
                basis on which it believes that Sinn Féin can be excluded from
                the Executive, and that basis is the lack of decommissioning.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The reason it gives is that Sinn Féin is not
                exclusively committed to peaceful and democratic means. That
                language is used three times in the statement and has been
                extracted from the Belfast Agreement, but that is precisely the
                language that was used during the talks at
                Castle&nbsp;Buildings, and it allowed Sinn Féin into those
                talks on the basis of that same language. If it wants to rely on
                that now as a basis for not allowing Sinn Féin into an
                Executive, it should have relied on it then and come out with
                the UKUP and the DUP rather than staying in those talks on that
                same criterion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the Initial Presiding Officer had not
                ruled in the way that he did, we would have warned Ulster
                Unionist Members that by voting they were giving the green light
                to the Secretary of State to proceed to set up all of the
                structures dealt with by the report, and we would have been
                right so to have warned them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Statements were issued by the Northern
                Ireland Office indicating that she is starting to set up the
                10&nbsp;Departments even though the determination has not been
                legally approved. She has begun to create the implementation
                bodies even though the Assembly has not approved the
                determination of the First Minister (Designate) and Deputy First
                Minister (Designate). Such a vital issue should have been
                debated in the Chamber. However, because of the actions of the
                Initial Presiding Officer, we were not permitted to do that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We would have pointed out to Ulster Unionist
                Members that they were breaching their election commitments that
                they would not allow bodies to be set up on an all-Ireland basis
                which had Executive powers and which would not be accountable
                and also that they would not let Sinn Féin into the Executive.
                Again, because of the Initial Presiding Officer’s ruling, we
                were denied the opportunity to do that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We would certainly have responded to
                gibberish from the First Minister (Designate) about the DUP’s
                position vis-à-vis Sinn Féin in the Executive. Sometimes I
                wonder who will get him first, the men in white coats or the men
                in grey suits. What he argued was the DUP’s position was not
                remotely close to it. Our position remains the same: we will do
                everything in our power to stop Sinn&nbsp;Féin getting into an
                Executive. When the Ulster Unionist Party capitulates the
                circumstances which the First Minister (Designate) mentions,
                come into play.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For any parliamentary Assembly to function,
                there should be some degree of honour and trust in the business
                managers of the Assembly. Following remarks made by
                Mr&nbsp;Wilson during a Committee to Advise the Presiding
                Officer meeting, it is clear that we cannot have that degree of
                honour and trust. Indeed, he indicated that no matter what he
                agrees with other parties he reserves the right, if it is
                politically expedient to his party, to use Standing Orders to
                violate that agreement. Members have heard the same kind of
                comment from Sinn Féin Members, who suggested that they do not
                feel bound by agreements that they reach.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I think your difficulty is at the very heart
                of the problem. The debate was curtailed on 18&nbsp;January
                because they do not like hearing arguments that do not come from
                their own party. The Initial Presiding Officer’s decision was
                one that denied free speech.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should ask why the Ulster Unionist Party
                put the Initial Presiding Officer in that position. Could they
                not find Members prepared to support what the First Minister
                (Designate) had put forwad in his report? That is certainly
                possible. Or could they not hold the line? I saw some evidence
                of that as the DUP often talks about paramilitary beatings. I
                saw parliamentary beatings taking place during that day when the
                political cudgels were being wielded against their Members
                because they were not coming into line.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of course, the fear was that, as the debate
                continued, Members would hear the arguments and Whips would be
                unable to keep them in line, which they were clearly struggling
                to do. Another fear was that they would find out that Mo Mowlam
                was going to use the motion to proceed with the setting up of
                structures. The last thing they wanted was for the public to
                hear the arguments. Other parties should be very careful — the
                rights that they trample on today are the same rights that they
                will seek in the future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the future, I am certain, some Members
                will say our rights have been trampled on simply by the exercise
                of a majority voting in one direction or the other. That is why
                we have a Presiding Officer who is given discretion to safeguard
                the rights of minorities in the Assembly. Therefore there were
                two principal reasons — <i>[Interruption]</p>

                necessary to table the motion for two reasons. First, we sought,
                procedurally, to restore the amount of time which was denied to
                it. On 18&nbsp;January we made it clear, through points of
                order, that procedures are a two-edged sword. Today all those

                made their maiden speeches today. They showed excellent
                potential. We have shown that procedural devices can be used to
                ensure that our rights are maintained.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, we wanted to ensure that no
                precedents would be set by the Initial Presiding Officer’s
                ruling. His ruling was manifestly wrong. However, as
                Ms&nbsp;McWilliams said, everyone can get it wrong sometimes.
                The greatest act of courage is when people admit that they got
                it wrong. It has been made clear that, procedurally, such a
                ruling would be unacceptable in any other democratic
                establishment. The Initial Presiding Officer should reconsider
                this matter and ensure that what happened is not used as a
                precedent.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some almost personal references were made in
                relation to the Initial Presiding Officer. More than anyone in
                the Assembly, I could be said to have a gripe against the
                Initial Presiding Officer for he has contested my East Belfast
                constituency on many occasions. We have met each other on the
                hustings many times. Throughout that period of election
                campaigning we have never fallen out on any of the issues. Many
                Members will agree that he has fulfilled his role in a competent
                manner during his tenure as Initial Presiding Officer. That
                should be acknowledged.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If a wrong precedent is set early in the life
                of a democratic institution, it may continue throughout the life
                of that institution.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the light of the debate, I urge the
                Initial Presiding Officer to reconsider his ruling. On that
                basis, I beg leave to withdraw the motion.</p>

</font><font SIZE="3">
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We touched on this problem when the Minister, Mr&nbsp;Murphy,
attended the Assembly to discuss the question of the public expenditure survey.
On that occasion grave concern was expressed — on a cross-party basis — at
the speed with which it was proposed to change the status of the Belfast Harbour
Commissioners. And, with that change of status, of course, there would also be a
change in the disposal and use of the assets belonging to them.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On 12 October last I was informed on good authority that
terms of reference for total privatisation were put to the Department of the
Environment and the Department of Economic Development by the Harbour
Commissioners, that there would be a short consultative period and that a button
could be pressed and the privatisation would go through by Christmas.
Fortunately, the exposure of that particular process has nullified it, and we
now have the opportunity to properly consider how best to deal, in the future,
with the tremendous asset that the Belfast Harbour Commissioners manage on our
behalf.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are two aspects to the problem. A substantial amount of
Northern&nbsp;Ireland’s commerce passes through this port, and it is important
that we preserve its status and availability for the good of the general public.
Second, its asset resources, in terms of the extremely valuable land that lies
virtually in the centre of Belfast, must be developed in the best way possible,
not just for the people of Belfast but for those in the whole of the North of
Ireland. As well as their assets there is, of course, the question of the
considerable cash resources which are currently at the disposal of the Harbour
Commissioners.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have another concern in respect of the proposals coming
from the Commissioners. How will the other trust ports in Northern&nbsp;Ireland
be affected — those at Derry and at Warrenpoint? Larne is already a privatised
port.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another shared area of concern is the problem of the transfer
from trust port status — a semi-public, semi-private situation — to total
privatisation. The transfer was to take place by way of what is known as a
placed flotation. In other words, a selected body of share dealers would be
asked to place the shares in the hands of those they thought would be best to
manage it. Unlike BT, NIE and others, there was no question of the people of
Northern&nbsp;Ireland being given the opportunity to participate in the
privatisation. This was to be a placed flotation, a new cartel created to manage
the Port of Belfast.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many of us made rapid conclusions as to where those shares
would be, as to who would be involved, and as to where the resulting new
millionaires would come from. For that reason I expressed, on behalf of my
party, concern to Mr&nbsp;Murphy when he addressed the Assembly and,
subsequently, on several occasions in the House of Commons and elsewhere.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is interesting to note that the process was galloping
along at an enormous pace. It started in 1997, and by May&nbsp;1998 the Harbour
Commissioners had already put a transfer scheme to the Department. We are
nearing the end of that process, which was allegedly a process of consultation.
However, I have yet to find any meaningful consultation that took place with the
political parties, the Port Users Association or anyone else. Now a block has
been put in that path and it is now open for full and proper consultation. The
decision which was to have been made by the &quot;push-button exercise&quot; by
the Department and the Minister has now been aborted. Now the process will be
carried forward only after full consideration by the Assembly and by all those
who have an interest in the matter.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The great problem and the alleged urgency at the time was due
to the fact that some major road schemes affecting Belfast, Derry and Newry were
based on the instant sale of this enormous asset belonging to the people of
Northern&nbsp;Ireland.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The much vaunted publication of May&nbsp;1998 from the
Chancellor of the Exchequer stated that Northern&nbsp;Ireland would get an
additional £130&nbsp;million. Please read the small print. Of that,
£100&nbsp;million was our own assets, namely, Belfast Harbour Commissioners. A
bit of creative bookkeeping was involved in that particular exercise, but that
is not the way that it should be done. It is not for me to put proposals on how
it should be done, but simply to flag up some further considerations.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How should the port be managed in the future? Should it be
public, private or a combination of these? How should the revenue of the port be
disposed of? At the moment it is entirely for the use of the Port Users
Association. Could it be used for other projects such as roads, hospitals or
schools? How should the very valuable land and real-estate assets be marketed?
Should it be piecemeal, lump sum or should it create its own market?</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The marketability of the leaseholds and freeholds has been
enormously enhanced by the considerable funds brought into the Laganside
development through the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF). The calf has
already been fattened by that funding. It is important that all the people of
Northern&nbsp;Ireland should benefit, not just the property developers and the
proposed millionaires. It is important that the fatted-calf syndrome that we
have seen with other privatisations should not be allowed to occur in this case.</p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCartney:</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the Member confirm, for my benefit and, I am sure, for
the benefit of others, that if substantive power is transferred on
10&nbsp;March, as is suggested, the Assembly will be in a position to say
&quot;Yea&quot; or &quot;Nay&quot; to any privatisation, or will that power
remain within the Northern&nbsp;Ireland Office or the Westminster Government?</p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGrady:</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The hon Member makes a very valid point, and I am sure his
legal expertise makes him better qualified to answer the question than I am.
However, the political answer to the question — never mind the judicial one
— is yes. If powers are transferred and devolution takes place, then,
presumably, the Minister and the Executive would have the ability, with the
consent of the Assembly following debate, to take what action they felt
appropriate.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is why it was important that the Minister was not
allowed to proceed with the push-button exercise that commenced last December.
Now the Assembly can have its say.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members should also be aware of the grave concerns of the
Port of Belfast Harbour’s trade-union side, which is most strongly urging the
Assembly to take cognisance of potential employment problems in the harbour
precinct if the current proposals proceed. There are many ways in which this
issue can be handled. I do not want to be dogmatic about how it should be
handled — I have my opinions, and other Members will have theirs. This asset
is huge and has great potential benefits for the years ahead, and if Members
want to use the income for other purposes, it is important that they be fully
and carefully considered.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is for this reason that Peter&nbsp;Robinson from East
Belfast and I have jointly framed this motion to allow a Committee of the House
to be established. The Committee’s composition will be proportionate to the
strengths of the parties in the House, and the Committee will undertake,
extraordinarily, a full, public examination of the pros and the cons of the
debate. I hope that after taking public and other evidence, a report can be
presented to the Assembly for debate, amendment and ratification — one that
will arrive at a resolution which will be of the greatest benefit to the
greatest number.</p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Robinson:</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is essentially a business motion and, as such, is not
normally debatable. As movers of the motion, we appreciate the opportunity to
outline the case for setting up the Committee for the purpose stated in that
motion.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are almost 2000 acres of land at the Belfast port, and
that is a very considerable area. Much of it is a very valuable asset indeed.
Those Members who are going to be on the Ad Hoc Committee should be warned at
the outset that they will have very considerable briefing made available to
them. Dr&nbsp;Stephen&nbsp;Donnelly, who is assisting the Assembly with
research, has already prepared a volume for the Committee to look at, and that
is just the independent research that we have had carried out. Members can be
certain that witnesses will bring forward very significant tomes as well.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Colleagues and I visited the harbour towards the end of
last week. Those Members who had not seen it before were impressed by the scale
of the operation and by how profitable that operation is.</p>
<i>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.30 pm</p>
</i>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are talking about a business that has a 50% profit ratio;
a business that has £20&nbsp;million in the bank; and a business which is worth
much more than that in terms of the capital assets that it has at its disposal.
This is a very important issue for Northern&nbsp;Ireland and further importance
can be attached to it because of the position that the port of Belfast has in
terms of the life of the Province. Fuel oil, coal, grain and foodstuff all come
through Belfast, and the depth of the channel means, effectively, that it is the
only place in Northern&nbsp;Ireland where they can come in, so it is vital that
the port be under responsible control.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is vital too that whatever the future pricing policies
are, some restrictions are placed on it. It is, therefore, an appropriate
subject for the Assembly to investigate. What made me put down this motion
jointly with the Member for South Down is the fact that the Harbour Commission
was beginning to take a lead in terms of the consultation process.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Harbour Commissioners would have been controlling the
process: bringing in the parties to speak to them; talking to the trade unions;
and talking to others. There is no reason why they should not do all of that —
indeed, they should be encouraged to do that — but that should not be the
principal method by which the Assembly decides how to deal with this matter.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGrady is absolutely right. If powers are devolved to
Northern&nbsp;Ireland, this will clearly be a transferred matter and, therefore,
the responsibility of the Minister of Regional Development to bring forward
proposals for dealing with this matter to the Assembly’s Executive.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly could give or withhold its support for those
proposals, so it is a matter that will be dealt with in a post-devolution state,
and the decisions that we take on these matters will be vital. Members who will
take those decisions eventually should be well-informed, and how better to be
well-informed than by having a Committee which will look at all the relevant
issues and come forward with recommendations.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are a number of possibilities for the disposal. One
possibility is simply a Tory-style sell-off, allowing the highest bidder to take
it with no restrictions at all — very dangerous as far as the future of the
port is concerned.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Harbour Commissioners prefer a public/private partnership
whereby the public — and in this case it would be the new Government of
Northern&nbsp;Ireland — would hold on to a golden share. They would have an
agreed percentage of the shares of the company, and the remainder would be part
of a flotation which, presumably, would provide the funds necessary to pay for
the roads around Toome and elsewhere that have already been identified in the
Government’s expenditure programme.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Government are forcing our hands in terms of the sale of
the port because they have already spent the money in their expenditure
programme, so we have to deal with a number of those realities. The Committee’s
work is vital but perhaps all that it will be able to do is set out the
principles that should guide the Minister when he looks at the matter, and a
number of those issues will come forward from the research that has been carried
out by Mr&nbsp;Donnelly. I wish the Committee well. I will certainly watch very
closely the work that it carries out.</p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Initial Presiding Officer:</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is a business motion and both proposers have been fairly
fulsome in their introduction. There have been one or two requests to speak
briefly, and I am minded to permit them, but I do urge Members not to get into a
habit of full introductions to business motions.</p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms O’Hagan:</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sinn Féin welcomes the opportunity to engage in
consultations on Belfast port. My party was to meet Belfast Harbour
Commissioners today, but the meeting had to be rescheduled because of this
debate.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is wrong to link the sale of the port with necessary road
and transport development, such as the Toome bypass. This is a clear attempt by
the British Government to sound generous, within the Gordon&nbsp;Brown package,
towards the Six Counties while playing one sector off against the other. We are
told that if the port is not sold we cannot have the bypass.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are many compelling arguments against the proposed
sell-off of the vital assets at Belfast harbour; and we do not need to rehearse
them all. Not least is the sale of valuable land, which is both short-sighted
and detrimental to the long-term interests of Belfast port. Sinn Féin is
against the privatisation proposals. It is incomprehensible that a Labour
Government would carry on with the privatisation policies of the previous Tory
Administration.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The proposal to sell the port is short-sighted in the
extreme, especially in view of its considerable assets. The future of Belfast
port needs to be revisited, and the process should be open and accountable. My
party looks forward to such a consultation process by way of public hearings.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat.</p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Taylor:</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have listened to the debate with interest. These are
important matters not only for the City of Belfast but for the whole of Northern
Ireland. There is one issue on which I should like some clarification from the
proposers of the motion. If and when we have devolution in Northern Ireland, and
when the transfer of powers from Westminster to Stormont is completed and
Departments and departmental Committees have been created, the departmental
Committees will have various responsibilities. A departmental Committee will
look into the issue of the sale of Belfast port. Will there be a conflict
between the Committee that we are being asked to create and the pending
departmental Committee?</p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCartney:</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I congratulate those who have moved the motion. It has been
described as one that has the support of all parties in the Assembly, including
my own. It is regrettable, however, that all the parties except mine are
represented on this Committee. It is heartening to know that there is such a
wealth of talent, and that people do not require the services of probably the
only senior practising lawyer in the House. Although I am not to be a member of
the Committee, I would be happy to contribute in any way I can to its work, even
as an adviser.</p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Initial Presiding Officer:</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A question was posed by Mr&nbsp;Taylor. Perhaps it could be
answered in the winding-up speech.</p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Robinson:</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not intend to make a winding-up speech, but I am happy
to respond to the question. The issue is one of timing. As I understand it, the
intention is to complete procedures by June. Even if devolution were to take
place by 10&nbsp;March — and there seems to be some doubt about that — it
would be a considerable task for the Assembly to get its Ministers in place and
get the Assembly Committees up and running.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There may be other priorities such as roads, transport,
water, or planning strategy, all of which would come under the remit of the same
Committee. But that Committee would not have to accept the outcome of this one,
and may present further reports asking the Assembly to look at the matter in the
light of new evidence. The Assembly has the final decision. Having considered
the issue, the Committee would report to the Assembly, which may take a
different view of the matter.</p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGrady:</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to respond in kind to what the Member for East Belfast
has said regarding the question from the Member from North Down. In terms of the
motion, it is an Ad Hoc Committee and has the in-House statutory longevity which
such Committees are inclined to have. I see no conflict there. When the
appropriate departmental Committee is in place the Committee can terminate —
if it has not already done so — or make arrangements for its dissolution. It
was a degree of urgency that necessitated the motion before us.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With reference to Mr&nbsp;McCartney’s point, we are always
appreciative of free legal advice as it is such a rare commodity.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Agnew:</p>
</font></b><font SIZE="3">
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members on these Benches have some difficulty hearing what is
being said. I could only just hear my name being called. I urge you to address
this problem.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Colleagues will be aware, in July the ACE programme that
has served Northern Ireland so well for many years will come to an end. People
of all ages, races and religions and of both sexes have benefited from ACE.
While it is not perfect, the advantages of ACE outweigh the disadvantages. Many
young people have learned skills, obtained qualifications and training. Older
people have learned new skills that have helped them find employment in a
technological age. Communities have benefited from environmental work, and the
massive contribution that ACE schemes have made towards bringing people together
cannot be underestimated.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are supposed to be living in the midst of a peace process,
but, even before the Belfast Agreement, cross-community groups working under ACE
were keeping communities together.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ACE funding has been decreasing. At its height it received
almost £50 million. Now around £30 million only come from the Exchequer to
fund the programme. A few hundred core workers and a few thousand places still
exist in ACE.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Up until last November the Government were saying that they
had no plans to wind up the ACE programme — a programme that employment
consultants from England and Scotland have been studying as a model for dealing
with the long-term unemployed. And who is better at dealing with unemployment
than the people of Northern&nbsp;Ireland?</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Someone, in his wisdom, decided that money could be saved
using the New Deal Programme. Under this benefit-plus scheme all will be
registered as employed. Funding will come from the massive amount of money that
the Government have accrued from windfall taxes. By doing this the Government
can recoup into the Exchequer some £30&nbsp;million, and that is a squalid
fraud on working-class people by a so-called socialist Government.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no better scheme to cater for all ages of those
needing welfare benefits than ACE. Under New Deal one must be under 25. It is
not a better deal, it is not even a good deal. It is interesting to note that
among the first to sign up to New Deal were the large supermarkets — for three
months they can employ cheap labour to fill their shelves.</p>
<i>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.45 pm</p>
</i>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many questions must be asked about the New Deal. How can one
get a qualification in three months? How can such a scheme adequately teach job
skills? Even though those involved in the New Deal will be registered as
employed and, therefore, reducing unemployment, there will be fewer job skills.
This scheme has not been very successful in England. It is important to note
that in west Belfast alone fewer than 70 people are employed under it. Last week
the Deputy First Minister (Designate) was speaking at a conference where he
welcomed the New Deal Programme, I urge him to rethink his position because his
views do not represent those of the people of north and west Belfast.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Training and Employment Agency says that consultation
with ACE providers has taken place. However, there was no proper consultation
— not even with those in the Department who are aware of the situation.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some Members are associated with Farset, which is perhaps the
largest ACE scheme in the Province. Its manager, Mr&nbsp;Jackie&nbsp;Hewitt,
confirmed to me today that nobody had consulted with him. Mr&nbsp;Arbuthnot of
the Training and Employment Agency has said that one third of the Province’s
ACE providers have signed up to the New Deal. Yet the two or three employed
under the New Deal in an organisation like Farset will go if ACE goes. It is a
crazy situation.</p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Shannon:</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does Mr&nbsp;Agnew agree that the ACE scheme helped the
elderly and the disabled and that the ACE scheme helped to create community
care? Does he agree that the ACE groups were involved in many environmental
schemes?</p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Initial Presiding Officer:</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is not usual to intervene in maiden speeches.</p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Shannon:</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I apologise.</p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Agnew:</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was happy to give way because this is something that all
Members can get involved in and should be concerned with. The New Deal only
involves under-25-year-olds. What will happen to those who are over 25? They
will be cast to the wall and forgotten about. That was not the case under the
ACE scheme.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with Mr&nbsp;Shannon’s point about the
environmental aspects of ACE. Those providing work under ACE have developed
important environmental initiatives in their communities.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Arbuthnot’s point was that one third of the
Province’s ACE providers have signed up to the New Deal. Yet the two or three
engaged under the New Deal in an organisation like Farset will go. It is as
simple as that. Its core workers will go as well because the New Deal programme
does not provide for them. It is almost self-policing.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We face a difficult situation. All over the Province ACE
providers are now making arrangements to wind down their schemes. They are now
putting in place a process that will result in the inevitable closure of some of
these tremendous schemes, such as Farset. It is as serious as that.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Training and Employment Agency should cease immediately
the rundown of the successful ACE programme, and allow a period of six months
for proper consultation with those who are providing it. Otherwise, the
consequences of the current policy will have far-reaching implications for both
training and employment in communities all over Northern&nbsp;Ireland.</p>

<p ALIGN="center"><a name="5">Education</a></p>

<font SIZE="3">
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><a href="#top">TOP</a></p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Benson:</p>
</b>
</font><font SIZE="3">
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to speak on the way forward in education. I do not
intend to give a blueprint for future education in Northern&nbsp;Ireland; I want
rather to assess the education system that we have and raise some questions
about the future. Changes in education have been wholesale over the last
30&nbsp;years, and, as a result, stress levels have never been so high among
teachers, pupils and parents. Teachers have never been so overloaded with
administration.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With the birth of the Assembly we have a golden opportunity
to take our decisions wisely. It is time to assess the success and drawbacks of
our current system to ensure that it is the best education that we offer to our
children. We must consult with the people who are the experts in the field —
the teachers. We must assess and ensure improvement in the areas of nursery,
primary and secondary/grammar education. We must consider the provision of
integrated education, and further and higher education must be reviewed. The
administration of education must be assessed.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ideals, however, are only as good as the financial backing
they are given. There has not been an endless supply of capital for education in
Northern&nbsp;Ireland in the past, and there will not be in the future. With our
own Government we must seek to spend wisely on education. Nursery education for
all four-year olds is an objective with which all can agree. This is a target of
the Labour Government and one to be adopted by the New Northern&nbsp;Ireland
Assembly. We are all aware of the benefits nursery education brings in preparing
children for their primary regime.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, in spite of an injection of capital to provide more
nursery places, many parents find that it is a lottery when making an
application for a local nursery school place. Nursery schools are forced to use
criteria which are unfair to many children and can rule out many hard working
tax-paying families who are the backbone of this society. Nursery education for
all must be a priority.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the primary sector one of the most contentious issues is
that of testing with the selection process the most often debated. Assessment
is, of course, crucial to a child’s development. However, will testing at Key
Stage One achieve anything but overloaded teachers with more costly and
unnecessary administration? Teachers need time to get on with teaching literacy
and numeracy. The last Conservative Government’s obsession with all things
science-related seemed to encourage primary schools to put the cart before the
horse. What is to be gained from understanding Archimedes’s principle if an
11-year-old cannot punctuate a sentence properly or check his change in a shop?
Our primary schools are staffed by enthusiastic and dedicated teachers, but they
must be allowed to teach without the burden of unwieldy and unnecessary
administration. This leads me to the culmination of the primary process — the
selection procedure.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Over the years there have been many dissenting voices. The
selection procedure, the transfer process, the eleven-plus or the &quot;qually&quot;
— call it what you will — still strikes fear into the hearts of children and
parents alike. This weekend many families will wait in trepidation for the
postman to bring notification of success or failure.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, selection in some form is the backbone of secondary
education. In successful and competitive nations such as Germany, France, Japan
and the USA selection is crucial. It is the correct age for selection, however,
that is open to debate.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondary schools must be valued and properly resourced, to
allow them to continue to provide appropriate education to the majority of young
people who attend them. Incidentally, I understand that school league tables are
being published today.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Grammar schools in Northern Ireland — often the subject of
debate — provide appropriate and wide-ranging education to the most able and
most highly motivated young people. Grammar schools offer a route to success to
all pupils, irrespective of social background. Surely this is one of the Labour
Government’s most highly cherished objectives.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All pupils of proven ability should have the right to a
grammar school education, and we should strive to ensure that pupils from across
Northern&nbsp;Ireland have equal access to this opportunity. At present, in some
board areas pupils are admitted to grammar schools with grades A, B1, B2, or
even C. However, the largest controlled grammar school in the South-Eastern
Board area, Regent&nbsp;House Grammar School, will accept only grade A pupils,
forcing those with grades B1 and B2 to travel to schools outside the board area
for their grammar school education.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This inequity must be addressed, and there should be
increased financial support for grammar school provision in what is one of the
areas of largest population growth in Northern&nbsp;Ireland.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The promotion of integrated education must be a long-term
objective, if we are to create a truly peaceful and tolerant society. In
attempting to achieve that objective, we must encourage existing schools to opt
for change to integrated status, and to convince them that that is the most
cost-effective and successful way to promote mutual tolerance among young
people. We should, however, be aware that this change can only come about when
the local communities served by these schools support the idea. Therefore, our
immediate objective must be to increase the atmosphere of mutual tolerance in
existing schools, thus increasing support for an eventual formal change to
integrated status.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In terms of further and higher education, the Government are
committed to the creation of a new culture of lifelong learning. That commitment
has already been made apparent in the recent announcement by the Education
Minister, Mr&nbsp;John&nbsp;McFall, of a £39&nbsp;million package for further
education. The Assembly should aim to facilitate the greatest possible access to
continuing education for people in the post-16 age group. We should encourage
the expansion of second chance learning opportunities.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should also consider whether Northern&nbsp;Ireland needs
two relatively small universities, or if we would be better served by a single
multi-campus institution that is capable of competing with institutions around
the world at the highest possible academic level. Together, our universities
have a student body of some 40,000, and that would make a single institution a
significant body on an international level. Our universities should endeavour to
bring education to the people. It should be possible, for example, for a young
mother in Enniskillen to pursue a degree course by means of the Internet and
other resources provided by her local further education college.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly must also address the issue of the
administration of the education system, so that we can provide the best possible
support to our 470,000&nbsp;pupils and students, and ensure taxpayers of value
for money. The present administrative system, which includes nine statutory
bodies and a range of voluntary bodies, is unnecessarily complex. It costs
£16&nbsp;million to run the Department of Education for Northern&nbsp;Ireland,
£21&nbsp;million for the five education and library boards, and millions more
for the associated statutory bodies.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It would be more sensible to restructure the Department of
Education to give it responsibility for all aspects of education, from the
cradle to the grave. There is also a pressing need to address the question of
whether Northern Ireland needs five education and library boards and, thus, five
chief librarians, five chief finance officers and five chief executives — all
to provide a service for just 1,300&nbsp;schools. In addition, we should
consider the cost of supporting the Council for Catholic Maintained Schools and
related bodies.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many principals identify financial management
responsibilities as the main source of stress among senior school management. We
should introduce a system of professional financial management, with qualified
accountants taking responsibility for school finance matters. That would enable
principals to give their full concentration to the curriculum.</p>
<i>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.00 pm</p>
</i>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Such appointments would give confidence to boards of
governors, who often lack financial expertise. To benefit our pupils we must
make the administration of our education system as efficient as possible.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We in the Northern&nbsp;Ireland Assembly will soon hold the
future of our young people in our hands. It is incumbent on us to ensure that we
provide, for as wide a range of people as possible, the best quality and most
cost-effective education in an environment conducive to learning.</p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Initial Presiding Officer:</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Agnew raised the matter of audibility at the back of
the Chamber. You will appreciate that because of the events of earlier today, I
have more of an understanding of how difficult it is for Members on those
Benches to hear. I found myself leaning back and using the hidden speakers
behind the Benches. Some of you will know that this also happens in the House of
Lords. Their Lordships are often criticised for being asleep; they are not of
course asleep, they are merely listening to the speakers behind. I urge Members,
who are clearly not somnolent, to use those speakers, but I will also speak to
our technical officers and see if there is anything further we can do.</p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Boyd:</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sometimes I cannot hear the person in front of me. There is
still a problem with the sound.</p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Initial Presiding Officer:</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When you are at the desks, the covert speakers are not behind
you but in front, on the desks. Those Members who are lying across the desks are
also not asleep but merely listening more carefully.</p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hussey:</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have raised this matter before. Perhaps the microphones are
too high and when Members are looking at their notes, the microphones are not
picking up their words properly.</p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Initial Presiding Officer:</p>
</b>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is some truth in that. I urge Members to throw their
shoulders back and make sure that the rest of the Chamber hears them fully. Some
of the problems are occasioned by Members leaving the Chamber noisily or
conversing with each other. That is rather unfair to Members who are speaking.</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, the much-mentioned Committee to Advise the Presiding
Officer will meet at 5.30 pm in Room&nbsp;152.</p>
