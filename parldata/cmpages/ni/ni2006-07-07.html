		  	<p class="H2DocumentDate">Friday 7 July 2006</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The Assembly met at 10.30 am (Madam Speaker in the  Chair).</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Members observed two minutes&rsquo; silence.</p>
		  	<p class="H3SectionHeading">Assembly Business</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  In accordance with the Northern Ireland Act 2006, the Secretary of State has  directed that the Assembly should sit on Friday 7 July 2006 at 10.30 am to  consider business as it appears on the Order Paper. The Secretary of State has  also directed that the Assembly should rise for the summer recess at the close  of business today and should return on Monday 4 September.</p>
		  	<p class="H3SectionHeading">Secretary of State Motion</p>
		  	<p class="H4StageHeading">Spending Review and Priorities</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  The Business Committee has agreed that a maximum of four hours be set aside for  the debate. The Committee also agreed that the first round of speeches should  be limited to 15 minutes, with subsequent Members being allowed 10 minutes. I  intend to send a copy of the Official Report of the debate to the Secretary of  State.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">I remind Members that a two-minute silence will be <span style="letter-spacing:-.05pt; ">observed across the United Kingdom at 12.00 pm  today</span> to mark the first anniversary of the London bombings. It was  agreed at this week&rsquo;s Business Committee meeting that I should, therefore,  interrupt proceedings at an appropriate moment to announce the period of  silence and to allow Members and staff in Parliament Buildings to observe it.  If a Member is speaking at the time, he or she will be allowed to continue  after the silence with no reduction in speaking time.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">If that is clear, I shall proceed.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  On a point of order, Madam Speaker. At the first meeting of the Assembly I  raised a point of order about the standing of what has become known as the  Ulster Unionist Parliamentary Assembly Group, which purported, at one stage at  least, to be a political party. When might the Assembly expect a ruling on that  issue?</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  As Members will be aware, the Clerk to the Assembly has been gathering  information on this subject. This has now been provided to counsel and I shall  rule on the matter once I have received counsel&rsquo;s further advice. I, like you,  regret the delay, <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt; ">but I want it to be an  absolutely clear decision. Members </span>will appreciate that the issue must  be examined thoroughly.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Motion made:</p>
		  	<p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly notes the results of the Spending Review  2004 and the current Comprehensive Spending Review 2007 and their implications  for the spending priorities for a Programme for Government to be agreed by a  Northern Ireland Executive following its restoration on or before 24 November  2006.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Ian  Paisley</strong>: Madam Speaker, we are surrounded in the Assembly by mystery. We do  not know what is going to happen. We are here because the Secretary of State,  in his benevolence, has permitted the Assembly to meet today to discuss the  comprehensive spending review.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">As a Member of the Assembly representing the people of  Northern Ireland, I feel that the way the business of the Assembly is conducted  from the office of the Secretary of State is absolutely outrageous. All the  parties in the Assembly should have had the right to be consulted about what  would be debated today. No individual party should be able to dictate the  business of the Assembly. We have had dictations right, left and centre &mdash;  especially from the party that is conspicuous by its absence from this House  today.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">The time has come when this House needs to consider its own  sovereignty in regard to the matters in the  Act that set it up. This Assembly has responsibilities and a certain  sovereignty. Listen to the Secretary of State and look at the papers we  eventually receive from him about the conduct of business in this House &mdash; it is  absolutely ridiculous. The rules can change within hours rather than days. This  Assembly must signal to the Secretary of State that if this is the way that he  wants to conduct his business, he can conduct it on his own.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">There is no use pretending that this Assembly has at least  some democracy when it has very little, and indeed would have none at all if  the Secretary of State had his way. I protest and put on record that Members  and parties in this House should be consulted in some way about the business to  come before it, especially when that business is not in keeping with the rules  of the House in regard to the Business Committee or any other Committee that  wants to bring forward business.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">The time has come for us to tell the Secretary of State  that he cannot simply call a meeting of the Assembly, and, a day or two before  it, say, &ldquo;Here is a bit of paper; get on with it&rdquo; and then tell us that on a  certain day we will be out anyway. That must be brought to an end. The tragedy  is that this Assembly meets and seeks to conduct its business while one party that  is much involved with the setting of that business refuses to come to the  Chamber. Yet the Secretary of State insists that other parties attend the  meetings of a Committee that has the authority to bring matters before the  Assembly.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Madam Speaker, I do not want to weary the House or to get  on your wrong side. I do not worry when you make your own decisions, but I  worry when the Clerk whispers in your ear. I was told by an old Member of the  first Stormont Parliament that when one sees the Clerk whispering in the  Speaker&rsquo;s ear one should beware. I see that the Clerk is now getting impatient  and speaking in your ear.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  I have listened intently to the Member, but I would now like to hear him  address the motion.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Ian  Paisley</strong>: In another place we would call this a &ldquo;Dan to Beersheba&rdquo; motion:  one can walk over the whole land &mdash; whether it be holy land or not. The motion  is wide enough for that because it includes everything.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">The most important issue at the present time is the  security of the citizens of this land. Not only are we living in the shadow of  terrorism as terrorists carry out many atrocious crimes, but individuals in the  Province are being attacked, especially womenfolk. That is absolutely  deplorable, and any right-thinking citizen should be alarmed by the lack of  security for the individual. Every day, other matters arise that cause us to  wonder whether there is any real security for the people of this Province.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Tied in with that is the agitation surrounding the marching  season. Some of us think that the great persuaders in this matter are those who  are out to make trouble at various marches. They seem to have so much strength  that if they threaten enough, their threats are listened to.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">A serous matter has arisen in the village of Dunloy in my  constituency. I resent the fact that, at this time, <span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt; ">certain Protestants cannot lay a wreath in their graveyard</span> without being told where they should stand so that they will be concealed  behind a wall. When a country cannot honour its dead in reverence, it is on the  road to anarchy. I feel strongly about that, and about the fact that at that  particular incident, which could have become serious, when there was opposition  &mdash;</p>
		  	<p class="TimePeriod">10.45 am</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  On a point of order, Madam Speaker. What has this got to do with the motion on  budgetary constraints?</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  I imagine that Dr Paisley will come to the financial implications in due  course.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyTextItalic">[Laughter.]</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Ian  Paisley</strong>: The hon Member must have forgotten that policing the Province is  expensive. Vast amounts of money are laid out on that. Mr McCarthy should  recognise that that must interest those who want to represent their  constituencies.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Last year, as this particular parade was taking place,  there was lawlessness and illegal parking of vehicles to deny the Protestant  people peace to remember their gallant dead. Not one person was taken to court  or made to pay the price for that lawlessness &mdash; not one. Now, those who have  been negotiating with the police and the authorities have told me that the ante  is up. Those who got away with illegal acts and lawlessness last year think  that they can go one better this year, and the threat is now greater.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Those matters may not interest the Member from the Alliance  Party, but they interest me and all right-thinking citizens in the community.  There is great expenditure on security. If there were lawfulness in the  country, less money would need to be spent.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">I do not know whether the civil servant who wrote this  motion for the Secretary of State realised that Members could say anything here  today and tie it in to the spending of Government money. Although the Clerk may  whisper in your ear, Madam Speaker, that does not alter the fact that  expenditure on policing must be faced.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">We can go to France, stand at the Somme and see the liberty  that is given to people of all creeds to pay honour to their gallant dead. Yet,  in our own country, those who carry out acts of lawlessness resist that. They  get away with it and nothing is done. That is a sad comment on our land today.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  Does the Member agree that the best way to address many of the serious issues  that he has raised is for elected representatives to assume responsibility for  them; in other words, to have devolved government?</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Does Dr Paisley recognise that the DUP is one of the  parties blocking progress towards devolution, without  which there will be endless hot-air debates here? The DUP, as it did at  yesterday&rsquo;s meeting of the South Eastern Education and Library Board, will take  part in hot-air debates in which it criticises everybody and everything, and  yet will not accept any responsibility.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Ian  Paisley</strong>: The hon Member is himself engaging in hot-air debate. Does he not  know that members of his own party were in  that debate yesterday, and voted with the other elected representatives?  Or does he think that children in need of special payments for their education  should not be treated as they would in any civilised country? <em>[Interruption</em>.<em>]</em></p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">If the Member wants to make a speech, he should make it in  the time given to him. There is no place for <span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt; ">the  people that the Member wants in a future Government</span> of Northern Ireland.  The gunman will not be there, and neither  will the people who carry out criminal activities. Those who are associated with terrorism, from  whatever side of the country, will not be there with my vote, or the  vote of my party.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">The Member may vote for them, and work with them, as he did  in the past. We will not be working with  those people. The way to peace is an utter rejection of terrorist  violence and all that goes with it. I regret that the hon Member has expressed  those views in this debate, because I  thought that he, at least, had sympathy for those who do not want  terrorism in Government.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">This is an important debate, because it deals with people&rsquo;s  lives, their well-being and the well-being of this country. I trust that today,  in spite of all the peculiar circumstances surrounding this debate, and the  strong eloquence of Benches not sat on, the people of Northern Ireland will  know again exactly where the truth lies, and will back that truth with all  their might as the party I lead intends to do in this House.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Birnie</strong>: I  am very pleased that we have been granted this debate. The decree, as it were,  has come down from the royal court, and the peasants have been allowed to have  a discussion about what crops to plant for the next couple of years.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  The croppies are not here.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  Croppies lie down. <em>[Laughter</em>.<em>]</em></p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Birnie</strong>:  Now, now.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">To cut through the convoluted wording of this lengthy  motion, it seems to be saying that Northern Ireland is facing something of a  squeeze on the growth of public spending. That is undoubtedly the case. We had  warning of this in the Budget last December, and no doubt the forthcoming  comprehensive spending review will reinforce the point.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Dr Paisley said that this was a Dan-to-Beersheba motion,  and I suppose that &mdash; to continue the Biblical analogies &mdash; our situation is  similar to the seven lean years following the seven fat years. Beginning in  1999, we have had five or more years of rapid growth of public expenditure;  between 4% and 5% on average annually in real terms. For the foreseeable  future, that rate of growth is going to drop to about 2%. If, as has happened  previously, the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety  continues to get a rapid increase, the  implication is that many other Departments will face either zero growth  or, indeed, reductions in their spending levels.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">The crucial implication is that if one thought that the  previous Executive of 1999-2002 faced hard spending decisions, any returning  Executive this year or at any point in the immediate future will inevitably  face a greater host of spending dilemmas.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">That is the context. In a tough expenditure environ&shy;ment we  have the logic of the comprehensive spending review. To use the jargon, the  review is zero-based: no programme can be taken for granted, and everything  must be justified against alternative uses of funds.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">I wish to turn to some themes that relate to public  spending. Aneurin Bevin, Welsh politician and founder of the National Health  Service (NHS), said that socialism is the language of priorities. Indeed, given  competing demands and scarce resources, all proper politics is about  identifying priorities.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">There is every indication that the public regards health as  a key priority, perhaps even as the top priority. We must continue to respect  that. From our experiences either as constituency representatives or from our  own families, we know about the human tragedies that result from the avoidable  suffering caused by prolonged waiting for operations, or, indeed, the  unavailability of certain treatments in the NHS. Those drugs or treatments are  often available to people who live elsewhere in the United Kingdom. That is the  sharp end of so-called healthcare rationing. Yet we also know that since 1999  the cash available to the Department of Health has enjoyed very rapid growth;  in some years there have been increases of 10%. Money has gone in at one end,  but there have not always been obvious signs of output at the other.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Several years ago, the Wanless Report considered the future  of the NHS across the UK. Wanless reported to the Chancellor that the NHS  should continue to provide free treatment at the point of use and be funded out  of general taxation. However, the report also issued a warning that sudden  increases in public spending on health &mdash; above about 7% annually in real terms  &mdash; were likely to be associated with bottlenecks. Hence, not all the money would  be absorbed in a way that would raise standards of patient care. Our experience  supports that sorry conclusion: spending grows, but waiting lists remain  stubbornly high. Part of the problem is that, notwithstanding the increase in  financial resources, the number of staff who deal with patient care &mdash; doctors,  nurses and other healthcare professionals &mdash; has often grown little, if at all.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">The recent Appleby Report casts further doubt on the  efficiency and effectiveness of the many structures of healthcare provision  that we have in what is, after all, a small Province of only 1&middot;7 million  people. Many will feel that the current  Review of Public Administration (RPA) proposals are an opportunity that  has been missed to streamline administration in the local NHS.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">In education, there is obviously &mdash;</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burnside</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Birnie</strong>:  Certainly.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burnside</strong>:  Before the Member continues discussing education as the second priority, will  he agree that an allocation of money to the victims of terrorism has been left out of the overall funding spend? That  runs across different Departments. Does he agree with other Members and with me  that priority should be given to the victims of violence? They are often  forgotten and pushed from one Department to another.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Birnie</strong>: I  thank my colleague for that point. I agree that there is a need for a  cross-cutting approach to victims, who are so often neglected.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">There is a multi-  million pound demand for investment in the school estate. I note that  the Government seem to have backed off from the public-private partnership  (PPP) route. That is surely not an accident. Public-private partnerships are  similar to a 20-year or 25-year mortgage, and it may be that the early PPPs,  with respect to school redevelopment, did not represent a particularly good  deal for the taxpayer. Many, and not just in my South Belfast constituency,  would like to get to the bottom of the why, how and who of the PPP decision on  Balmoral High School, which was a particularly extreme case of an unsuccessful  PPP.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">About five years ago, the Department of Education entered  into a 25-year arrangement to rebuild that school, which was to have a  500-pupil capacity. The school now has only 200 pupils and is about to close.</p>
		  	<p class="TimePeriod">11.00 am</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyTextItalic">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Wells] in the Chair)</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Any consideration of allocations of public spending should  not only be about how to divide the cake, but about how we can spend wisely in  order to expand that cake in future. Wealth creation must be a priority. In our  comments on the current Budget, my party pointed out its concern at the way in  which the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (DETI) budget was  being cut. An earlier so-called concordat arrangement to adjust DETI and Invest  Northern Ireland spending in line with levels of inward investment seems to  have resulted in year-on-year reductions. Indeed, some decisions that have been  taken on tourist promotion, or, in practice, the lack of it, similarly show a  &ldquo;penny wise, pound foolish&rdquo; mentality.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Levels of R&amp;D spending in Northern Ireland continue to  place us at the bottom of the league. Therefore, we support anything intelligent  that can be done with spending or through tax incentives to boost science and  technology in the region. We remain concerned by the lengthy slippage in the  writing and publication of the regional economic strategy. It will shortly be a  year behind schedule. We are also still waiting, after several years, for the  electricity cost reduction package that then Minister Ian Pearson announced  some years ago.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">When MLAs speak about public spending, the criticism is  often levelled that we are swift to present the begging bowl but slow to  suggest ways in which to save money. I have some suggestions as to how the  output of public money could be trimmed.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  Does the Member agree that, on the anniversary of the London bombings, and  given that the Prime Minister has refused a public inquiry into that outrage on  grounds of cost, it is a matter of grave concern to learn of the escalating  costs of the Bloody Sunday inquiry, which a member of the Cabinet now estimates  at approaching &pound;400 million? Does he agree that that clearly represents a  considerable drain on the resources potentially available to both the Exchequer  and the Northern Ireland block grant?</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Birnie</strong>: I  thank my colleague for that point. It is an interesting comparison.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>: I  can inform the hon Member that the figure of &pound;400 million that Tessa Jowell  quoted was a complete aberration. She does not know where she got that figure  from, nor does anyone else in the Government. The figure is &pound;163 million.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Birnie</strong>: I  submit, Mr Deputy Speaker, that, even if it is &pound;150 million or &pound;160 million, or  &pound;250 million as other sources have quoted, that seems a very large outlay of  money for an inquiry that has satisfied very few people.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Birnie</strong>: I  want to ask some questions about the so-called national stadium. Is its  business case robust? The Department of Finance and Personnel and the Strategic  Investment Board have so far refused to publish the business case and the  economic appraisal. Will the necessary infrastructure be provided to make the  stadium accessible, wherever it happens to be built? What will be done to avoid  any ongoing subsidisation charges on the public purse? Surely one way ahead  would be to maximise the private sector&rsquo;s role in the project. That would reduce  the drain on public resources and ensure that the stadium would be there to  boost tourism and maximise the benefits for Northern Ireland as we approach the  2012 Olympics.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">The RPA is a missed opportunity.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Donaldson</strong>:  I agree entirely with the Member. It is essential that the development of the  Maze site be a public-private partnership. Is he aware that the two  improvements to the major roads infrastructure in the Lisburn area in the past  five years have both been <span style="letter-spacing:-.25pt; ">privately  financed? Is he also aware that the proposed new</span> Knockmore link into the Maze site will also be privately  financed, saving the taxpayer millions of pounds?</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Birnie</strong>: I  am aware that at the moment the so-called national stadium has a budget of more  than &pound;100 million. We should bear in mind the examples of stadia in London and  Dublin, and indeed of Olympic stadia around the world. We could be looking at  substantial cost overruns. We need to consider the detail of any PPP  arrangements to ensure that such overruns are borne by the private rather than  the public sector.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">The RPA is a missed opportunity. The commission appointed  by the Government targeted the 26 district councils, which was arguably a soft  option, rather than deal with the vast expanses of quango-land and the billions  of pounds that are spent there. Sir John Banham recently noted, based on his  experience of reform of county and city councils in England in the 1990s, that  the merging of councils there did not necessarily save much money.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">The architecture of Government Departments chosen in the  previous Assembly in 1999 might have been right at that stage, but it may not  necessarily be so after 2007. If, for example, Northern Ireland follows the  other United Kingdom nations in establishing an environmental protection agency  &mdash; a subject that I know is of some interest to you, Mr Deputy Speaker &mdash; we will  have to look again at the relationship between the Department of the  Environment and the Department for Regional Development. I am sorry for making  that little point.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  No, you are not.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Birnie</strong>:  No, I am not.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">We have argued since October 2002 that the North/South  bodies should remain on a care-and-maintenance basis. We are concerned that the current Budget envisages a large  growth in the capital spend of Waterways Ireland, for example. The North/South  bodies should not be shielded from the general financial stringency facing all  the other Departments.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">This debate will largely focus on spending, but it is  appropriate to mention the associated revenue-raising side. We repeat that  Northern Ireland&rsquo;s tax revenue would be boosted in the long term if the  Government showed much more imagination in  relation to corporation tax, the derating of industry, VAT on tourism  and the fuel excise differential with the Republic. The wealth-creating sector  can be given incentives to grow. This debate  will probably force us all to face the uncomfortable reality that any  return to devolution will not enjoy the best economic circumstances.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. In an earlier ruling, Madam Speaker  indicated that a Member giving way to interventions would have time added to  his or her speaking time. Is that convention to apply today?</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member is correct, but of course it applies only to those who  have 10 minutes to speak. The Members  making the first round of speeches have 15 minutes, and they are  restricted to that.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>:  We all need to recognise the phoniness of the exercise that we are engaged in  this morning. We are supposed to be pleased to have been granted a debate. The  Secretary of State is weaving between two vetoes on whether to grant debates  and the terms on which such debates are to take place. He feels compelled to  humour the DUP by making sure that there is a debate before the recess, but at  the same time he has to convenience Sinn F&eacute;in by making sure that the topic of  the debate is one from which they can be comfortably absent.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burnside</strong>:  Surely the Member has forgotten the third veto. Does he not agree that his  party exercises a veto by refusing to create a cross-community coalition to get  Stormont up and running?</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>:  The SDLP is not the party standing in the way of the successful working of the  Preparation for Government Committee. We are committed to taking forward the  work of that Committee; we have indicated how we would take things forward. All  sorts of people are canvassing all sorts of plan Bs for what may or may not happen after 24 November. We  pointed out, more than two years ago, a way of restoring this Assembly  that would have made sure that both it and the North/South Ministerial Council  could be fully functional, even if the parties in this Assembly would not form  the Executive.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Other parties have not responded to our proposals and  ideas. The SDLP is not standing in the way of the restoration of institutions.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">I mentioned the  phoniness of this debate &mdash; although I do not intend to be drawn into the  difficulties and shenanigans of the Preparation for Government Committee. The  Secretary of State&rsquo;s motion asks us to address the comprehensive spending  review 2007 and asks questions about the spending priorities for a Programme  for Government.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">The main significance for Northern Ireland of the  comprehensive spending review 2007 will be its determination of the overall  increase in public expenditure for the UK and, in particular, how that  expenditure will be allocated across Departments in Great Britain. The main  implication for Northern Ireland is in the Barnett consequentials that it  produces rather than the implications for the budget lines of individual  Departments. Our main interest is the increase in Northern Ireland public  expenditure as a result of the Barnett formula. Northern Ireland Depart&shy;ments  are not direct participants in the comprehensive spending review in the way that Whitehall Departments are. That  is an added phoniness to this debate.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">We should work through the Preparation for Government  Committee to see how far we can agree in advance the broad policy colours of a  Programme for Government. There may be merit in agreeing some of those  priorities before restoration so that parties will have discussed strategic  priorities and recognised the social and economic implications for the shape  and structure of public services. Having agreed those issues before Ministers  are appointed and captured and become fascinated cheerleaders for their  Departments, we will have broadly agreed some priorities.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">In drawing up a Programme for Government we must learn  lessons from the shortcomings of earlier Budgets with their problem of  short-termism, because we were only able to produce budgets year on year; we  produced annual Programmes for Government. We must  produce a multi-annual Programme for Government with real strategic  priorities. To do that we need a Programme for Government that is not  negotiated just between civil servants in various Departments or between  Ministers of various parties in an Executive as a glossy text that can be stuck  beside the Budget.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Instead, with the social partners &mdash; trades unions,  business, the community and the voluntary sector &mdash; we must negotiate a  multi-annual programme that deals with the necessary long-term public service  commitments and which sets out the real patterns of public expenditure that  must be pursued if we are to deliver better public services and economic growth  and allow the private sector and a strong public sector to grow alongside each  other.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">That is the lesson of the economic performance change in  the South, where social partnership has been at the heart of strategic  progress. Social partnership must be based on multi-annual programmes that  create clear frameworks so that everyone knows where they stand and where their  priorities lie. That way, we will not be ambushed with all sorts of  implementation difficulties caused by one  sectoral pressure after another.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Parties could do a great deal now, although, unfortunately,  they have not got their act together in the Preparation for Government  Committee. Too often, business is left to the Secretary of State to determine.  I heard Dr Paisley &mdash;</p>
		  	<p class="TimePeriod">11.15 am</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  Given that the Member thinks that we are engaged in a sham fight, I can confirm  that King William&rsquo;s army appears to be in place; King James&rsquo;s army appears to  be seriously depleted, particularly those  Members with any military experience. <em>[Laughter.]</em> Does the Member  not welcome the participation of the political parties in the Preparation for  Government Committee and see that as a limited form of progress?</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>: I  do not know of anybody on these Benches who has ever had a particularly good  word to say about King James. <em>[Laughter.]</em> Mr Kennedy might still be  fighting that fight, but some of us do not regard ourselves as ever having been  part of that fight, and we do not identify with it.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Dr Paisley complained earlier that things are being  determined by the Secretary of State. Well, that is the way that the parties  are playing it. They are leaving it to the  Secretary of State to take decisions. Some people are happy to hop  between vacuum and veto, and then complain when the Secretary of State takes a  decision. The next minute, those same people try to bend the Secretary of  State&rsquo;s ear about the next decision they want  him to take. Let us get real about our responsibilities. The Preparation  for Government Committee should be doing more work and better work. We want to  see that work continue over the summer.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">We must create a sense of confidence among the parties and  the broader public that restoration is a real prospect. However, the signal  that is being sent out is that the 24 November deadline is not real and that  restoration is not a real prospect. If we can create a sense of confidence  among ourselves, we can then create a sense of confidence with the public. As  we scope the main policy pillars of the Programme for Government, we could  engage purposefully with the trade unions, the business sector and the  community and voluntary sector and reach consensus about the possibilities for  progress.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">We need to examine a  number of issues in relation to the  Programme for Government and the comprehensive spending review. In the past, all parties in this Assembly have  recognised that there has been a capital expend&shy;iture deficit with a cumulative  effect on our poor infrastructure and poor public services. In the devolved  Assembly, we placed a greater priority on a stronger capital expenditure  performance. That is an absolute imperative. We must increase the scale of our  capital expenditure and improve our performance.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">The Strategic Investment Board has a role to play in  delivering that. Direct rule Ministers have not mandated and structured the  board in the best way. We had other plans, including ensuring that the board  would be a social partnership body, not simply made up of people who supposedly  had expertise in private finance. It would have included people from all the  social partners who had real knowledge and under&shy;standing of public sector  needs, and of the needs of people who rely on public services. It would have  taken on board the insights of people who are skilled in delivery, as well as  the ideas of people who can come up with good financing solutions, to ensure  that we had a strong investment portfolio across our infrastructure and public  services. More must be done about the strength of our capital expenditure.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">We need to map out in greater detail the equality impact of  our public expenditure and public-sector activity. It is interesting that  Government are responding so alertly to the case for special funding measures  for loyalist areas.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Some of those measures are worthwhile and are welcome.  However, the Government, and direct rule Ministers in particular, have failed to respond to the fact that counties in  the west and south of this region show up on maps produced by the Equality  Commission as having the worst figures for long-term unemployment and as losing  out with regard to employment, the distribution of new jobs over the last five  years, and the location of Government jobs and public-sector activity.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">If the Secretary of State is serious about the scale of our dependence, in GDP terms, on public-sector  activity and public expenditure, and having accepted that those maps are  pretty stark pictures of inequality, then he must recognise that Government  decisions have a lot to do with that. That is why Government reform programmes  currently under way, including Workplace 2010, need to be tested for the  creation of opportunities for decentralisation and for a greater equality yield  and a greater equality outcome across the region.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hussey</strong>:  Does the Member agree that in the areas he refers to in the west, the issues  apply equally to the Protestant community as they do to nationalists?</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>: I  referred to counties as a whole in the west and the south. I did not make any  other distinctions. The maps in the Equality Commission&rsquo;s booklet are very  stark and clear. Decentralisation is in everybody&rsquo;s interest, and that was  reflected in this House during the period of devolution. All parties were  concerned to see decentralisation. Workplace 2010, however, is going ahead with  very little regard for decentralisation opportunities &mdash; opportunities for  relocation and redistribution of Government-derived employment.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Other spending issues that we need to address in the  context of the Programme for Government are the implications of the continued  drop-off in EU funding. There will be Peace III funding, but it will not be as  much as previously, and other EU funding will be dropping off. That is why funds  such as the Executive programme funds, abolished by direct rule in the  comprehensive spending review of 2004, must be restored.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">The Executive programme funds were to be our home-grown  version of European funds. We also need to ensure that Departments do not just  assume that the money is theirs to do with  as they wish, and to scrutinise again the need for each Department to  have its own separate establishment or separate support. There should be far  more shared services and shared support across Departments. That will reduce  the costs of individual Departments and do more to reduce the cost of  Government than a reduction in the number of Departments.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">We remind other parties that at the time of the review of  the agreement in 2004, and at Leeds Castle, we proposed a number of changes to  the workings of this Assembly. We proposed new Committees in the style of the  Public Accounts Committee, with one focusing  on the cost of government, that could interrogate any Department on its  administrative costs and on its budgeting. Similarly, we proposed that there  should be a Committee to deal with the effectiveness and performance of  different policies.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">All of those Committees would have been supported by the Northern Ireland Audit Office, but this  Assembly would have provided a strong role in respect of accountability  and scrutiny, a role that the Department of Finance and Personnel cannot  provide. People think that that Department polices the spending of other  Departments &mdash; it does not.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: As  other Members have said, today&rsquo;s debate is clearly a complete farce. However  seriously matters are taken in this Chamber, we know that this debate was set  up for one reason only and that the person who instructed that it should happen  will take no notice of what we say.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Had the Secretary of State been serious, he would have  taken notice of the Business Committee. Four times the Business Committee has  asked for a debate on the Review of Public Administration (RPA). I understand  that four out of five parties agreed that, yet the Secretary of State did not  give us a debate on the RPA, which is clearly the wish of the majority of the  Members of this House. Nor did he ask us to debate the work, so far, of the  Committee on the Preparation for Government.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Instead he set up this debate, as has been mentioned  already, to try to get round the Sinn F&eacute;in version of the veto by giving it a  motion that was not what unionists wanted and to try to get round the DUP veto  on the setting-up of subcommittees. It does not suggest that it is a good recipe  for engagement on serious issues.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Work was done in the Committee on Preparation for  Government that would have merited teasing out further in the Chamber. S&eacute;an  Farren and Alan McFarland &mdash; who currently hold the joint gold medal, possibly  the world championship, for hours attended at that  Committee &mdash; could have contributed significantly. However, without all  parties present in the Chamber, it is not likely that we will get much from  that. The very absence of Sinn F&eacute;in in its entirety from the debate calls into  question whether it is truly interested in working for the restoration of  Government.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Let us look, on the other hand, at an issue on which we  indeed had all-party agreement, and not just four-party agreement, but  five-party agreement: industrial derating. There was clear consensus in the  business community that, in light of the competition presented by the Republic  and our inability to vary corporation tax, industrial derating needed to  continue. When that opinion was put to the Secretary of State, he took  absolutely no notice. It is clear that what we say inside or outside the  Chamber, even when there is five-party agreement, is having no effect on the  policies of the Secretary of State.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">That may explain the low attendance today: it is not only  one party that is absent. Many Members have constituency business on a Friday,  and others will have thought the holiday  period had begun. For the Secretary of State to propose a serious debate  on a critical issue on the last available day does not suggest that he is  taking the Assembly seriously.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: If  he continues with that level of &ldquo;ad-hocery&rdquo;, the quality of debate will be  affected, because no one can prepare properly without notice. The level of  engagement on the bread-and-butter issues, which the Secretary of State says  are important, will be so low as to be  non-existent. The value of plenary meetings is being devalued, not by  those of us who are here engaging, but by the Secretary of State in the way he  is setting things up.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Not only does he not want to hear our opinions on economic  and social matters; he is playing party power games. That is what the debate is  about today. It is a massive missed opportunity. The comprehensive spending  review merits discussion in a much more meaningful way than this opportunity  affords. It should not have been in a cobbled-together debate, at short notice,  and purely for image; not the image of the Assembly but of the Secretary of  State, showing his machismo and power in telling us to get on with work.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">There is much that  needs to be said about investment in hospitals, community health and  social services, and schools and colleges; about environmental protection and  building sustainability in supporting industry and agriculture; about improving  the infrastructure and social capital of people in Northern Ireland; about  reducing crime. However, I will confine my remarks to one area that is sadly  lacking from the comprehensive spending reviews of both 2004 and 2007, and  which was almost ignored in all recent Programmes for Government. It is  nevertheless supposed to be a key policy of this Government: building a shared  future.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Much of our discussion about the spending review is  inevitably on where the money should be spent. A shared future, alongside proper investment in community  relations, would release significant sums of money that are currently wasted on  segregation. A couple of years ago, the Alliance Party got some low-level  research done, as a result of which we estimated that &pound;1 billion per annum &mdash;  roughly 10% of the Northern Ireland budget &mdash; is wasted on the cost of  segregation. Last September I heard Mitchell Reiss, speaking on behalf of  President Bush, give the same figure. I presume that the US Government have had  some additional research done &mdash; I cannot imagine that they depend entirely upon  our view. The Northern Ireland Office is also commissioning detailed research  on the question.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">If we are wasting that amount of money, the way in which we  recover it and put it to good use is a huge issue for the public purse. We cannot  continue to run services in that way, and we cannot continue to fund such  segregation with all its human and financial costs. The &pound;1 billion does not  include the loss of inward investment, nor does it include the tourism that is  lost due to ongoing instability.</p>
		  	<p class="TimePeriod">11.30 am</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">I have heard Orange Order spokesmen give estimates about  how much revenue is generated by tourists coming to Northern Ireland to see the  12 July celebrations. However, I would love to know how much money is lost  every year during July and August due to those celebrations, because when I go  to the airport far more people are leaving than arriving &mdash;</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burnside</strong>:  The Member obviously does not understand that people in the Province have  always gone on holiday during the traditional Twelfth fortnight. He should  attend some orange parades; then he would realise how they can be turned into a  great tourist attraction for this country. The Member should stop playing down  the tourism industry, which has done extremely well in recent years.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  was not playing down the tourism industry: it has done extremely well against  the background of street violence that has driven people away. If we seriously  addressed the costs of a shared future and considered what that &pound;1&nbsp;billion  could do, we could completely negate the effects of the proposed &ldquo;tap tax&rdquo;. We  could make huge differences to our overall public expenditure by redirecting  money more efficiently, by providing more quality services and by preventing,  in many cases, two sets of second-rate services rather than one set of decent  services.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Recently, the Government gave priority to the costs of the criminal justice system &mdash; the costs of  maintaining the rule of law &mdash; yet little priority has been given to  recognising the fact that, in many cases, community relations budgets have been  cut by district councils and bodies funded by the Community Relations Council when the costs of dealing with violence and  maintaining the rule of law, whether in Whiterock or Ardoyne, have to be  met.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">In my constituency of South Antrim two schools beside each  other are to close; one is controlled and the other is maintained. The North  Eastern Education and Library Board is proposing a major capital investment for  the controlled school. In the other controlled secondary school in the town &mdash;</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  Why is the Member in favour of integrated schools, which take a large amount of  money from the controlled and maintained sectors?</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  am grateful to the Member for helping me to make my point.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">In the case of the controlled secondary school, the North  Eastern Education and Library Board is not proposing the necessary renovation  of the other controlled secondary school but the renovation and expansion of it  to cater for the additional pupils. At the same time, the board is faced with  significant costs in transferring pupils from the maintained school, which  faces closure, to a maintained school in Randalstown, which is five miles away.  A local parents&rsquo; group is seeking to establish an integrated college with a  building that could adequately cater for the needs of an integrated school.  That would make more sense than expanding an existing school that would  maintain segregation and put children on buses to take them away from their  hometown.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">There is a clear financial argument in support of  integration, which would deal with some of the problems that the North Eastern  Education and Library Board faces and which are being exacerbated by the  proposal to close two schools. That situation is being replicated in towns and  villages across Northern Ireland. A fully integrated school will not  necessarily be the entire model, but, in many places, an integrated school or  shared facilities will save significant capital sums. We have to accept the  reality that we cannot maintain segregation &mdash;</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyTextItalic">(Madam Speaker in the Chair)</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  With regard to the Member&rsquo;s point about saving serious capital sums, Balmoral  High School in South Belfast is a case in point. It was built at a cost of &pound;15  million under PPP, and substantial amounts of land were given over for  development.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">That PPP failed because Malone Integrated College was built  closer to the catchment area. Pupils who go to that school get free bus travel,  whereas children attending Balmoral High School do not. The result is that Malone Integrated College has taken away  Balmoral High School&rsquo;s pupils, and we now have a school that has failed  and cost the taxpayer something in the region of &pound;15 million. Those sums do not  add up.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  do not see how failing to recognise the demand for integrated education in  south Belfast and proceeding with the extremely expensive PPP scheme for  Balmoral High School was necessarily in the interests of either the children of  south Belfast or those who pay the costs. That is not an argument against integrated  education; it is an argument for those who make  the decisions having a rational plan that considers all educational  sectors &mdash; maintained, controlled and integrated.  I have been pressing the last three education Ministers to do that in  Antrim, and it has clearly proven to be necessary in south Belfast. However, I  thank the Member for adding to my case. <em>[Laughter.]</em></p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">It is a simple reality that many of the most popular  schools in Northern Ireland are integrated. That is certainly the case in my  constituency: one of the smaller controlled primary schools is now the second  most popular in Antrim town because it is integrated.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: Is  this another intervention?</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  It is if the Member so wishes.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Does he agree that in talking about capital, one of the  advantages of the integrated scheme about which he eulogised this morning is  that it invariably brings a brand new school to an area? It brings not only an  educational facility but a building that has the latest and most up-to-date  equipment that a school could ask for.  Therefore does the Member agree that that building is attractive to  parents and teachers?</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">However, is he asking us to opt for integrated education on the basis that the schools that he  mentioned would be part of a merger? They would be part of a merger that  had not been given a new building &mdash; they would  have to settle for second or third best. They would also have to settle  for the old crumbling building that has no room for new equipment. Is that  fair?</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>:  Will the Member give way? I will not have time to respond.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  Having been obliged to give way, I am asking whether is it fair that integrated  schools &mdash;</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>:  Given that my time is limited, how long can interventions go on?</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  Unfortunately, Mr Ford, if you have given way, that is up to you.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  Thank you, Madam Speaker.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Is it fair that integrated schools use the capital to build  new schools? The Member is asking us to settle for crumbling schools in areas  in which he does not want schools to mature.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>:  Clearly, Mr McNarry was not listening to my point. Specifically in the context  of secondary schools in Antrim, I said that there was the potential for a new  integrated school in one of the redundant school buildings.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">I had the pleasure to be recently nominated to the board of  governors of Round Tower Integrated Primary School, having previously been on  the management committee of Spring Farm School when that was established.  Spring Farm School is approximately 28 years old, has had no major renovations  in that time, and is extremely popular because of the quality of education that  it provides.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  On a point of order, Madam Speaker. A very long intervention was made during Mr  Ford&rsquo;s speech. A person cannot simply get up and make a speech and call it an  intervention. There must be some rule for interventions.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">That is an example of a Member abusing the intervention  mechanism in order to make a speech. The Speaker should give some direction on  that.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  We discussed this at the beginning of this session, and a ruling was made &mdash; I  believe the matter concerned Mr Neeson. The general rule is that Members must  try to be careful not to give way if they suspect that the Member to whom they  are giving way will make a speech. If an intervening Member begins to make a  speech, it is up to the Member who gave way to remind him or her not to do so &mdash;  as Mr Ford rightly reminded Mr McNarry.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Members give way entirely at their own discretion. However,  we did ask Members to show courtesy to those who were speaking. Mr McNarry has  not done that, so I now remind Members that if they ask another Member to give  way, they should consider that that Member has a limited speaking time.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  Further to that point of order, I agree with Mr Maginness. Madam Speaker, I do  not expect a ruling straight away; you might  like to consider it with your colleagues. However, an intervention is  only an intervention if it is very short. If a Member speaks for a longer  period of time, then I suggest that the Speaker should intervene and ask the  Member to resume their seat.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  We will take that point on board. I remind Members that we had a full  discussion about this at an earlier sitting, and Members were asked to do  exactly what Mr Robinson and Mr Maginness suggest. I will discuss this matter  with my colleagues and give a ruling, hopefully in September.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McClarty</strong>:  On a point of order, Madam Speaker. When did the Secretary of State last accede  to a recommendation from the Business Committee?</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  This matter can be decided at my discretion. I will examine it again.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McFarland</strong>:  Further to that point of order, Madam Speaker. My understanding was that when  this matter was discussed previously &mdash; and  my recollection may not be quite correct &mdash; you decided that if a speech  was under 10 minutes and a Member allowed a intervention, he or she would be  allowed an additional minute of speaking time. By the logic of that ruling, an  intervention should last for only a minute.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  I think that I have made myself clear on the issue. The Member is quite  correct; that was the ruling. The discussion arose after Mr Neeson gave way to  another Member who then turned their intervention into a speech. We will  examine the matter again, as Mr Robinson requested.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: On  a point of order, Madam Speaker. Will you also perhaps discuss with the  Business Committee whether asking a question  three times does not go beyond the bounds of normal good manners in this  place?</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  I will look at that also. The first round of Members have now spoken, and from  now on Members have 10 minutes.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  I am pleased to follow the remarks made by the leader of the Alliance Party about  the manner in which the Secretary of State is treating this Assembly. One of  the key elements of any deliberative Chamber, particularly an elected body, is  that it should be master in its own house. It is very clear that in this  Assembly that is not the case. There is a puppet-master outside who wants to  pull the strings.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly should  attempt to regain control of how it  functions, both in the Chamber and within its precincts.</p>
		  	<p class="TimePeriod">11.45 am</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Anyone looking in on today&rsquo;s debate might consider that it  is not well attended. It is outrageous for the Secretary of State to have  announced in the middle of the week that the Assembly would sit on a Friday. It  is not a normal sitting day, and no Member is likely to have assumed that the  Assembly would sit. In spite of what the Secretary of State may think about the  role of MLAs, most have other constituency duties today, dealing with Ministers  and others. That is one reason for the poor attendance. This is not an excuse  for what may follow, but Members have had little opportunity to prepare for the  debate. We were given the motion only yesterday. I hope that people will take  account of that when listening to today&rsquo;s speeches.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Sir Reg Empey</strong>:  Mr Robinson makes a serious point, and I raised a point of order with you on  that very issue at the last sitting, Madam Speaker. Does Mr Robinson agree that  the implication of what he said is that the Business Committee will probably  have to take decisions via a mechanism other than unanimity? The Secretary of  State must let go of the reins and give you, Madam Speaker, and the Business  Committee some real responsibility for Assembly business.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  I agree entirely. At times, all of us will be sore at the Business Committee  for going against our wishes, but if we want to make progress, we must put some  trust in the Business Committee and the party representatives that sit on it.  If Members, who often have conflicting views, are prepared to trust the  Business Committee, surely the Secretary of State should be prepared to do so  as well.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Due to the wide-ranging nature of the debate, I want to  speak about devolution. Before that, however, I want to comment on the  Education Minister&rsquo;s decision yesterday on the South Eastern Education and  Library Board (SEELB). I am not quite sure  where Mr Gallagher was coming from. Perhaps he was not aware of what  took place at that meeting, or of the background to the situation, when he  determined to drag the issue up as a matter of division. It was not a matter of  division to the political parties on the South Eastern Education and Library  Board. All the elected representatives, from the parties that are gathered here  and some that are not, agreed on the issue.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">The background to the problem is that a previous board ran  up an overspend, not because it knowingly spent the money but because officers  of that board had not properly reported to  it on its financial circumstances. Only after they had considerably  overspent was the matter drawn to the attention of the board, and some  personnel changes in the board&rsquo;s officer corps indicate that that was the case.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">However, the Minister is now saying that this board is to be punished not only for a previous board&rsquo;s  decision, but also, in effect, for the decision of officers no longer on that board. The Minister needs to be better acquainted of the circumstances. The  current board should not be punished. Worse  still, vulnerable children, with the most to lose, will be punished by  the Minister&rsquo;s decision.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>:  Does Mr Robinson agree that there is a conflict in the Minister&rsquo;s messages on  this issue? He has referred to the debacle of previous SEELB over&shy;spends. Board  members have all been instructed to scrutinise rigorously all proposals from  officers, yet yesterday the instruction was simply to rubber-stamp those  proposals. Therefore, there is a complete conflict in the messages from the  Department of Education on the responsibility of board members for financial  programming.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  That is right, and it is regrettable, at a time when we are trying to get  greater demo&shy;cratisation, that when there is unanimity on an issue from  Northern Ireland&rsquo;s political parties, the response from Government is to sweep  them to the side and bring in people who  will do the bidding of the Minister.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">I will move on rapidly from that issue, as I am sure that  others will want to make their comments known during the course of the debate.  I want to talk about devolution. Via several interventions, it has become clear  that the SDLP has a somewhat jaundiced view of what might be described as the  &ldquo;blame game&rdquo;.&nbsp; Apparently, anyone who  does not agree with them is to blame. I had always understood that to have agreement  it was necessary to have all parties, or at  least a sufficient consensus of parties, agreeing on an issue. It is not  simply a case of the SDLP saying, &ldquo;We brought out a document, and there is no  progress because you did not agree with it.&rdquo; We could all say that; but it is  not the way to make progress.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">There has been a lot of talk about the Preparation for  Government Committee. The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland set out what  seemed to me at the beginning, at least, to be a logical course &mdash;</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farren</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  Just one minute, please. I am in the middle  of developing an issue. The Secretary of State set out what was to be a  logical progression. There would be a Programme for Government Committee, which  in their terms, would &ldquo;scope the issues&rdquo;. That, apparently, is the trendy term  for attempting to identify what the obstacles were to the return of devolution.  The Programme for Government Committee would attempt to categorise those  obstacles, define them in some way, and bring them forward to the Assembly.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">The next stage would take place here, where each of the  parties would not so much debate the issue, but say where they stood on those  issues and the difficulties surrounding them, and would learn from others who  would do likewise from their party position. By the time the Prime Minister  commenced the negotiating process, we would have scoped the issues, understood  other people&rsquo;s positions and, hopefully, been able to outline that for other Members. We would be in a better position  to look for a way to overcome those problems.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">That is what I understood the process to be. Regrettably,  because of the way the Assembly is being set tasks by the Secretary of State, I  do not believe that the issues are getting a proper airing. That would help us  to move to the next stage of this process. It does no good for the Secretary of  State to issue threats, either about the  financial losses that we will bear if the Assembly dies on 25 November,  or about rigid timetables.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">The parties will not take their decisions based on those  factors. Their decisions will relate to principle, and to mandated positions;  to issues that have been put before the electorate that has endorsed them. As  far as my party is concerned, the issues that block the process are widely  known. They relate to the requirement for accountability,  stability, effectiveness and the operational efficiency of institutions  and structures. That goes to the problems that we have had with the  institutions and structures of the Belfast Agreement.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">We addressed some of those in detail in December 2004. Let  me make something clear: my party did not endorse the comprehensive agreement,  as it contained many proposals that were not the first choice of the Democratic  Unionist Party.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Nesbitt</strong>:  On a point of information, Madam Speaker.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  I will run out of time if I take an intervention.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Unless those issues are properly corrected by legislation,  there cannot be progress. We are happy to outline them in any future debate.  The critical issues are those of completion &mdash; the need for an end to  paramilitary and criminal activity. Those issues cannot be washed away,  timetabled away, or bought away. They are matters that stand before the  electorate. The people outside know what the issues are. If we want to have  stable political structures in Northern Ireland, it is absolutely essential  that we do so on a basis that can last. Those structures must be robust, stable  and workable. That will occur only if we have dealt with outstanding issues.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">We have been going  through groundhog day for long enough in Northern Ireland. Agreements  are reached, but the underlying essential issues are left unresolved.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">We get into some form of  Administration that collapses because of the unresolved issues. It would  be better by far if we took our time to resolve all those issues and ensure  that we build from a firm foundation. We can then  go forward and not have the collapse after collapse that damage the  prospects of devolution in the future.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">I trust that the Assembly will be allowed to debate those critical issues so that it can examine the  problems and the nuances of the  matters that each party identifies as  being important for them. I hope also that the Secretary of State will  trust the Business Committee so that it can  programme debates to allow those kinds of important issues to be  determined and real progress to be made.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">I make it very clear that this party wants to see progress: we want devolution and we want an  Executive to run in Northern Ireland. However, that progress must occur  on a basis that the community can support and one that will ensure that the  Executive will be workable and lasting.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  We have about four minutes left, and rather than ask Mr Jim Wilson, the next  speaker, to start his speech only to have to stop, I ask Members to agree to  suspend for a moment. After the two minutes&rsquo; silence, Mr Wilson will begin his  speech. Are Members happy with that?</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">I will be turning on the tannoy so that my statement about  the silence will be heard all over the Building so that people can observe it  as they wish.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The debate stood suspended.</p>
		  	<p class="H3SectionHeading">First Anniversary of<br>
		  		London Bombings</p>
		  	<p class="TimePeriod">12.00 noon</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  The debate will resume in a moment. I invite Members and all others in  Parliament Buildings, to whom this message is being conveyed, to stand, if they are able to do so, and join me in  observing two minutes&rsquo; silence to mark the first anniversary of the  London bombings.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Members observed two minutes&rsquo; silence.</p>
		  	<p class="H3SectionHeading">Secretary of State Motion</p>
		  	<p class="H4StageHeading">Spending Review and Priorities</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Debate resumed on motion:</p>
		  	<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That this Assembly notes the results of the Spending  Review 2004 and the current Comprehensive Spending Review 2007 and their  implications for the spending priorities for a Programme for Government to be  agreed by a Northern Ireland Executive following its restoration on or before  24 November 2006.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr J Wilson</strong>:  I associate myself with remarks that have been made right around the Chamber on  the fact that the Secretary of State continues to call the tune when it comes to the subject matter for debate.  It would be better, of course, if we elected Members were calling that  tune. We might not agree the same tune, particularly at this time of the year,  but at least it would be democratic.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">I wish to say a little more about that. The motion is one  that was probably totally unexpected. I question its usefulness. Given the wide  gulf that exists between republicans and unionists, only the most optimistic  will believe that a Northern Ireland Executive will be restored on or before 24  November, although we will try to achieve restoration by that date. We will try  very hard. To link that date to the 2004 spending review makes very little  sense.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Why did the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and for  Wales determine that that motion should be debated today? The Business Committee  did not recommend it to him. I have no reason to believe that any party here  recommended it to him, but, if so, I am certainly not aware of the fact.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">The Business Committee made suggestions to the Secretary of  State. It has a long list of motions &mdash; 16 or perhaps more. I shall mention only  a few, but they include the Department of the Environment&rsquo;s failure to meet  European directives. Talking about spending reviews, funding and finance, the  DOE risks incurring heavy fines over our heads as we speak. Post-primary  education is on the no-day-named motions list, as is water charges, local  property tax and assaults on emergency workers. Those are very important  bread-and-butter matters for the people of Northern Ireland.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">There was one other motion on the list, tabled by my party,  and, in case you call me to order, Madam Speaker, this brings me to spending  priorities.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">It invites the Secretary of State to note :</p>
		  	<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;that there is no cross-community support for the  current proposals on the Review of Public Administration as it applies to local  government.&rdquo;</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Any spending review that will, before 2009, have to determine financial resources for a new local  government structure that is fundamentally wrong and which is not  supported by the four parties in this Chamber will in itself be fundamentally  flawed. There is a problem for the Secretary of State. Following a debate in  this Assembly on &lsquo;Draft Planning Policy Statement 14&rsquo;, the Secretary of State  said:</p>
		  	<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;I will naturally want to reflect carefully on the  Assembly debate &hellip; I will take account of the views where there is cross  community support.&rdquo;</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Had there been cross-community support &mdash; and I have  reason to believe that there could have been &mdash; what would the Secretary of  State have said or done?</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">In November 2005 at the Hilton hotel, the Secretary of  State said there would be a quango cull. We know that there was no real cull,  just some tinkering at the margins. He said:</p>
		  	<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;this will cut costs and transfer resources &hellip; to the  frontline delivery of key public services like health and education.&rdquo;</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Does anyone really expect that his proposals would  lead to savings from a cull on quangos?</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">He went on to say that:</p>
		  	<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;the RPA has never been a cost-cutting exercise &hellip;  Nonetheless, I do expect the streamlining of structures to result in significant  savings &hellip; tentative estimates I have received indicate savings of up to &pound;200  million per annum&rdquo;.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">A colleague of mine remarked that, in a lifetime in  politics, he had never seen a review of scale result in savings of any kind.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">In another place, Lady Hermon asked the Secretary of State  what cost savings were expected from the Government&rsquo;s plan to reduce the number  of local authorities in Northern Ireland. David Cairns replied:</p>
		  	<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Savings from the Review of Public Administration  (RPA) decisions on local government have been estimated at &pound;54-&pound;73 million.&rdquo;</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">They have given themselves some scope to get it  right somewhere in the middle, although I do not think that they will even hit  the middle target. Here is the line that needs to be read twice:</p>
		  	<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The final figures will depend on how the proposals  are implemented.&rdquo;</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">The proposed structure of local government is wrong. The  associated savings are wild guesstimates; they are not based on reality. As I  said earlier, today&rsquo;s debate has been an opportunity missed.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farren</strong>:  Like my colleagues in the SDLP, it is with some reluctance &mdash; and having  participated in the Preparation for Government Committee over the past six  weeks or so, considerable disappointment &mdash; that I participate in this morning&rsquo;s  debate. It is not the debate with which I hoped we could have concluded this  session of our business. I had hoped that some progress might have been  recorded in the Preparation for Government Committee. I suppose that having all  the parties in the same Committee room is progress, but that is a very low  threshold.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Instead, as most colleagues probably know from reading the  reports of the business in that Committee, the meetings have been characterised  by a considerable degree of vindictiveness and strident allegations &mdash; almost  personal abuse &mdash; on the part of both the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in. If things are not  done their way &mdash; and their ways are contradictory and exclusive of each other &mdash; matters cannot be progressed in the  Committee. We are, therefore, left with a situation where the Secretary  of State has to decide. It is difficult for a self-respecting Irishman to  accept that our business can transpire only as, when and how the Secretary of  State determines.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">With respect to some of the remarks made by the DUP, since  it is present today, Mr Robinson tried to reject the comprehensive agreement a  few moments ago &mdash;</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  Will the hon Member give way?</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farren</strong>:  Well, you may not have agreed them, but the submission  by the DUP includes an approving reference to the comprehensive  agreement proposals. Among the many conditions heaped by the DUP into their  submission, it seems that it is now ready to accept those proposals. It is not  surprising, since, in the immediate aftermath of the publication of those proposals,  Mr Robinson &mdash;</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Nesbitt</strong>:  I see that both Gentlemen are now back in the Chamber. Mr Robinson said that  his party disagreed with many aspects of the comprehensive agreement. Does Dr  Farren agree that the Leader of the Democratic Unionist Party said that there  was only one element that was not agreed, namely the modalities for  decommissioning?</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farren</strong>:  Mr Nesbitt&rsquo;s memory of what the DUP said is  probably clearer than mine. However, it is clear &mdash;</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farren</strong>:  No, you did not give way to me a few moments ago. May I just remind Mr Robinson  &mdash;</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  Mr Robinson, the comprehensive spending review and the comprehensive agreement  are two different things.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  Madam Speaker, is it not usual protocol in any debating chamber that if a  Member is named he is given the opportunity to respond?</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  You are quite correct.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  I am grateful. May I make it clear that the comprehensive agreement was not  agreed in any part by any party. It was an agreement between the two  Governments, who brought it forward, and was subsequently  endorsed by the United States Government. It was not an agreed document.  We support many aspects of that document, although not particularly in their  present form. We support a range of issues, but the general context is that we  have not yet supported the agreement.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>: The comprehensive agreement appeared as proposals put to Sinn  F&eacute;in and the DUP by the two Governments; proposals which both parties had to  accept before 8 December 2004. That acceptance was indicated. Consequently,  Peter Robinson described the comprehensive  agreement as a remarkable achievement by the DUP. Now he says that the  DUP never agreed or accepted it.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farren</strong>:  May I continue, Madam Speaker?</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">While the shenanigans continue in the Preparation for  Government Committee, we are faced with a situation where, despite the best  intentions &mdash; as we might describe them &mdash; of the 2004 spending review, we still  live in an economy which is considerably unbalanced and seriously in need of  substantial regeneration.</p>
		  	<p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Indeed, over the past two and a half years, all the parties  participating in the Preparation for Government Committee have been meeting  representatives from the Northern Ireland Business Alliance. They have been  preparing a basic framework document on which to base plans for economic  regeneration; all those parties have agreed  the contents of the document. That frame&shy;work document would have been a  more appropriate basis for today&rsquo;s debate. At the behest of the Secretary of  State, subcommittees are to be established; that framework document could be  further developed in one of those subcommittees.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">The Northern Ireland Business Alliance, and the entire  business and social partnership community, must be looking on, with despair and  disappointment, at our failure to progress those issues. At the outset of this  Assembly, just seven weeks ago, the Northern Ireland Business Alliance gave us a detailed presentation, in the Senate Chamber, which was widely and  enthusiastically acclaimed. The alliance expected further work to  progress quickly.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">The establishment of  priorities to underpin economic regeneration will require us to take  greater advantage of the social and economic levers at our disposal and to seek  other levers where necessary. Those levers are in education, training, and  research and development. There are also fiscal levers, such as business taxes,  that we already control and others that we may be able to acquire. No modern  economy achieves success without a strong  investment in education and training, especially in vocational and  technical training, and in third- and fourth-level education. The people who  will lead the research and development of new products and new processes, and  those who will manage and develop new enterprises, are educated and trained at  those educational institutions.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Northern Ireland still  lags far behind other economies in research and development. An  overwhelming proportion of local research is conducted in our universities.  That research has resulted in considerable successes in business applications.  However, we need to address the fact that much of that research does not emanate  from the business sector.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">The establishment of an  all-Ireland research alliance, through a restored North/South  Ministerial Council, would be a key initiative to achieving a more effective  role for research and development. Such an alliance would mobilise the research  facilities and expertise available in all  the universities and colleges of technology on the island and link them  with businesses, wherever they are located and wherever it is appropriate. That  initiative, supported by public funds, philanthropic and research bodies, and  the business sector, should be a strategic priority for restoration.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">A newly established economic development subcommittee  should progress that initiative in order to make our commitment more urgent. We  all made that commitment to the Northern Ireland Business Alliance to show that we are determined to contribute  significantly to economic regeneration.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs I Robinson</strong>:  I cannot let Dr Farren get away with some of his comments. I remind him that  the Protestant community in Northern Ireland feels that it has not had a fair  deal since the 1970s. In 1985, when the Anglo-Irish Agreement was foisted on  us, the unionist population of Northern Ireland &mdash; one million Protestants and  their elected representatives &mdash; were totally ignored. When asked why the  unionist people were ignored, Dr Farren&rsquo;s former leader Mr Hume said that it  was because they would not have gone along with that deal. That comes from a  party that is supposedly moderate and democratic. We do not take lessons on  democracy from the SDLP.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">With regard to the spending priorities, I want to add my  voice to the condemnation of the Minister of Education&rsquo;s actions in forcing the  members of the South Eastern Education and Library Board to endorse the  swingeing cuts that will hit the most vulnerable section of the community &mdash;  children with special needs. I am delighted that those elected representatives  stuck to their principles and refused to rubber-stamp the disastrous ineptness  of the former board members, who failed to  identify the looming deficit of approximately &pound;21 million. Ultimately,  it was the responsibility of the chief accounting officer to draw that to the  board&rsquo;s attention. Sadly, children with special needs will be the main losers  in this scenario if the Government have their way. Unfortunately, the  Government picked independents who are neither accountable nor elected to  represent anyone in our community and who failed to stand shoulder to shoulder  with the rest of the democratically elected board members. They are a disgrace,  and I hope that parents make their views known to them.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">At a time when the ongoing Review of Public Administration  looms, the general view is that there should be more democracy in Northern  Ireland rather than less. Those Government  appointees, who outnumber elected representatives, should be done away  with, and the voices of elected members should be heard. The elected  representatives undoubtedly took the right decision. They took that decision on  principle, and I salute the stand that those members took, including, of  course, the SDLP representative.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">How can we deny those vulnerable children every aid and  assistance that will encourage them to reach their full potential? Our party  will raise the issue in the House of  Commons, and I have sought an urgent meeting with the Minister to include Peter Robinson and Jeffrey Donaldson,  whose constituencies are in the board area. I  can say, without a shadow of a doubt, that the Minister, following my  request and having expelled the  elected members, will not be rushing to accommodate those representatives as enthusiastically as she  introduced the unelected personnel who will deal with the board&rsquo;s  finances from now on.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">With regard to the comprehensive spending review, Health  Service expenditure in the Province will have risen from around &pound;1&middot;7 billion in  1997 to &pound;3&middot;8 billion by 2008. It now accounts for more than 40% of the Northern  Ireland budget. How the Health Service deals with those neuro conditions for  which numbers of diagnoses are rapidly increasing will have significant  resource implications. Those conditions include autism spectrum disorders and  attention deficit disorder, as well as those that result from the impact of  childhood abuse. We are part of an  ever-ageing population: dementia, strokes  and diabetes will use up more and more resources. Trusts are under  greater pressure than ever before with the Minister&rsquo;s tightening of the purse  strings.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">New service development was suspended, and it is proving a  struggle for some trusts to even maintain existing front-line services. The  escalating costs that are associated with providing services will result in  even greater pressures in future.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Government continues to ignore differential need. There is a greater level of healthcare need in the  Province than in the rest of the United Kingdom. The health and social  care needs and effectiveness study that was published three years ago showed  that more than 20% extra spending per capita is required to achieve the same  standard of care that exists in England.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Several factors in Northern Ireland can only add to the  disparity between standards in the Province and those across the water.  Significant extra health costs result from the continuing legacy of terrorism  and community tension in the Province. It costs more to provide services to a  sparsely populated region, and low levels of subscription to private health  insurance results in a substantially greater burden on public finances.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">The Northern Ireland population is growing faster than that  of anywhere else in the United Kingdom. The most expensive patients to care for  are those at either end of the age spectrum. At the same time, 30% of the Province&rsquo;s population is aged under 20 years,  compared with 25% in England, and there are 40% more adults who are  severely disabled in Northern Ireland.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">The respected health economist Professor John Appleby has  recognised the disparity in need. In a recent study, he stated that in an  attempt to calculate future spending for health, a way would have to be found  to bypass the Barnett formula. Appleby also claimed that, compared to that in  England, our Health Service was under-performing and inefficient. For instance, he identified that the drug-prescribing  practice in the Province has led to an unacceptable waste of tens of  millions of pounds. That must be examined, because doctors are writing  prescriptions ad nauseam even though other means might be used.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">Progress on waiting list totals has been made in recent months, but health trusts are under great  pressure to meet Government targets. Sometimes that leads to a conflict  between continuing with elective procedures and dealing with unexpected  emergencies that come in overnight.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">The Review of Public  Administration has the potential to make improvements to health  structures. Health Service reform that speeds up and streamlines  decision-making will be welcomed. A reduction in the number of trusts will  undoubtedly mean savings on the basis of economies of scale. The one thing of  which we can be sure when considering the comprehensive spending review is that  the cost of providing good-quality healthcare will only escalate further over  the next few years. That is why we must take every opportunity to ensure that  the system within which services operate is as rigorous and efficient as we can  possibly make it.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  If Members are content, I shall now suspend the Assembly for lunch between  12.30 pm and 1.30 pm.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The sitting was suspended at 12.29 pm.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyTextItalic">On resuming (Madam Speaker in the Chair) &mdash;</p>
		  	<p class="TimePeriod">1.30 pm</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>: I  hope that the small turnout is not due to the fact that it is my turn to speak,  but I will take advantage of that.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">I wish to address three  issues that feed into the themes of the comprehensive spending review.  The first issue that I wish to address is water charging, which has been with  us for some time. The people of Northern Ireland have been paying for water and  sewerage services through their regional  rates and, as no reduction has ever occurred in the regional rates, one  can safely assume that we will continue to pay in that manner. Water is  essential for life and is a fundamental require&shy;ment of public health. We all  acknowledge that our water and sewerage system has suffered from several  decades of underinvestment by successive British Governments.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">The Government&rsquo;s current proposals remain unfair for a  variety of reasons: The proposed capital value does not take account of the  ability to pay; the proposals do not take account of the amount of water used;  and they do not provide incentives to save water as required by European law.  Focus must be placed on needs in Northern Ireland, rather than comparisons with the rest of the United Kingdom. We are  continually reminded that Northern Ireland pays less for rates and  water, but that is a crude and unfair comparison as Northern Ireland&rsquo;s income  and expenditure profile is different. Developers should pay for the provision  of services to new housing developments. The  Government have conceded that point, but there is still no sign of that  saving being passed on to the consumer. Road drainage costs should be paid by  road users and not by water consumers.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">In Great Britain, the Water Service received a green dowry of &pound;1.6 billion to upgrade its water and  sewerage services. At the same time, it was agreed that &pound;50 million  would be paid annually to Northern Ireland for water and sewerage improvements.  That cash was not ring-fenced and appears to have been absorbed into the pot. We are still waiting to see some sign of the  Govern&shy;ment&rsquo;s peace dividend.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">There are other issues  arising from the Government&rsquo;s intentions. Water charging will commence  next year, and by 2010 the full charges will be applied. Water and sewerage services will then transfer from the  Government to the regulator who will  decide the charges to be levied by the Government-owned company (GoCo).  Some would speculate that the sole purpose of separate charging is to prepare  the Water Service for a quick sale.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">The experience across the water does not provide much  comfort. The water companies wrote-off &pound;960 million in bad debts last year, and  it is estimated that up to 15% of householders consistently refused to pay  their bills. Leakage targets set by the regulator have not been achieved.  Thames Water has applied for an emergency drought order. Those are the benefits  of 17 years of privatisation.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">While I have no difficulty in supporting private industry  as a principle, the Government have left too many imponderables in their plans  for water charges for the project to be a success. The Government must cease their &ldquo;suck-it-and-see&rdquo; approach to this  important matter and return to the drawing board.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">The second issue that I wish to address is the reform of  the domestic rating system.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">The current system of rating has its roots established in  the nineteenth century. Very few Members would have been around at the time &mdash;  although most would have by 1976 when the last revaluation of domestic property  occurred. That assessment was based on evidence emanating from the late 1960s,  and few would disagree that the system needs updating.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">However, the Government&rsquo;s proposal for a new system based  on capital values is again unfair. Basing domestic rates on the capital value  of homes is not a fairer system of  assessment as it fails to properly reflect an ability to pay. Many  householders in Northern Ireland are asset rich but income poor.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">In 1995 the average house price stood at &pound;43,826. It now  stands at around &pound;140,000; indeed last evening&rsquo;s &lsquo;Belfast Telegraph&rsquo; reported  that the figure has now risen to &pound;146,000. This system is not about fairness:  it is about Government tapping into a lucrative housing market and squeezing as  much as possible out of hard-working families. That is a recipe for disaster  for society here, particularly for low-wage earners and the elderly. I  acknowledge that the Government has made some gestures in their direction, but  much more must be done to affect people on low incomes.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">The ratepayer here is already paying far more than  previously. In 1998, &pound;166&middot;5 million was collected from the domestic sector.  Last year &pound;346&middot;8 million was levied, and this year the figure will rise by a  further &pound;20 million. Government seems to be exploiting the political vacuum in  Northern Ireland to impose a draconian system for local government finances.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">On 3 July the Minister of State assured us &mdash; in fact he  emphasised &mdash; that the reforms were not about raising more revenue. Rather, he  said they should make the system fairer &mdash; by sharing the rating burden among  householders &mdash; and easier for ratepayers to understand. I beg to differ on  that.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">My third point relates to Belfast Harbour. Many Members  were alarmed to learn recently that the Government is considering the possible  sale of Belfast Harbour. The Government&rsquo;s document, out to consultation until  22 September, could pave the way for selling off key parts of the Port of  Belfast. The Strategic Investment Board  (SIB) has denied any sinister intent, but it would appear that the  Government might be attempting to asset-strip the Belfast Harbour  Commissioners&rsquo; property portfolio by selling key parts for the benefit of  speculators.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">The Port of Belfast has contributed massively to the economic infrastructure of Belfast and Northern  Ireland for many years. This untimely speculation could undermine the  port&rsquo;s current &pound;140 million capital investment programme. The port currently  handles two thirds of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s sea-borne trade and 25% of that of the  entire island of Ireland.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">I understand that the previous Assembly rejected any  suggestion of a change in status for the Port of Belfast. That was the correct  decision, and any idea of a sell-off is sheer foolishness and shows a total  disregard for the future of our infrastructure.</p>
		  	<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  As well as seeking to make savings in health and education services, amongst  others, Government must ensure that their own house is in order in relation to  financial management and savings. The hon Member the Deputy Leader of my party  referred earlier to the &ldquo;puppet&rdquo; Secretary of State, who would like to pull  strings to operate this House. It is time that he pulled the strings of those  who are in charge of the finances of Northern Ireland.</p>
		  	<p class="B3BodyText">As an illustration of that, and of the necessity to focus  not only on money but on the reform and quality of delivery, let us consider  Northern Ireland&rsquo;s waste management strategy and the report by the Comptroller  and Auditor General for Northern Ireland. I refer to two specific areas.  Earlier in the debate Dr Farren, the Member for North Antrim, told us about the  virtues of cross-border initiatives and all-Ireland institutions that could be  of great benefit to us all.</p>
	  		<p class="B3BodyText">Let us look at one initiative that should have been  dumped &mdash; the fridges fiasco of a couple of years ago. The Department of the  Environment (DOE) negotiated an all-Ireland contract for the disposal of  domestic waste, fridges and freezers, but when the bid collapsed before the contract was due to be signed, some  councils stockpiled fridges, while others waited for prices from other  places. The Comptroller and Auditor General estimates that the delay in putting  the contract in place cost the public purse at least &pound;750,000. That money could  have been better spent on public services, and on front-line services in  particular.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">&nbsp;</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText"><span style="letter-spacing:-.05pt; ">The Comptroller and  Auditor General&rsquo;s report makes</span> even more damning comment about the  Government&rsquo;s good intentions in promoting recycling, which were undercut  because recycling facilities were too often simply unavailable. The Comptroller  and Auditor General notes that the Government resorted to the hiring of a  consultant &mdash; often their first port in a storm. He says:</p>
  		<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;A fundamental cultural shift in attitude and  behaviour is essential to achieving the Waste Management Strategy&rsquo;s&hellip;objectives.  In order to encourage this shift, EHS employed media consultants, in December  2001, to drive a &pound;1&middot;5 million public awareness campaign: &lsquo;Wake up to waste&rsquo; &rdquo;.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText" style="text-indent:0mm;">He goes on to note that because  sufficient recycling facilities and other opportunities for avoiding waste  disposal were not available:</p>
  		<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;these improvements have progressed only to a limited  degree, the success of &lsquo;Wake up to Waste&rsquo; may have been limited, in the short  term, and will be more difficult to maintain, or expand, in the longer term.&rdquo;</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText" style="text-indent:0mm;"><span style="letter-spacing:-.2pt; ">Therefore,  whether one is talking about health, education</span>, the environment or waste  management, we must take an interest, not only in the money, but in the skill  or otherwise with which Government can organise themselves to deliver a  high-quality service to the public who pay for it.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">The Department of the Environment did wake up to waste; it  woke up to the reality that it was time to dump the issue with local  authorities, and to have them incur the costs, so that members of local  councils &mdash; some of whom are Assembly Members &mdash; would have to raise the revenue  and the finance to do what central government should have done.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">When the Northern Ireland estimates for the current  financial year were published, they were accompanied by a statement of excess.  This related to expenditure in excess of the net estimate provision for the  Department of Education in the previous financial year. The excess <span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt; ">expenditure was not an insignificant sum; it was  some&shy;where</span> in the region of &pound;123 million. The Department was rightly  criticised by the Public Accounts Committee for lacking adequate control  mechanisms to prevent the situation from arising. I trust that, to prevent any  such recurrence, the appropriate rules are now in place, not only in the  Department of Education, but in other Northern Ireland Departments.</p>
  		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>:  Would Mr Storey agree that if this Assembly was up and running we would have  our own Public Accounts Committee to scrutinise all the issues that he has  raised?</p>
  		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
  		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  The Hon Member should recall that the failure and the faults of the previous  Assembly created some of the financial crises that we have experienced, so we  should not be begging, cap in hand, for the restoration of the failed  structures of the Belfast Agreement.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">The hon Member earlier referred to the regional rate. It  was the old Assembly &mdash; the failed Belfast Agreement version of this Assembly &mdash;  that brought in a 7% year-on-year increase on the regional rate, and the  pro-Agreement parties supported it in this House. Therefore, the hon Member for  East Londonderry should not be giving any lectures about the restoration of a  devolved administration for the financial good of Northern Ireland.</p>
  		<p class="TimePeriod">1.45 pm</p>
  		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: Mr  Storey criticised the 7% increase to <span style="letter-spacing:-.1pt; ">the  regional rate incurred during the previous Assembly</span>. Is he more satisfied  with the 19% increase that was recently delivered?</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyTextItalic">[Laughter.]</p>
  		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>: The hon Member from the Ulster Unionist Party should also bear  responsibility, because his party negotiated the Belfast Agreement and brought  about the situation in which the 7% increase was introduced.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">The published Department-by-Department figures for the net  administrative cost are interesting and bear some scrutiny. Adding up the net  administrative costs for Northern Ireland Departments for 2005-06 and comparing  those with the costs for 2004-05 and the actual expenditure for 2003-04, there  is a consistent pattern: actual administration costs for 2003-04 were almost  &pound;803 million, rising to &pound;854 million for 2004-05 and &pound;954 million for 2005-06.  Time and time again we hear that Government are committed to cutting out waste,  getting resources to front-line services and doing away with superfluous  administration. However, there seems to be a contrast between their words and  their actions.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">The House needs to pay particular attention to the House of  Commons Select Committee report that confirmed that the level of fuel smuggling  is so great as to warrant a reduction in the tax levy placed on the people of  Northern Ireland. That is significant because a Westminster Committee, weighed  down with Labour Party representatives, has concluded that such is the extent  of the criminal conspiracy in Northern Ireland that it ought to affect the  level of taxation.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">One of the groups most responsible and associated with  those who have threatened and attacked our economy, jobs and investment is the  party that is missing from the Assembly today. Today, Sinn F&eacute;in stands  officially condemned by that report as the public face of pirates, smugglers,  counterfeiters and gangsters. It stands  exposed as hypocritically demanding places in government to help to run  the economy by day and seek to destabilise the economy by night &mdash; to such a  degree that the Select Committee recommends a change in Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  taxation.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">However, one should not be surprised by that. This week, the true face of the abstentionists in the  republican movement has been seen. A Sinn F&eacute;in Member of the House  publicly admitted that he stole flags and bunting in Lurgan, and it was  reported in the local papers. He then prides himself that that was an act of  valour. A more sinister comment from a  councillor in Cookstown shows the true face of republicans. The  councillor determined that the Continuity IRA and dissidents are not hardliners because they have not killed any  Brits yet.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">That says something about the character and the credentials  of the party with which so many in this House are keen for the DUP to sign a  deal. Sinn F&eacute;in does not have the credentials to be in government. It has a  long way to go. With regard to the finances of Northern Ireland, I would not  trust Sinn F&eacute;in with the finances of my piggy bank, let alone the finances of  Northern Ireland.</p>
  		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  The alleged purpose of today&rsquo;s debate is to define:</p>
  		<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;spending priorities for a Programme for Government to  be agreed by a Northern Ireland Executive following its restoration on or  before 24 November 2006.&rdquo;</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">That is an act of political contrivance to mask and conceal  the real political and economic problems that confront all Members and the  wider community.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">Those problems cannot be ignored, and they must be tackled  if we are to achieve a political resolution that reflects the requirements of  all the people.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">This morning, the hon Member for North Antrim Dr Paisley  informed us that this House was surrounded by mystery. Then, the hon Member for  East Belfast Mr Robinson told us that we were not masters of our own house. How  can we be, when the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in refuse to allow restoration to take  place? It is clear what the DUP must do. It  must sign up to a commitment to power sharing and to partnership  government. Sinn F&eacute;in must sign up to the principles of policing and an end to  criminality, as defined by the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee report that  was published this week.</p>
  		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr William  McCrea</strong>: Does the hon Member really believe that the Democratic Unionist  Party can sign up to putting into government those who are wedded to a  continuation of terrorism, criminality, paramilitarism and extortion? Does the  Member really expect us to put those people into government?</p>
  		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  The SDLP firmly believes in inclusion. If we want to move forward, and if we  want, for example, to correct the funding problems presented by the South  Eastern Education and Library Board and counter  its unacceptable introduction of commissioners, the political  institutions must be restored. Both parties must stop protecting their own  territory and get down to the business that the people of Northern Ireland  elected us to do. That is the challenge.</p>
  		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
  		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  I will not give way. We have already been served a diet of that terrible  behaviour in the Preparation for Government Committee. We have been served a  diet of insinuation and cruel insult. The people of Northern Ireland are saying  that they have had enough. They want us to get down to business and deal with  the real priorities. If this was a real debate, we could do that, and be able  to define our priorities. We only have to look at our roads infrastructure. For  example, one of the key objectives of the Department for Regional Development&rsquo;s  corporate and business plan is to: &ldquo; maintain the road infrastructure to keep  it safe, effective and reliable and to preserve the value of the asset&rdquo;.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">We have work to do then. There is extreme concern in the  construction and quarry-products industry, as the SDLP and other parties have  pointed out, that the financial allocation  of &pound;58 million for roads maintenance this year is totally inadequate. To  protect an asset, resources should not be reduced. We must continue to invest  in those resources. Recent statistics have highlighted a &pound;9&middot;8 million reduction  in the budget allocation across the four Roads Service divisions for asphalt  and bitmac resurfacing in Northern Ireland.</p>
  		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
  		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  I will not give way; I have limited time. If the DUP would get down to the  business of government, we would not be dealing with this petty squabbling, to  which many of us have subjected in the Preparation for Government Committee.</p>
  		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
  		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  On a point of order, Madam Speaker. The issue that I wished to raise was not an  example of petty squabbling. I wanted to raise a matter of fact with the  Member. That was why I asked her to give way.</p>
  		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  That was not a point of order, Mr Storey.</p>
  		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  I have already dealt with the roads infrastructure and the roads maintenance  budget. However, my party believes that, generally speaking, there is also  short-term thinking in the comprehensive spending  review. We believe that the British Government are passing the buck to  the public, who must pay for the renewal of our infrastructure through  additional taxation in the form of water charges. That is not just short-sighted  but morally bankrupt.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">The direct rule Administration has been responsible for  neglecting our infrastructure for decades. They diverted investment towards  other purposes, such as security, although we would readily concede that both  sides&rsquo; paramilitaries carried out terrible acts during those years.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">It is right that there should be a complete end to all  forms of criminality and terrorism. The sectarianism that breeds discontent and  terrorism should also end. The correct course of action for the Government  would be for them to make good their neglect and make up for past deficits.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">If we had restored institutions, we could define spending  priorities for infrastructure. There are other issues to consider, including  the crucial North/South dimension. If we are to tackle the impediments that  partition has caused, we need to deal with the all-island spatial planning  strategy, which has come about as a result of the regional development strategy  in the North and the national spatial planning strategy in the South. Now that  that document has been published, work needs to start immediately.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">Other all-island regional development measures must be factored into a comprehensive spending  review, and we could do that if there was restoration. Such measures  include the creation of an all-island transportation and infrastructural body  and the all-island free-travel scheme, which, thankfully, will be implemented  next April. For the life of us, we do not understand why that is subject to a  consultation here and not in the South. We need a strengthened all-island  approach to road safety, given that this week we have seen terrible tragedies, some of which resulted in death.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">We also need an integrated approach to road signage,  marking, speed measurements and penalties. The benefits of an all-island  approach to spending on our infrastructure are already visible as a result of  the Dublin Government&rsquo;s investment in the City of Derry Airport and the joint management of the Newry/Dundalk road  construction project, which, coincidentally, Roads Service manages.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">Fundamental to the debate is a need for the DUP and Sinn  F&eacute;in to change their political attitudes and mindsets. We witnessed the  semblance of a love-in of the Preparation for Government Committee. That  attitude needs to be restored, and I hope we will see some of its benefit.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">The obstacles to political progress must be removed so that all our political institutions can be  restored. That will ensure that together we can define the spending priorities for a new Programme for Government  that will facilitate the renewal and rebuilding of a sustainable economy  and infrastructure on an all-island basis.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">That includes our social and recreational spheres of life.  From a comprehensive spending point of view, we should also look forward to the  2012 Olympics and to what we in the North of Ireland can do to contribute to a  greater investment in sport and recreation and to the Olympics &mdash; perhaps that  contribution can be made on all-island basis.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">Our communities demand the restoration of political  institutions, and they demand that we all grow up and politically equip  ourselves properly. They want a reinvigorated  approach to developing our infrastructure. That can be achieved through  making infrastructure a major priority in the Programme for Government and for  a new Executive.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP cannot wait for the day on which the DUP and Sinn  F&eacute;in wise up to their responsibilities and  join with the rest of us in forming that new Executive and in making  decisions for people here, so that we do not encounter the problems such as  those that the South Eastern Education and  Library Board encountered yesterday.  We should be able to put financial programmes in place for that board so  that it can cater for children who have special educational needs.  Concessionary travel passes were removed from children who attend schools in  the South Eastern Education and Library Board area, thus marginalising those  who live in rural communities. Those passes should be reinstated.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">We look forward to  defining those spending priorities for a new Executive.</p>
  		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  It appears that the price that we will pay for this debate will be the  formation of sub&shy;committees under the charge of the Preparation for Government  Committee. If it is to be believed, Sinn F&eacute;in will grace the Chamber to debate  the reports of the supposed subcommittees.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">However, not one of the subcommittees that the Secretary of  State has conceded to Sinn F&eacute;in will cover a Programme for Government. Instead,  the issue has been shunted here for us to take note of today. Surely the work  of a priority subcommittee &mdash; directed by a Committee  that is charged with preparing for government &mdash; would be expected to include a report on the essence of a  Programme for Government.</p>
  		<p class="TimePeriod">2.00 pm</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">Perhaps it is deliberate that the instinct of a natural  agitator, with form and history of rubbing people up the wrong way, is all too  obvious in the choice of motion that he has sent to us to debate today. Perhaps  it is his warped, cynical arrogance that, in an effort to find favour with Tony  or Gordon, leads Peter to report back and say, &ldquo;Look at clever me. I have  contrived to have the democrats in the Assembly reach consensus.&rdquo; In truth, the  consensus is not to prepare for or restore devolution, but one based on disdain  for the Secretary of State having the audacity and temerity to insult this  House with this motion.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">The motion draws attention to a Programme for Government. When was it agreed that a proper  Northern Ireland Assembly, if restored, would inherit and adopt all  aspects of governance and management that have been introduced and practised  under direct rule? If this Hain Assembly threw out its sponsor&rsquo;s own motion,  what effect would that have on Government thinking?</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">What purpose is there in noting the action of the  direct-rule decision process on spending, when the outcome would, more than  likely, be entirely different if those spending actions were brought to a  proper Assembly by its own Minister? Surely Peter Hain should consider asking  this House whether his regime is fit for purpose and fit to govern in the  manner that any other part of the United Kingdom would expect, because he is  failing to govern in that way in Northern Ireland. I suspect that he knows the  answer to that question, and I would be concerned if he did not.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">What mark out of 10 would we give him on education, health,  infrastructure, fishing, agriculture, closing down crime and protecting the  vulnerable from thuggery? We on this side of the House would be hard pressed to  give him four out of 10.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">Let us set aside spending and look first at the costs  involved in education. The Minister with responsibility for education cannot  account for the costs of running education in Northern Ireland, because, like  her predecessors, she does not know the costs. There is no bottom line, no  starting point on expenditure and no monetary or fiscal strategy. The  Government are working without a sustainable schools policy. How can someone  run a business, a charity, or even a social club, let alone a Government  Department, without having a sustainable policy in place? When our community  groups put together a funding plan, the first question that they are asked, and  the big question that they must answer, is whether their plan is sustainable,  yet this Government runs our Department of Education without a sustainable  schools policy.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">I cannot take note of the motion, Madam Speaker, because  that would give the impression that I am content with a spending review that  relies on savage spending cuts. The spending review introduces education  budgets for the purpose of whipping in punitive measures that act ultimately  against children.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">However, the Secretary of State refuses to grant us an  education debate or an RPA debate that includes education. His arrogance hides  his lack of bottle. He knows that in playing the consensus card he sends an  open invitation to certain people to use their veto &mdash; as they did today and will continue to do until the  situation changes. That is what has happened.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">Not only does Sinn F&eacute;in refuse to come into this Chamber to  debate with us, but the Secretary of State now enables it to dictate what will  be debated. As a result, he bottles out of approving a debate that was  requested by those who show respect to the House, who will attend and who will  take part in debates. Instead, we are landed with a Hain motion for the Hain  Assembly on the Hain regime spending review allied to the Hain Programme for  Government.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">It has been said &mdash; correctly &mdash; that we are all at fault.  Although I passionately believe that the objective of devolution is to make  elected Members masters of this House, it would be foolish to let that  aspiration transpire without first ensuring that there would be a transition  period for devolving Departments into the hands of an agreed Executive. What  would we take over? We would be ultimately accepting the blame for, and the  consequences of, direct rule. The legacy of direct rule will be an inherited  shambles, based not on what is best for Northern Ireland and its people but on  what the Exchequer sees fit for Northern Ireland and its people in costs only.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">It is therefore nonsense to think that I would take note of  spending reviews and spending priorities for a Programme for Government unless  I had a practical input into agreeing a Programme for Government to be  recommended to the people of Northern Ireland. Government cannot be approached  without the comprehensive agreement of the vision enshrined in a Programme for  Government.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">Coming out of terrorist activity and compounded by  lamentable direct-rule governance, we need to restore confidence not only  through offering a vision for the future but by being capable in this House of  delivering the costs of such an agreed vision. It would be irresponsible to do otherwise, and it would be  downright stupid to negotiate the restoration of a devolved Assembly on  the basis of becoming accountable by default and of inheriting and therefore  administering for the foreseeable future not our vision but the policies of the  outgoing Government.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">Madam Speaker, there was talk earlier about the Preparation  for Government Committee. Despite the reference in the Hansard report of a  &ldquo;love-in&rdquo;, the prospects of consensus in that Committee were not served by  remarks identifying some of its members as &ldquo;the Taliban&rdquo;. I take exception to  that, even though those remarks were not made in my direction. I sat through  some 20-odd &mdash; and some of them were very odd &mdash; hours of intensive discussion  and grilling and for one party it was a case of &ldquo;hear no evil, see no evil,  speak no evil&rdquo;.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">We are assembled here. Rather than take note of the  Secretary of State&rsquo;s motion, I ask through you, Madam Speaker, when is he going to take note of the democrats elected  to this House, willing &mdash; and showing their willingness &mdash; to be in their place  of work? When will he do so in a manner that denies the abstentionists any more  oxygen to their veto?</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">Will it be better come September? That remains to be seen,  and the onus between now and then is on the Preparation for Government  Committee. Does that mean that debates will now be regulated continuously by  the Secretary of State? Or does it mean that this Assembly will take control of  its business and begin to be master in its own house?</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">Perhaps, Madam Speaker,  over the recess, a decision could be reached and relayed to us  corporately. If not, look around you. Is the action of the absentees  deliberate, to bring disgrace to this House? If you were a member of the  public, what would you think of what you see here today?</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">It is incumbent upon the Secretary of State to deny the  veto process adopted by one party. Otherwise, he is creating a shambles around  his own neck.</p>
  		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  Some specific issues show that the spending  review falls down in its delivery to the people of the Province. It is a  challenge to outline where it will not meet its mark and where it will not  deliver.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">One issue, alive in the minds of those of us who represent  the east of the Province, is that of children with special needs, particularly  in the area covered by the South Eastern Education and Library Board. The  boards are under pressure to cut spending, and those cuts will impact  specifically on children with special needs. The spending review disadvantages  the children of Northern Ireland, especially since the Government are keen to  make what they term &ldquo;efficiency reviews&rdquo; and savings.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">The DUP is, with other  parties, committed to helping those  who most need it &mdash; the children. Unions, parents, teachers and elected  representatives vigorously oppose the imposition of a commissioner to the South  Eastern Education and Library Board. That matter has already been raised in this Chamber, but the point must  be made.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">Government are enforcing budgets and threatening education  and library boards with court action if those budgets are not adhered to, never  mind that the needs of the children increase each year. How can parents be  expected to cope when two new taxes are imposed, yet their much-needed services  are removed because the Government want to save money? It is unrealistic for  the spending review to talk of delivering services while, at the same time,  taking them away.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">The Government seems desperate to shave off money here,  there and everywhere, while imposing taxes on the populace at alarming rates.  Labour is the party of taxation; some 80-odd taxes have been introduced in its  nine years in Government. That says a great  deal. Perhaps two foreign wars and the consequent loss of life are  taking their toll on the Treasury. The fact that enough decent, modern equipment  cannot be supplied to the armed forces is an indication of how bad the  situation is, and the Government should be reprimanded for that.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">Perhaps this Government have delivered very little on  promises to the people of the United Kingdom. If anything, things have gone  backwards. If the record is examined, the previous Tory Government are blamed  for anything that has gone wrong. However, in nine long years the Labour  Government have not delivered; they have  passed the buck, ducked and dived. Now they have begun to impose taxes  in order to look as if they care about education and the Health Service.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Even under the Tories, nurses were not being sacked  because of budget cuts.</p>
  		<p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">In my constituency of Strangford, and across the entire  Province, tourism has the potential to boost the economy and lead to more jobs.  It could lead to diversification for the rural economy and the farming  community. In times of hardship, the rural community has been held back by  draconian planning rules and regulations. We have already debated &lsquo;Draft Policy  Planning Statement 14&rsquo; in the Chamber. If planning regulations were eased,  tourism could be boosted in the rural economy. That issue should be examined in  the spending review.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">In the past few days, the financial boost given to 12 July  parades has been a topic in the press. That boost to at least one section of  the community is welcome and could be replicated across the Province to benefit  many areas. That wonderful, colourful celebration of culture is of historical importance, and it has tremendous tourism potential. If the same financial  opportunity were afforded to others, thousands of jobs could be created.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">Many families in my constituency are already feeling the  strain from the lack of investment and spending. Many of my constituents look  after elderly relatives without any support from the NHS and social services  because the budgets cannot meet their needs, such as one hour a week of  respite. Long lists of people need the services of the NHS, but the services  are limited because of budget cutbacks and lack of investment. The spending  review does not address those issues. Waiting lists in my constituency, and in many other constituencies, show that it is the  volunteers &mdash; the carers &mdash; who look after the elderly and the ill. The  Eastern Health and Social Services Board and the Ulster Community and Hospitals  Trust do not have the budgets to deliver a satisfactory carer service to the  community. The demands will increase because there are more old people. Will  the spending review match that? I believe that it will not. For that reason, I  have grave concerns.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">In 2001, my colleague Kieran McCarthy and I raised the  issue of roads. What we said was very clear: the minor roads budget for the  Ards peninsula and the Strangford constituency is the same today as it was 10  years ago. How can a roads budget remain at the same level as it was 10 years  ago? Those roads are 10 years older and in need of repair. The population has  grown and road traffic has increased. There is no logic whatsoever to the roads  budget. The spending review does not address the issue of road provision.</p>
  		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  This is a point that we wanted to raise earlier with the hon Member from the  SDLP. There has been a &pound;50 million reduction in the Roads Service&rsquo;s maintenance  budget. Under the Review of Public Administration, roads provision will become  the responsibility of the new councils. Does the Member agree that one of the  first tasks for the new super-councils will be to raise the rates in order to  fix this basic asset, which will be neglected between now and 2009 because of  that financial deficit?</p>
  		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  After many lean years for the roads budget, the new super-councils &mdash; should  there be seven, 11 or 15 &mdash; will be facing hard times. It is only fair that  councillors who are responsible for roads are given a budget to address the  issue. The Member is absolutely right.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">The spending review should include a job-creation strategy,  whether it comes from Invest Northern Ireland or directly from Government, that  gives people the opportunity to find jobs.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">This week, again, there have been more job losses in my  constituency. One small village with a population of 800 or 900 people has lost  120 jobs over the past two years. Across the area, 3,000 jobs have gone. The  onus is on Invest Northern Ireland and the Government to deliver a strategy and  a plan of action that creates opportunities  for people in my constituency and also creates wealth and gives an  economic boost to the area. That is not happening, and I find that very worrying.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">With regard to the spending review, farming, fishing and  rural affairs have suffered under Governments over time. Farmers tell me that  when they apply for grants and premiums, although there is a timescale within  which they should receive the money, they often have to wait three months or  six months longer for payment. The faceless bureaucrats do not see the hardship  on the farms; they do not see that the grant is part of the farm&rsquo;s budget and  is needed to keep the farm going and to pay the bank on time. It should be  possible in this age, with modern technology, to make grant payments within the  timescale. The Department of Agriculture and Rural Development should have a  system that is capable of doing that.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">The backbone of my constituency is farming and fishing.  People working in those industries already face severe hardships under the  current spending budget and under this  review. I hope that the Government will ensure that the extra taxes that  they propose to raise will be poured into the budget of this country for  spending in this country, and for spending in our constituencies on issues that  really matter, such as children&rsquo;s education, the safeguarding of jobs and doing  the best for the people whom we represent. This spending review, set up by the  Government, does not deliver that. Therefore, we must register our concerns  about, and our opposition to, the review.</p>
  		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hillis</strong>:  Like others, I begin by registering my complete dissatisfaction at the way in  which we have been expected to debate this motion with less than 48 hours&rsquo;  notice. The Secretary of State continues to treat us with considerable  disrespect.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">Although the wording of the motion is somewhat cumbersome,  and the sentiments perhaps a little presumptuous, it is nonetheless an  important debate. Everything hinges around  money. Quite a few Members have made important points in the debate, and  I am glad that a few Members are left in the Chamber as we continue. In the  time that I have, I want to concentrate on the tourism industry and explain why  I believe that spending on this area must be high on the priority list in any  future Programme for Government.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">I sometimes feel that  tourism is regarded as something of a bit player in the greater scheme  of things in Northern Ireland. It must be emphasised that tourism is a growing  part of the Northern Ireland economy, with much potential for further growth.  Sadly, at present, income from tourism represents only about 2% of gross  domestic product (GDP), which is a big contrast with the Republic of Ireland,  or with Scotland or England, where tourism represents between 5% and 6% of GDP.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">With imagination and vision, we can build on previously  untapped assets. I agree with Mr Shannon, particularly with regard to events  around 12 July. For example, we are now in the midst of what some people would  call the &ldquo;marching season&rdquo;, and for years tourists have been told that it is a  bad idea to visit Northern Ireland during the Twelfth, presumably because the  nasty orangemen would be on the march. The overt message was that something  nasty might happen to the hapless tourist. To my mind, that is absolute piffle.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">I am disappointed at the negative remarks made earlier by  the leader of the Alliance Party. For years others  and I have advocated that the Twelfth celebrations be marketed as a  major tourist attraction. Why not? It makes complete sense.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">It would never threaten the carnival of Rio, but it is unique; there is plenty of colour, music,  pageant, culture. Given a chance, it could be a major tourist  attraction.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">My party and I welcome the fact that money has now been set  aside to market the Twelfth as a major festival. My hon friend the Lord Laird  of Artigarvan and I find it extremely difficult to understand why tourism that  supports Ulster Scots is not more readily available. There are about 22 million  Scots Irish living in America, many of whom are anxious to come back to their  homeland for a visit. Ulster is the only part of the world where one can get  Ulster Scots culture. Why is there not much more targeted funding to allow us  to tap into this market? An opportunity awaits us from which everyone &mdash; and I mean everyone &mdash; can benefit.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">Since 1994, the total visitor numbers have grown by 60%,  with revenue increasing by 80%. Now tourism is expected to contribute well over  &pound;400 million to the Northern Ireland economy. Members will agree that those are  positive figures. It would appear, however, that the financial mandarins are  intent on jeopardising the excellent work of our tourism industry. I base this statement  on the fact that the draft &lsquo;Priorities and Budget 2006-08&rsquo; did not include any  resources for some areas of tourism additional to the bid made by the Northern  Ireland Tourist Board of &pound;1&middot;5 million &mdash; not an enormous amount &mdash; for regional  tourism partnerships (RTPs).</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">These partnerships have critical responsibility for  regional promotion and development of the regional tourism product. They market  the regions, sell city breaks, and attract cruise ships, conferences and activity breaks. The co-ordination of effort and  resources across local councils and individual industry members means  that the RTPs&rsquo; key successes have helped remedy duplication and inefficiency in  the delivery of tourism. Since their creation they have proved a positive  example of public/private sector partnership, and now over 2,000  private/commercial sector business members are in partnerships with RTPs.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">Much public sector investment in RTPs has to date been from  EU funds which came to an end in March of this year. The current Budget made no  provision for these partnerships beyond that date, leaving a void when the EU  funding ceased. This was filled by the industry, local government and from the  NITB funding, leaving less in its already depleted budget.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">The Northern Ireland Tourist Industry Confederation  explained the gravity of this situation recently in its response to the draft  &lsquo;Priorities and Budget 2006-08&rsquo;:</p>
  		<p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Failure to direct public sector funding to RTPs will  be extremely negative to the tourist industry.&rdquo;</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">The Department of Enterprise,  Trade and Investment tourism spend has, I admit, risen from &pound;184 million  in 2004-05 to &pound;219&middot;5 million in 2007-08. This increase is very welcome indeed.</p>
  		<p class="TimePeriod">2.30 pm</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">Those figures do not include the funding that has been  ring-fenced for the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway visitor centre. While I am on that  subject, I appeal to all concerned organisations to quicken the pace on the  visitor centre. I am glad that a design has been chosen, but we have been without a visitor centre for some  time.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">The global environment for tourism is highly competitive. I  have had the pleasure of visiting the World Travel Market in London on more  than one occasion. It is quite frightening to see what is on offer in the  holiday market. Eastern European destinations are now posing great competitive  pressure, and the EU in general is losing out to the Far East and the Middle  East, a trend that is likely to continue. If Northern Ireland is to compete in  this environment, it is essential to have an investment structure to meet the  needs set out in the Northern Ireland Tourist Board&rsquo;s Strategic Framework for  Action 2004-07.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">Unfortunately, many of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s depart&shy;mental  budgets and priorities mention tourism as an add-on,  rather than as an important sector of the economy. I sometimes think that  tourism is the Cinderella of our economy. There must be adequate provision for,  and sustainable investment in, our tourism industry in any future Programme for  Government. If that does not happen, I will have serious concerns for Northern  Ireland plc.</p>
  		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>: I  will begin on a positive note and assume that everyone here wants to get back  to work as quickly as possible in an all-inclusive power-sharing Assembly. In such circumstances, we need a  Programme for Government that has the soundest financial control &mdash;  public scrutiny. That has been sadly lacking for the past three-and-a-half  years of suspension.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">Assuming that common sense prevails and a new Assembly can  be formed, an audit strategy should be put  in place to address issues relating to the management of money and risk  assessments. Proper guidelines should also be put in place to show civil  servants where their remit begins and ends.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">The Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee in West&shy;minster,  Mr Edward Leigh, influenced by talks that he has had with United States  congressmen, has been calling for improvements in financial scrutiny. Mr Leigh  has drawn to the attention of Parliament the willingness of the National Audit  Office to support the Committee. From my  experience as a member of several Committees in the previous Assembly,  we would have welcomed such support and co-operation from the Northern Ireland Audit Office. That would have  given us the opportunity to address previous errors and failings.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">We have not been allowed to take any interest in the  financial affairs of the Assembly, but there is a budget of more than &pound;1  billion of taxpayers&rsquo; money. It is surely incredible and unique in the world of  finance that a corporation, if I may call the Assembly that, is responsible for  so much money, yet exercises no financial control over it.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">However, it is much  worse than that: the 108 Members continue to be paid, while those who  refuse to reach agreement to run the  Assembly complain about plans to increase rates, introduce water charges  and threaten the very future existence of the manufacturing industry. Only  yesterday, children with special needs were told that their rights to equality  were finished, and today there is a commissioner crawling all over the books of  the South Eastern Education and Library Board to do just that.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">Several investigations are under way relating to the manner in which public money has been spent.  Every&shy;thing must be done to ensure  that any future Programme for  Government is not impeded by costly investigations that could be prevented  if proper strategies are in place to ensure that Members have the appropriate  written and oral briefings from the audit office.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">How much longer must we rely on journalists to uncover what  is wrong with the financial affairs of this Assembly? When will we derail the  gravy train that rumbles on bringing direct rule Ministers, senior civil  servants, and other heads of non-departmental public bodies to the four corners  of the earth for reasons that are ill defined and poorly justified?</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">Again, on a positive note, there is an opportunity to  enhance the work of the Public Accounts Committee. This is particularly  important because we must review the practice where public expenditure is  reviewed after the event, rather than before the horse has bolted. In order to  achieve that, I would like to see an approach made to the Comptroller and  Auditor General at the Northern Ireland Audit Office to ensure that the Public  Accounts Committee can play its full part in strengthening financial scrutiny  within its current terms of reference. This is vital if we are to address  issues relating to risks to future delivery that can be assessed and managed.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">A new Assembly must avoid the embarrassments where millions  of pounds are wasted on projects such as DeLorean, the sheep annual premium  scheme and various other training schemes that did not achieve their purpose.  We must bring to an end the scandals of millions of pounds spent on  transatlantic trips of questionable value to the ratepayer.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">It is equally important that any future Programme for  Government, and the money attached to it, makes clear where it is appropriate, if at all, to accept hospitality  such as dinners, galas, days at the races, and so on. <span style="letter-spacing:-.25pt; ">Indeed, the whole area of public procurement or contracts,</span> worth  many millions of taxpayers&rsquo; money, has been undermined  by scandals relating to hospitality and gifts.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">I do not propose to go into any detail because there are  ongoing police inquiries, and I would not wish to prejudice those in any way.  However, if the Assembly were up and running there would at least be an  opportunity to ask searching questions about who is on the gravy train, how  much they have benefited from it, and when it will stop.</p>
  		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  Does the hon Member for East Londonderry also agree about, and include in that  list, the abolition of the Civic Forum, which cost the previous Assembly and  the taxpayers of Northern Ireland over &pound;2  million and delivered absolutely nothing?</p>
  		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>: I  am happy to say that the Civil Forum was a splendid organisation.<em> [Laughter.]</em></p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">The Civic Form took up the issue of literacy and numeracy &mdash;  a matter very close to my heart &mdash; and it produced a splendid report. Given that  we have 25% of the population, or 250,000 people in the North, leaving school  with the lowest skills in reading and writing, I do not understand why it is a  laughing matter.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">All those issues must be worked on so that any new Assembly  has the mechanisms ready to roll when it takes over responsibility for the  Programme for Government &mdash; that is if it is serious about it and does not find  it a joke.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, one of the first tasks is to draw up the  criteria for an effective internal audit mechanism, and the involvement of the  Northern Ireland Audit Office is crucial. So, too, is the strengthening of the  work of the Assembly&rsquo;s Public Accounts Committee, and this would entail a  change in its terms of reference.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">The Committee on the Preparation for Government should devote time to examining the current  procedures, look at best practice in other jurisdictions and have in  place mechanisms that will radically change current procedures, which are more  about shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted, rather than ensuring  that there are controls in place internally that would prevent scandals,  embarrassments and bad practice in the first place.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">However, much depends on how sincere we are about taking  responsibility for the Programme for Government.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">Nothing that I have heard recently indicates that there is  any real hope that political morality is about to dawn on this Assembly. In the  meantime, credibility is fast going out the window, public patience is at  breaking point, and much of what I have said is falling on deaf ears. People  refuse to listen, and minds cannot comprehend that we have moved on.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">This may be our last opportunity to convince the world that  we really care, but I doubt if anyone will be convinced that there is any real  desire to take responsibility for what we are paid to do. Perhaps I am wrong; I  hope that I am wrong. Many people feel sick at the behaviour of elected  representatives who are blocking the democratic rights of people to take charge  of their own affairs. Today, we have had a lot of hot air from the DUP and cold  water from Sinn F&eacute;in.</p>
  		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  The next Member to speak is George Ennis. This is his maiden speech, so please  show him the usual courtesy.</p>
  		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ennis</strong>:  Thank you, Madam Speaker, for those kind words.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the opportunity that this Assembly has been given  to discuss the comprehensive spending review. The review covers much too wide a  range of subjects for me to attempt to cover in this short speech.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">Members have raised many important issues already. In order  to benefit the economy in the best way, the comprehensive spending review must  be directed at the areas of greatest importance and those that will deliver the  greatest return. The case against the removal of industrial derating has been  put in the Chamber already, and I fully support that case. Like industrial  derating, the issue of corporation tax has been raised many times in the  Assembly, and in other forums, in recent months. However, we must continue to  discuss the issue. The comprehensive spending review should focus on issues  that must be addressed in order to make Northern Irish businesses more  competitive. If we are to deliver this world-class Northern Ireland that is  often spoken about, we must recognise that corporation tax is a barrier to  achieving that most laudable of aims.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">Northern Ireland faces many different challenges to those  faced in the rest of the United Kingdom, because of the land border. A review  of corporation tax levels is needed so that we are not placed at a competitive  disadvantage to our neighbours. However, that is not the be-all and end-all; that measure will not miraculously  jump-start the Northern Ireland economy. It must be part of a broader plan and  a strategic approach adopted in areas such as the comprehensive spending  review. That review can target investment  at the most important areas and stimulate high-quality investment in the  local economy, which will then pay the highest dividends.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">Government cannot continue to use the argument of cost to  justify any reluctance in this area. We are not asking for a blank cheque or an  unquantifiable return from investment. This would be a strategic investment in  the future of Northern Ireland, leading to Northern Ireland positioning itself  among the best places in the world in which to invest, and bringing in spin-off  benefits that such a position would create.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">Some small steps have already been taken in the past. For instance, the last Budget increased the  research and development tax allowance to firms above the current small  and medium-sized enterprises&rsquo; research and  development tax credit threshold. Such mechanisms will deliver  investment to Northern Ireland, but it will be  a guaranteed investment, with a high-quality reward. Such investment  must be targeted through mechanisms such as the comprehensive spending review.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">We must encourage other ventures &mdash; for example, knowledge-transfer  partnerships. For some time, our universities have been involved with such  partnerships, which can deliver information and expertise to the business and  private sectors. Those partnerships are of particular use to businesses that  previously have not invested in research and development, and Northern Ireland companies are low in research and  development financing.</p>
  		<p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">They are also a way for smaller businesses to make use of  high-quality knowledge, with direct benefit to their business. The Department  of Trade and Industry currently provides 60% of the funding for  knowledge-transfer partnerships for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). As much encouragement as  possible should be given to SMEs to  participate in those schemes and the benefits should be made clear to  them. An increase in support to businesses, particularly smaller businesses and  those not previously involved in that scheme, could help to encourage further  participation.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">Similarly, those on the other side of the partnership must be fully supported to enable them to help as  many businesses as possible. Support  must be given to ensure adequate resources on the academic side of the partner&shy;ships  to deliver the knowledge and expertise to those businesses that can be  encouraged to take up the offer.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">Although the main focus of knowledge-transfer partnerships  is often through universities, some further education colleges are already  involved in such programmes. Different businesses have different needs, and not  all will require the high-level expertise of the university sector. Improving  the networks between local business and further education colleges can help to  bring businesses into the system at a relevant level and on a scale that is  manageable for small businesses.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">All those proposals could help to increase research and  knowledge in Northern Ireland&rsquo;s business sector. Everyone knows that the public  sector plays much too great a role in the economy; that will not be turned  around overnight. It will require a strategic focus from the Assembly and at  least a medium-term investment in those areas that will deliver the best  returns for Northern Ireland plc. Outside the political process, the economy is  the most important aspect on which Government must focus if any semblance of  stability is to be achieved.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">I hope that notice is taken of the motion and of this  afternoon&rsquo;s debate in the Chamber. We remain to be convinced that previous  debates have been taken on board, but we, as elected Members, must continue to  put forward our case. I hope too that that the correct strategic approach to  developing the economy can be put in place.</p>
  		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Robert  Coulter</strong>: I have learned from my engineering experience that, when it comes  to this time in the afternoon, the longer  the spoke the greater the tyre.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">I support Members who said that this is no way to operate  an Assembly. It shows a flagrant disregard for the seriousness of the public  business that we are trying to conduct. At the heart of the problem lies a  total lack of meaningful consultation, and behind that lies a lack of respect,  verging on contempt, for the Assembly. I appeal to all Members to recognise  that we have it in our power to end the Secretary of State&rsquo;s control over all  those matters that are so vital to the interests of our constituents.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">Lack of consultation is also at the heart of what I have to  say about the spending reviews of 2004 and 2007. The point is that direct rule  Ministers produced those reviews without  consulting the Assembly. Indeed, MLAs were summoned to the Long Gallery  to be told the details of important aspects  of the spending reviews &mdash; and that was after the event had been publicly  announced and the details given to the press. That shows scant regard for the  democratic process.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">There are important items that are not catered for in the  spending review, with particular reference to my own party brief, which is  health. To begin with, the failure of the Review of Public Administration to  separate primary and community care budgets from hospital budgets will mean  that hospital budgets will continue to drain resources and starve primary and  community care of the funds needed. That, of course, runs counter to Government  policy, which is to boost preventative medicine. The best way to do that would  be by funding primary and community care separately from the hospitals.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">Leaving primary and community care at the end of the queue  after hospitals makes it an &ldquo;Aunt Sally&rdquo; service, and fatally undermines the  whole process of the Review of Public Administration with regard to health  services. We should demand that that situation be reviewed at the earliest  opportunity, before it is set in stone and we create another service that will  go wrong at the planning stage. I call on the Secretary of State to ring-fence  primary and community care budgets as a matter of urgency.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, with the central trauma centre being located in  Belfast, extra demands will inevitably be placed on the Northern Ireland  Ambulance Service, for which additional provision must be made. I call for the  establishment and proper funding of an air ambulance service to ferry seriously  ill patients to the new central trauma centre. Northern Ireland is the only  part of the United Kingdom that does not have a dedicated air ambulance  service. That is an absolute necessity if we are not to abandon whole swathes  of rural Northern Ireland to inadequate emergency cover. I speak here of  Tyrone, the county of my birth. The western and northern parts of Northern  Ireland will not have adequate cover in an emergency. We have not been consulted,  and this matter has not been properly budgeted for.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">I draw the Assembly&rsquo;s attention to two salient points in  relation to health budgets. First, the Bamford Review of Mental Health and  Learning Disability (Northern Ireland) spoke of serious deficiencies in  investment in mental health in Northern Ireland compared to Great Britain. That  underinvestment affects the real lives of real people, especially in view of  the suicide rates here among young men.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, it is important to note that the Appleby Report  of 2004 stated that an additional 7% is needed in general health budgets to  meet all needs. The common theme that emerges from these matters is that there  is no substitute for the democratic control of public business by this  democratically elected Assembly. I appeal, therefore, to the Secretary of State  to give the Assembly control of its own agenda. It is only by doing that that  some order can be brought into the conduct of public affairs in Northern  Ireland.</p>
  		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B Bell</strong>:  Does the hon Member agree that in any future Programme for Government or any  future spending programme, provision should be made by the Northern Ireland  Assembly for free care for elderly people, similar to that which pertains in  Scotland?</p>
  		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr Robert  Coulter</strong>: When one comes to my age one can identify with those sentiments.  My party and I would fully support the idea of free personal care for the  elderly.</p>
  		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I had a dream last night. The dream was that we were in this Assembly on 25  November. The Benches were full, but I saw four figures hugging one another,  glad-handing and clapping one another on the back. Who were they?</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">Who were they?</p>
  		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  I must point out, Mr Maginness, that that day is a Saturday. What about Monday  27 November? <em>[Laughter.]</em></p>
  		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  You have ruined the punchline. It was a dream, so I should be permitted a bit  of poetic licence, Madam Speaker.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">The four figures were Willie McCrea, Alex Maskey, Mervyn  Storey and Gerry Kelly. Where is Mervyn? I see that he is not here. They were  hugging one another and patting one another on the back and asking, &ldquo;What  Ministry do you have?&rdquo; They walked out of the Chamber down the corridor to room  21 to meet with Ian Paisley, the First Minister, and Gerry Adams, the Deputy  First Minister.</p>
  		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr William  McCrea</strong>: On a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker. Can Members really lead  us down the path of fantasy? Surely we should be debating reality.</p>
  		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  That was not a point of order, but I would like him to continue.</p>
  		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  Of course, there are historical precedents for such events. Brian Faulkner,  John Hume, Gerry Fitt and Paddy Devlin all shared the same Cabinet table in the power-sharing Administrations in which  they worked together for the good of the people of Northern Ireland.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">That was my dream. Of course it is not true, but come 25  November it could be the reality, and I hope that it will be. However, it will  not come true if the DUP continues with its obstructionism and Sinn F&eacute;in  continues with its abstentionism. We have the two great negatives: the  negativity of Sinn F&eacute;in and that of the DUP.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">You can whinge all that you want today, and you have had a  really good cracking session of whinging &mdash; absolutely. The Secretary of State  has been so badly kicked that he is barely conscious. He has been kicked,  stoned and generally derided and ridiculed. Why? It is because he exercises  power. You could exercise that power if tomorrow you signed on the dotted line  and said to Gerry Adams and the rest of them that you will form a power-sharing  Executive for the good of the people of Northern Ireland.</p>
  		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Nesbitt</strong>:  When the Member talked about our whinging, he spurred me on to ask a question.  Although I have just come in, I wish to note &mdash;</p>
  		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I was not talking about you.</p>
  		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Nesbitt</strong>:  I did not say that you were. However, I noted that you praised the Government  of the Brian Faulkner era many years ago. Do you agree that the Government that  was formed then, although it was short term, was formed on the basis of a  voluntary coalition between the SDLP and unionism?</p>
  		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  Let me put it this way: the notion of power  sharing is fundamental to remedying a divided society. All the parties,  including Brain Faulkner&rsquo;s, accepted that power sharing was fundamental to the  future. I do not care whether you call that a voluntary coalition or an  involuntary coalition: it was a power-sharing coalition. That is the  fundamental objective for all of us if we want to reform this society and  create a sustained peace. We must create a power-sharing Executive if we want  to create harmony instead of disharmony and tolerance instead of intolerance.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">That is the only way forward, folks. We can say goodbye to  any form of power unless it is shared. That is the message that the Secretary  of State and all reasonable people in the  community are sending to you.</p>
  		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Donaldson</strong>:  With all due respect to the Member, that is not the message that the Secretary  of State is sending us. If the message were simply that we should form a  power-sharing Executive, we could do that with the Member&rsquo;s party tomorrow.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">The message is very different: we can have a power-sharing  Executive only if it comprises a range of parties, including Sinn F&eacute;in. The  Member knows the difficulty that we have with that. We are not against the  principle of power sharing; we simply need to know that the criminality,  violence and intimidation, which happen in his constituency and in mine, are at  an end.</p>
  		<p class="TimePeriod">3.00 pm</p>
  		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  All the significant elements that make up the political landscape of this  Assembly and this society must be included in government &mdash; it is as simple as  that.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">You cannot exclude a significant section of the political  community in Northern Ireland. You cannot do that and hope for stability and to  progress to a new and dynamic society in which there is real peace and harmony.  If you think otherwise, you are quite wrong. You must be mad if you think that  the SDLP will suddenly say, &ldquo;Aha, that is the solution to the problem. We will  form a voluntary coalition&rdquo; &mdash; as you call it &mdash; &ldquo;with the unionist parties, and  that will solve the problem&rdquo;.</p>
  		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Donaldson</strong>:  I remind the Member that, in the previous Assembly, his party sought to exclude  the DUP from the Executive; therefore, it is not true to say that the SDLP has  been consistent on this issue. Were the SDLP consistent, it would accept the  principle that there can be no Executive without the DUP.</p>
  		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  The Member is wrong. The SDLP fought long and hard to achieve power sharing.  From the early 1970s and right through the 1980s and 1990s, that was our  political objective. We fought long and hard to achieve that and to put  everybody together, including the DUP. We never told the Ulster Unionists to  exclude the DUP. You should know that, because you were in the Ulster Unionists  at the time. Perhaps your memory is fading. However, every significant element  of political opinion in Northern Ireland must be included in the power-sharing  arrangements.</p>
  		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McFarland</strong>:  Do I take from the Member&rsquo;s exhortation that all parties should form a  Government now and that his party is comfortable with going into government  tomorrow with Sinn F&eacute;in, which is clearly not dedicated to law and order and  which does not support policing? I understood the SDLP&rsquo;s position to be that it  would not go into government with Sinn F&eacute;in until that party supported law and  order. Is that still the case?</p>
  		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>: It is quite simple, Madam Speaker. If the opportunity arises,  we in the SDLP would form an Administration with the DUP, the Ulster Unionists and Sinn F&eacute;in tomorrow. We have not set  preconditions for Sinn F&eacute;in or any other political party. Of course Sinn  F&eacute;in should sign up to the new policing arrange&shy;ments; it has been disgraceful  and irresponsible in not supporting them.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">Indeed, in many areas of Belfast and elsewhere throughout  Northern Ireland we see the result of the fact that there is a policing vacuum,  which has been caused in part by Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s irresponsibility. People are  suffering as a result of that vacuum. Yes, Sinn F&eacute;in should sign up to  policing, and we want it to do that, but we do not make it a precondition to  establishing an Executive.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">I have no criticism of your raising all the issues that you  have talked about today. It is right and proper that you do so, because you are  concerned about your constituents and about the future of the Northern Ireland  economy. However, if we want to deal with those issues, the only way in which  to tackle them is to get to the very heart of the political problem here. How  is power to be transferred to you, as public represent&shy;atives, while including  everyone of significance in this Building and in this Assembly? That is the  central issue with which you as politicians must deal. I return to my dream &mdash;  of course it was a dream. Rev William McCrea said that it was a fantasy, but I  do not think that it was.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">It could well come true, though perhaps not on 25 November.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">Unless you face up to the reality of power sharing, we will  not move forward as a community. We will not move forward as politicians and  exercise real power. Also, in part, you, by the paralysis that you have brought  to the political system, are causing &mdash;</p>
  		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  Please draw your remarks to a close.</p>
  		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  In part, you are causing the very things that you are criticising today: the  rates increases; the problems with derating; and the difficulties in relation  to expenditure and education etc. You are partly responsible for that because  of your inability to face up to the political realities.</p>
  		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  Members should really speak through me and not refer to each other as &ldquo;you&rdquo;.</p>
  		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: In  January the Secretary of State launched his comprehensive spending review of  Northern Ireland Departments. That review has been repeated in other regions of  the United Kingdom and in other Departments that are not controlled in the  Northern Ireland block grant. Therefore it is a very encompassing review, and  we must bear that in mind.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">On several occasions the Secretary of State has highlighted  the over-dependence on public sector funding in Northern Ireland. It is right  that we re-examine our spending and our priorities in Northern Ireland.  However, Government must also examine the wider policies in the United Kingdom  that can adversely affect this region in particular.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">Ulster Unionists support that reassessment of how  Government does its business. We must attempt to reduce bureaucracy in the  Civil Service in Northern Ireland so that more money can be spent on front-line  services such as health and education, and to enable the Northern Ireland  economy to grow and to be sustainable.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">As my colleague Esmond Birnie said, that will become  increasingly important in future. In the past few years we have experienced  relatively large increases in public expenditure, and in future that  expenditure is likely to be rather lean.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">Public service must be about making a difference to the  quality of life in Northern Ireland. It should not be about frustrating the  public and the many skilled and hard-working civil servants by requiring high  levels of administration and mountains of paperwork to be completed. That was  well illustrated recently in the Long Gallery when the Ulster Farmers&rsquo; Union  (UFU) provided a pile of documents that was about a foot high that each farmer  must read in order to complete their paperwork. There must be a review of how  the Civil Service process is completed in Northern Ireland. It must be  sensible, and it must be lean.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">The Secretary of State has also criticised the  over-reliance on public sector funding in Northern Ireland. However, that must  be set in context. Northern Ireland has suffered from 30 years of violence.  That resulted in a loss of investment and higher policing and security costs.  The relatively high levels of organised crime in Northern Ireland inhibit  business, and they affect us all. We must support the necessary funding for the  police, the Assets Recovery Agency (ARA) and Customs and Excise. Government  should also reassess its policies, which on some occasions have created  opportunities for criminals.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">Although we welcome the increased numbers of customs  officers in Northern Ireland, would it not be much better to harmonise fuel  duties? Sir Reg Empey suggested that idea in January, and the Northern Ireland  Affairs Committee recently supported it. That would end fuel smuggling at  source by eliminating the profit. A much simpler result would be achieved.</p>
  		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Sir Reg Empey</strong>:  Does the Member agree that the funding that could be saved from the roughly 164  customs officers, plus all the policing time, could free up some of the  Northern Ireland Office (NIO) budget to honour the commitments that it made to  provide resources for the new policing college in Cookstown?</p>
  		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
  		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  All the parties in the Chamber would certainly support that. It is dreadful  that such an important decision has been delayed. The future training of  officers is being inhibited by the lack of funding. The Treasury must address  that urgently.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">During the troubles, relatively few private sector  investments were made. Many of our brightest young people chose to take their  skills elsewhere. We do not necessarily need less public-sector spending, but  we do need more private-sector investment and employment. The Government must  review their policies, which should encourage and support the private sector.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">With regard to taxation, Northern Ireland&rsquo;s land border  with another EU country means that it can be more adversely affected by  neighbouring fiscal regimes than can other UK regions. I ask that the Secretary  of State and the Treasury take that into consideration when determining tax  levels in Northern Ireland. Careful adjustment could even, in some instances, increase the Treasury&rsquo;s income from  Northern Ireland taxes. For example, the high level of excise duty on  fuels means that those who live in border areas choose, legally, to fill their  vehicles south of the border. Moreover, the opportunity to deal with fuel laundering  is being missed.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">There is a need to reduce corporation tax levels and to  increase R&amp;D opportunities in Northern Ireland. As other Members have said,  that is an area of concern. Research and development is largely being led by  the universities, and there is an urgent need to increase the level of funding  in the private sector. Without that, the future of our industry is  questionable. We must be at the cutting edge; our products must compete in the  global market.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">The Northern Ireland section of the Irish Congress of Trade  Unions (ICTU) recently advocated diverting higher levels of corporation tax in  order to fund additional research and development. I believe, as do many of my  Colleagues, that this idea has much merit; it might overcome the Treasury&rsquo;s apparent  reluctance to reduce Northern Ireland&rsquo;s corporation tax levels to those in the  Republic of Ireland. Anything to improve Northern Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness and  encourage investment in R&amp;D and investment by industry must be welcomed. I  ask the Secretary of State to pursue that vigorously with the Treasury.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">With regard to industrial rates, the success of the  manufacturing sector is vital to the Northern Ireland economy as a whole. Many  service-sector jobs are dependent on money that was initially generated by the  manufacturing industry. What would happen if the industrial jobs were lost? It  is clear that all those jobs are interrelated.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">There is the potential for some companies to relocate to  the Republic of Ireland, which is seen as more business-friendly. Why should  Invest Northern Ireland be allowed to spend millions of pounds in encouraging  inward investment, when the full rates proposed for industrial premises have  the potential to export or end many existing industrial jobs?</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">The Northern Ireland Manufacturers Focus Group&rsquo;s campaign  to cap manufacturing rates had the unanimous support of all of the Assembly  Members present at the recent debate on the subject. I urge the Secretary of  State, even at this stage, to heed that.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">I support my colleague Norman Hillis, and many other  Members, in the view that we must build tourism opportunities in Northern  Ireland. Our gross domestic product for tourism is approximately 2%; we are  missing out on the levels of tourism experienced in the rest of the United Kingdom  and in the Republic of Ireland, where it is closer to 6%.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">The Twelfth of July should be a community festival. It used  to be, and there is no reason for it not to be again. There was, of course,  disruption, organised for political purposes, and the sooner that Sinn F&eacute;in  turns off those that it unleashed, the better for everyone in the community and  for our entire society.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">On electricity, my  colleague Esmond Birnie indicated his concern at the lack of an  announcement about the cost-reduction package. Northern Ireland suffered as a  result of the highly profitable electricity privatisation contracts, which were  sold at inflated values to the benefit of the Chancellor. Business users still  await the support promised by the former direct rule economy Minister, Ian  Pearson. When will that cost reduction come?</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">Another report that gave me concern was that produced by  the Commissioner for Victims and Survivors.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">The report states that, for the past eight years, some &pound;44  million had been used to support victims and survivors  of the troubles. The physical and psychological damage inflicted by the  troubles must be addressed, given that 3,500 murders and almost 50,000 injuries  have been recorded. The individuals and families concerned must be helped.  However, there is no long-term strategic plan for victims and survivors, and  the current proposals could result in the existing limited support being  reduced dramatically. That situation must be rectified.</p>
  		<p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">Although I welcome the opportunity to debate the priorities  contained in the spending review, I am concerned about the absence of Northern  Ireland Scrutiny Committees in which we would have had a chance to get to grips with the detail behind the  Budget. In the absence of those Committees, it is difficult to be fully  knowledgeable about the subject. However, I hope that the Secretary of State  listens. Regrettably, I fear that he may simply note the Official Report.</p>
  		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  The SDLP Member for North Belfast told us that devolution of power to this  Assembly lies at the heart of the problem. He is not correct, of course. The  criminal and paramilitary actions of Sinn F&eacute;in/IRA, its inactions in not supporting policing and justice, and  the fact that it will not identify the graves of the disappeared are the issues  that lie at the heart of the problem. I would have thought that the Member  would have recognised that those issues lie at the heart of the problem and  that they continue to concern people.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">Like my colleagues, I want to register my disgust at the  way in which the Secretary of State has treated the House &mdash; yet again. He treats the House, and Members, with  contempt. By implication, he also treats those who have elected us with  contempt. A motion has been foisted on us that is so broad that there has been  little continuity in the debate. I regret that.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">Money seems to fascinate the Secretary of State, be it the  comprehensive spending review or the ability of members of my party to sustain  themselves after 24 November if agreement is not reached. I want to put on  record &mdash; should the Secretary of State take the time to read the Official  Report &mdash; that he can carry out as many secret assessments as he likes, but he  must realise that monetary considerations will have no impact on the decisions  to be taken this autumn. The way in which that issue was spun to the media  shows that the Secretary of State knows nothing about what motivates me, my  party colleagues and, even more alarmingly, the majority of Northern Irish  people who vote for these parties. That is a pretty damning indictment of a man  who has been Secretary of State for Northern Ireland for quite some time.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">Ethnic minorities face  difficulties in my constituency and  throughout Northern Ireland. Before I am prevented from speaking, there  is a spending review implication in relation to that issue. Last month in  Dungannon, at a meeting of local residents who felt frustrated at the lack of  social housing in the town, views were expressed that caused me concern. Houses  that are on the market for sale and for rent are being snapped up by investors  and developers, resulting in first-time buyers being priced out of the market.  Those houses are let to people from ethnic backgrounds who have come to  Northern Ireland to work in local factories and to provide employers with  quality employees. For monetary gain, those developers pack the houses with 10  to 12 people, which not only exploits the scarce housing situation in Dungannon  but exploits those from ethnic backgrounds. Those landlords charge rent per  head, and if 10 people are living in a house at &pound;80 per head, per week, it is  difficult for young couples to compete in that market.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">This, of course, has the knock-on effect of alienating  young indigenous people in the local community and causing community tension,  something that, unfortun&shy;ately, as we have  seen from recent reports, is on the rise.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">How should the Government, and indeed all of us, deal with  this? First, I want to congratulate local police for the stand that they have  taken and the drive they have shown in dealing with ethnic tensions. However,  Government finance has a part to play. Last year the Government launched a  racial equality strategy but, unfortunately, little has been done, and  negligible resources have been set aside to deal with what was to be a  cross-departmental action plan.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">Recently, at a meeting with the Northern Ireland Council  for Ethnic Minorities the chief executive of that organisation expressed his  dismay at Government will to deal with what has become a large social issue in  this country. I and my colleague Lord Morrow contacted the Minister for Social  Development to seek a meeting in relation to the ongoing difficulties in  Dungannon, in particular the housing issue, which is one of the key causes of  problems in the area. We will push on that issue on behalf of those from the  ethnic minority community and on behalf of those from the indigenous community  who feel frustrated and alienated in their own local area.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">Another issue that I wish to address with regard to  Government spending &mdash; and colleagues would be surprised if I did not mention  the west &mdash; is the need to see Northern Ireland as a whole and not as two  halves. Other Members have addressed the disastrous conse&shy;quences of the RPA for  the west of Northern Ireland. This week, however, I was presently surprised  when I attended the launch of the fuel poverty strategy. In the Fuel Advisory Group&rsquo;s report, the first  recommendation was that strategies  to tackle fuel poverty should be rural proofed. I welcome that  realisation and call upon the Government to acknowledge that in their action  plan.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">Infrastructure deficits are most acute in the south-west of Northern Ireland, and I call upon the  Government, when considering the new investment strategy for Northern  Ireland, to ensure that due consideration is given to areas such as Fermanagh  and South Tyrone that urgently need a huge investment in roads infra&shy;structure.  The divisional roads office in the west has submitted new roads schemes for Fermanagh  and South Tyrone, and I ask the Government to take due notice of those bids.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">The west of Northern Ireland is falling behind, not because  of the will of those of us who live there, but because of the Government&rsquo;s will  to look at Northern Ireland as a whole and not as two distinct halves. If the  Northern Ireland Office is serious about sustainability and long-term growth,  nothing less is required.</p>
  		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Donaldson</strong>:  While none of us likes the manner in which the Secretary of State called this  debate, nevertheless any opportunity that  public representatives have to at least address these issues is welcome,  even if we do not have the power, at this stage, to do much about them. It is  good that three of the main parties are here &mdash; and the Alliance Party was here  earlier &mdash; but it is a matter of regret that, on an important issue of concern  to the public, Sinn F&eacute;in is missing. It saddens me that the Secretary of State  seems to give a veto to Sinn F&eacute;in on certain issues and that the party does not  participate in debates in this Chamber, yet it chides other parties, including  the DUP, for not seeking to make progress. It talks about the need for  engagement, yet it will not engage on these issues. That is highly regrettable.  Just as Sinn F&eacute;in abstains and absents itself from Westminster, it absents  itself from this place. Its contribution on these matters is sadly lacking.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">I turn to the issue of sport. With the World Cup coming to a conclusion and Wimbledon well on its  way, many people will have been watching sport. That is an area in which  we need to do more in Northern Ireland. Throughout  the period of the troubles, sport in Northern Ireland was an activity  that brought people together and it continues to bring people together across  the community. It is something that we need to invest in.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">We congratulate Italy and France on reaching the World Cup  final, and we look forward to a good game.</p>
  		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
  		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Donaldson</strong>:  Some of my happiest memories are of Northern Ireland doing well on two  occasions when it got through to the World Cup finals. We need to invest in  sport to get the best out of our sportsmen and sportswomen if Northern Ireland  is to get back into the World Cup finals. We need proper training facilities  and stadia.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">Since my election to Parliament, I have campaigned for a  national stadium. I have long believed that Northern Ireland needed a  first-class facility. The Government considered all the options about where the  new national stadium might be located; they have gone for the Maze site, which happens  to be in my constituency. I welcome that prospect.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">I wish that the debate would move on from location to the  type of facility that we need. We politicians gripe about the need for spending  money; the Government is offering the people of Northern Ireland a stadium, yet  some people seem to want to look that gift horse in the mouth. I do not; I want  to see the money used wisely, not only for this generation but for future  generations of sportsmen and sportswomen, and I look forward to the day when the  new stadium is open on the Maze site.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">I was disappointed and a little surprised that the Member  for South Antrim, Mr Burnside &mdash; who is no longer in his place &mdash; criticised the  Maze project and favoured Belfast. The debate on location has moved on, but  since Antrim and Newtownabbey, which are in his constituency, will form part of  the new council that includes the Maze, I am amazed that he, as a public  representative and an Assembly Member, should oppose  a proposal that will bring benefits to the rate&shy;payers whom he  represents. I am sure that the point will not be lost on the Member for South  Antrim, Rev Dr McCrea, who was victorious in  the elections in 2005.</p>
  		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  Will the Member confirm that all members of the Democratic Unionist Party,  wherever they are elected, share his  enthusiasm for the Maze site?</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyTextItalic">[Laughter.]</p>
  		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Donaldson</strong>:  The Member will know that the DUP, as with all democratic parties, has a  variety of opinions. The DUP, unlike the UUP, takes its seat on the Maze panel  and is fully engaged in the project because we see the benefit of it for all  the people of Northern Ireland. The leadership of the party decided that, since  the location of the stadium had been settled, we had to move on. I hope that  the Ulster Unionist Party will shortly join us on the panel and get on with the  job of creating this facility. The DUP is consistent on the issue and is not  sending out mixed signals, unlike the hon Member&rsquo;s party.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">Turning now, Madam Speaker, to the issue of education, I  join Members who today mentioned the South Eastern Education and Library Board,  which is of great concern to me. We talked today about democracy, yet here is  an example of dictatorship. The Secretary of State, the education Minister and  the Northern Ireland Office have decided that the democratically expressed  views of the elected representatives on the board are to be ignored. That is a  matter for regret.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">There are historical financial difficulties to which the  Member for east Belfast sketched the background, as did the Member for Strangford. It is simply not good enough  for the Government to introduce a commission into the South Eastern Education  and Library Board, without allowing the issue to be more fully explored. I  commend the councillors on that board: they have at heart the interests of the  people that they represent &mdash; especially funding for vulnerable children who  have special needs and funding for special needs schools.</p>
  		<p class="TimePeriod">3.30 pm</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">It is entirely wrong for the Government to proceed in such  a way.</p>
  		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Robinson</strong>:  Since I last spoke on this issue, I have realised that there is a very set  procedure with regard to appointments. There is a process whereby the  Commission has to clear appointments and, even in emergency circumstances, where it needs to be informed. Will the  hon Gentleman join me in calling for an open statement from the Government as  to whether they complied with the appointments system that they set out, and,  if they did not, that the appointments that have been made should be dissolved?</p>
  		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Donaldson</strong>:  The hon Member is absolutely right, and I thank him for making that point. We  have asked for an urgent meeting with the Education Minister, and that point  must be clarified there, because it smacks of a diktat. I listened to the  Govern&shy;ment&rsquo;s announcement last evening, and it was clear that the issue was  pre-cooked and pre-determined. They had already decided that they were going to  appoint commissioners and who they were going to be.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">It smacks of the kind of attitude that we have had from the  Government recently whereby, regardless of any political consensus, whether it  is on education, industrial derating, water charges, planning laws or other  issues, the Government will choose to ignore all that and simply press ahead  with their own agenda. They lecture us on the need to achieve political  consensus on the way forward, but when we do agree on issues that matter to the  people we represent, the Government choose to ignore it. That is regrettable.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">The Democratic Unionist Party is a devolutionist party, and  we want a devolved Administration back in Northern Ireland as soon as possible.  Mr Maginness said that he would go into  government if the opportunity arose &mdash; the key issue is how we determine  what that opportunity is. There is no difference of opinion on this side of the  Chamber about power sharing being the way forward. The hon Member should read  the DUP&rsquo;s manifesto. We went to the country on the basis that the only form of  government that would work in Northern Ireland is one that has the support of a  majority on both sides of the community. We have accepted that, and that must  mean that we work together in the Assembly to provide good government for the  people of Northern Ireland.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">The DUP would like to have moved forward immediately, and  we have put to the SDLP the idea of a voluntary coalition supported by other  parties in the Chamber. For its own reasons, the SDLP has decided that that is  not the way forward. Therefore, if the only way forward is in an inclusive  Executive, we need to know that everyone in that Executive meets the  requirements for a commitment to exclusively peaceful and democratic means. We  cannot afford to have another false dawn where we establish the Assembly and in  six months or a year&rsquo;s time it collapses again, because those who say that they  are committed to peace and democracy cannot help themselves and return to  criminality and involvement in violence and intimidation.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">That is why the DUP wants to finish the job. We want to  ensure that this time we get it absolutely right. We will not be tied down by  timetables and deadlines. It is important that we know that those who are in  government with us support the police, the rule of law and abide by the rules  of democracy. That is all that we ask, and I do not think that is a big ask of  any political party, that our partners in government should comply with the  rules of democracy.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">Let us work together to achieve that objective. It can be  achieved, but it will take a lot more determination than we have seen so far,  and it simply will not do for the Secretary of State to tell us to go into  government on 24 November and deal with the issues later: we need to deal with  them now.</p>
  		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dawson</strong>: I  am very disappointed by the SDLP&rsquo;s view that the inclusion of IRA/Sinn F&eacute;in in  the Executive would, in some way, be of economic benefit to Northern Ireland.  That view is not shared by the parties in the Republic of Ireland, who are in  no rush to include IRA/Sinn F&eacute;in in their Government, partly because of the  economic nonsense expressed by IRA/Sinn F&eacute;in in their policy documents. For  example, their document entitled &lsquo;Rights for All&rsquo; states that everyone has the  right to remuneration above the statutory minimum wage.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The damage potentially inflicted on our economy by  the comprehensive spending review would be as nothing compared to having Sinn  F&eacute;in in our Government trying to implement such a policy.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">Consider also Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s policy that there should be  universal public services funded through direct and progressive taxation. That  means that Sinn F&eacute;in is the party of high taxation. Its loud declaration  outside the Chamber that it opposes the imposition of local taxes is laid bare,  because it is the party of high taxation. Its stated policy is to increase tax,  undermine the private sector and destroy economic advance in Northern Ireland &mdash;  and, equally, in the Republic of Ireland.</p>
  		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  Is the hon Member saying that if Sinn F&eacute;in were to abandon its eccentric and  nonsensical economic policies, he would be willing to accept it into an  Administration?</p>
  		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dawson</strong>: Of course not. I share and am committed to the views of my  party. The Member is back in his dream world once again.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">It is also true that the only party standing in the way of  establishing an economic committee in this House is Sinn F&eacute;in, and Dr Farren  referred to that earlier. It seems that it has swapped its armed terrorism in  Northern Ireland for economic terrorism.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">With regard to the comprehensive spending review, one of  the pivotal questions that must be answered is not only what services are going  to be delivered, but how they will be delivered. We suffer from a huge amount  of red tape and bureaucracy in Northern Ireland, and Members have referred to  that already.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">In his speech to the Fabian Society, the Secretary of State  said that if &ldquo;education, education, education&rdquo; had been his Government&rsquo;s  mantra, Northern Ireland&rsquo;s mantra was &ldquo;bureaucracy, bureaucracy, bureaucracy&rdquo;.  Of course, he failed to point out that it was the same Government implementing  the bureaucracy here. I am sure that the Secretary of State would suggest that  he has dealt with Government bureaucracy in what he has ambitiously called his  &ldquo;quango cull&rdquo;. However, as they have already said, Members in this House would  disagree with him, given that over 60% of the unaccountable quangos will remain  in existence even after his alleged quango cull.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">Members will share the frustrations we have from time to time as each one of us tries to break  through the barriers of bureaucracy, inefficiency, unresponsiveness and,  sometimes, downright obstruction.</p>
  		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Nesbitt</strong>:  I am intrigued by a member of the DUP talking about getting rid of the quango  cult and its inefficiency. Perhaps he would explain &mdash; and I choose my words  very carefully so as to be accurate &mdash; why his party agreed in December 2004  that if any of its members became Ministers in an Executive, it would support  the creation of an all-Ireland civic forum and an all-Ireland parliamentary  forum, which are two quangos. I remind the Member that he was totally against a  Northern Ireland civic forum. I would like some clarification on the quango  dimension.</p>
  		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dawson</strong>: I  am quite happy to respond to that. The hon Member does not point out that in  December 2004 the DUP proposed an efficiency commission or panel that would  examine all of the efficiency issues in relation to the Belfast Agreement and  beyond, and, no doubt, we will return to that in the future.</p>
  		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Donaldson</strong>:  Does the Member agree that the two bodies that the hon Member for South Down  referred to are not quangos? Quangos are non-governmental organisations that  have powers, budgets, and so on: these are inter-parliamentary groups and not  quangos, and they do not meet the definition of a quango. Did this party, Madam  Speaker, not propose an efficiency commission to get rid of all the other  unelected quangos that are not needed?</p>
  		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dawson</strong>: I  thank the hon Member for his clarification. Given that time is moving on and  that I have several other points to make, I will continue.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">Whatever our political philosophies or party allegiances, I  trust that the House can agree that the role of Government ought to be to  deliver first-rate public services. All too often Government perceive that  their goal is to invent new bureaucracies, more red tape and increasingly  complex ways of governance, regardless of the costs.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">Granted, Government acknowledged that there was a problem and set up the review of public  administration (RPA), but the review, as established in 2000 by the then  Minister of the Environment from the Ulster Unionist Party, was fatally flawed  because it did not concentrate on the bloated bureaucracy born out of the  Belfast Agreement. My party has been alone in calling for a cull of superfluous  spending, and a reduction in the size of this Assembly and in the number of  Government Departments, along with other elements of our oversized central  Government. However, I am pleased to say that in recent times large sections of  the business community have risen to support our view&shy;point. It is utterly  unacceptable that, for no other reason than  the appeasement of selfish political interests, the people of Northern Ireland endure an Administration the size  and scale of which is unprecedented in the rest of the United Kingdom.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">Can it be right, for example, that in a population of 1&middot;7  million, there is an Assembly Member for every 15,700 constituents? Compare  that to the Welsh Assembly, where there is a Member for every 48,300  constituents. I appreciate that my remarks may well have a hint of turkeys  calling for Christmas &mdash; or, perhaps, given the Secretary of State&rsquo;s deadline,  turkeys calling for Thanksgiving.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">Likewise, with 11 Departments and provision for a twelfth,  our Administration dwarfs those of Scotland and Wales. The savings to be made  in those areas are far greater than any that will be generated by the RPA. In a  written answer to a parliamentary question asked by my party colleague Gregory  Campbell, the then Minister of the Environment, Angela Smith, said that the  savings from RPA would be between &pound;140 million and &pound;200 million &mdash; although I  note from Members&rsquo; comments today that the Government seem to be reneging on  that commitment. We have estimated that by cutting the size of Government and  Departments in Northern Ireland the expenditure saving could be in excess of  &pound;0&middot;5 billion. The Government of Northern Ireland, whether devolved or direct  rule, should be setting an example to the people of the Province. It is  unacceptable to demand ever-increasing amounts of revenue in the form of higher  rates, water charges or industrial rates to assist in funding for higher public  spending while simultaneously doing nothing to curtail the size and cost of the highest tiers of our Government. We  want investment in public services, but we do not want that investment to be  wasted in bureaucracy, structures and administrations.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">First and foremost, the Government must look at themselves  before asking the people to pay a single extra penny in rates or water charges.  Government have a duty to set an example by ensuring that bureaucracy, red tape  and administration are stripped back to the  bare minimum. Any restored Administration will face several hard  choices. I would suggest that cutting the cost of Government is not one of  them. That is an easy choice and not to take it would be a dereliction of duty.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">I note that we are approaching recess, and, in an effort to  encourage new experiences and attitudes, particularly among my colleagues  opposite &mdash;</p>
  		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>A Member</strong>:  And new dreams.</p>
  		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dawson</strong>: &mdash; new dreams and a better community for us all, I wish all  Members a very happy, peaceful and enjoyable Twelfth. I assure the Members  opposite that they would be very welcome at many of the demonstrations. To aid  the tourism in Mr Hillis&rsquo;s area I can assure him that that most unique part of  orangeism, the Independent Loyal Orange Institution, will be in Portrush on 12  July. I look forward to seeing him there.</p>
  		<p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
  		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  Adverts are not allowed.</p>
  		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr William  McCrea</strong>: I listened with care and interest to the speeches from Members on  the SDLP Benches, but Mr Maginness&rsquo;s &ldquo;I had a dream&rdquo; speech took the biscuit.  When I heard the Member for North Belfast utter those words, I thought that he  was about to break into a broad American accent. I was not sure, either,  whether he was going to continue in English or French, because he is used to  speaking both languages &mdash; or rather, speaking English with a French accent.  Nevertheless, I will continue in such a way that Mr Maginness will understand  everything that I say.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">The Secretary of State has shown a blatant disregard for  Members of this Assembly. Before the summer recess, Members wanted to discuss  and address a number of serious motions. However, the Secretary of State cast  all those motions aside to enable him to present us with a motion on which he  had decided. The motion is so wide-ranging that he knew that it would be  totally impossible to home in on every issue.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">However, it is important to mention some of those issues &mdash;  for example, health. Some hospitals are closing and others are recommended for  closure. Acute and maternity services are to be removed from the Mid-Ulster  Hospital and Whiteabbey Hospital. The community  has serious concerns: trolley waits in hospitals are a disgrace and the  waiting lists for operations are unbelievable. The Secretary of State must  listen to the voice of the community.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">It is interesting to note that the Secretary of State is  demanding consensus from all the political parties in Northern Ireland. Even if  that were achieved, the Secretary of State, or the Department of Health, Social  Services and Public Safety, would continue to do what they wanted to do. There  was consensus in mid-Ulster, but they were not willing to listen.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">There is supposed to be care in the community, but many older  people are blocking hospital beds when they could be in nursing homes in the  community. Many elderly people are traumatised because they no longer receive  the necessary attention. I pay tribute to all hospital staff who try to give  them that attention. However, many staff are  overworked and the Department of Health, Social Services and Public  Safety seems to care little for their rights or needs.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">The spending review also makes me think of education. The  building of a new high school in Magherafelt, a new Rainey Endowed School and a  new primary school has been announced. Promises have been made and budgets  committed, but I want to know when they will be built.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">When the Assembly was up and running, the controlled sector  was discriminated against. The Sinn F&eacute;in/IRA Minister discriminated against  those schools even though they were in his constituency. He was more concerned  about providing finances for, and meeting the needs of, the maintained and  integrated sectors. He completely closed his heart and mind to the needs of the  controlled sector, especially the Protestant and unionist community. That is an  absolute disgrace and an indictment on him.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">Direct rule Ministers have announced that those three new  schools will be built, and I want to ensure that  the money is committed and a commencement date set, so that the rights of those living and being educated in  deplorable and despicable conditions are the same as those in the maintained  and integrated sectors.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">Take, for example, the announcement that the new police  college, for which there great hopes and dreams, would be built in Cookstown.  It would not only be for Northern Ireland, but would serve an international  purpose. Yet, the Government has reneged on the financing of the project. All  the promises and hot air from the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and  those in authority will not provide the necessary finance. They must allocate  that money, and I appeal to the Secretary of State to listen to this House and  ensure that the new police college will be built. The site is excellent, and I  am absolutely thrilled that Cookstown was chosen, but we must have the bricks  and mortar; we must get the college up and running so that it can provide the  up-to-date police training and services that are required.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">We see throughout the Province the lack of infrastructure  in roads, water and sewerage. It is a disgraceful situation. It is true that in  the past, while England, Scotland and Wales had their infrastructures brought  up to a modern standard, in Northern Ireland the money was allocated to dealing  with the terrorist threat. We were denied the building of a proper  infrastructure, and now that we are light years behind the rest of the United  Kingdom, we are being asked to bear the burden of bringing those infrastructures  into the modern era.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">We have been waiting for the Magherafelt bypass for 35  years. Although there has been an acknowledge&shy;ment of the need for it &mdash; and I  am delighted with the work that my Colleagues Mr P Robinson and Mr Campbell did  as Ministers for Regional Development with the rural strategy to move that  forward &mdash; it must be put on the programme and given a date for commencement, as  must the Cookstown bypass.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">We need to face the challenges. There has been no great  injection of investment; neither Invest Northern Ireland nor its predecessors  sent many investors to those areas. However, instead of complaining, the people  there pulled themselves up by their bootstrings. Now they have practically the  lowest unemployment rate in Northern Ireland. That is to be commended &mdash; but let  us not strangle them. Let us ensure that the infrastructure is there to help  them move forward.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">There is an urgent need in Northern Ireland for social  housing, which seems to have gone by the board. The Government must take that issue  seriously, because there are many young people in Northern Ireland who, because  of the cost of housing, cannot afford to buy.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">Then we think of agriculture, which is the backbone of Ulster life, and affects every constituency.  But because of a lack of urgency in the Department of Agriculture and  Rural Development, many payments that should be made to farmers have been  withheld. Claims should be settled and the bureaucracy should be eradicated. No  one can underestimate or overstate the pain that has been suffered by the  farming community.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">There are many problems in the community.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">I heard SDLP Members say that somehow we could wave a magic  wand and devolution would be the answer. Let me make it abundantly clear: when  we had devolved Government, the Assembly recommended closing the Mid-Ulster  Hospital, the Whiteabbey Hospital and other hospitals in the west of the  Province.</p>
  		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  I ask the Member to draw his remarks to a close.</p>
  		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Rev Dr William  McCrea</strong>: I am doing so.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">It was that non-democratic Sinn F&eacute;in Minister who  recommended the destruction of our good grammar-school education in the  Province.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, we face challenges. We want devolution, but we  are not willing to put terrorists, hoods and gangsters into Government. We have  to be sure that we will have a restored  democratic Government in Northern Ireland  and that the day of criminality and paramilitarism is finished  completely and that we are moving forward on the solid basis of democracy  alone.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
  		<p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly notes the results of the Spending Review  2004 and the Current Comprehensive Spending Review 2007 and their implications  for the spending priorities for a Programme for Government to be agreed by a  Northern Ireland Executive following its restoration on or before 24 November  2006.</p>
  		<p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Madam Speaker</strong>:  I shall refer the decision of the Assembly to the Secretary of State by sending  him a note of the debate and of what has happened.</p>
  		<p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Adjourned at 3.56 pm.</p>
