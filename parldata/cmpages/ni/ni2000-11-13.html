                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Speaker. I wish to
                speak against this motion to suspend Standing Orders. This is
                setting a precedent that is totally improper at the start of the
                Programme for Government. We are committed to family-friendly
                working hours and childcare. It is not a good idea to suspend
                Standing Orders to allow us to speak beyond six o’clock
                tonight. This debate is important and could have been extended
                into Wednesday. It is totally improper for this House to suspend
                Standing Orders, defeating our proud achievement of securing
                family-friendly working hours for this Assembly.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the Member wishes to speak, it is possible
                for her to be called to speak. Of course, other Members would
                then have to be given the opportunity to give their views and
                the proposer would have to be given the opportunity to respond.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Speaker, will you
                rule on the issue? It has been suggested that there is some
                impropriety in the proposal. Surely it is quite in order and
                perfectly proper. If the Assembly wishes to take extra time to
                debate an issue, it should be allowed to do so, and there is
                provision for that in Standing Orders.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no question of its not being
                perfectly proper. In fact, this has occurred on a number of
                occasions. Standing Orders are there to facilitate good order,
                but also to facilitate the work of the Assembly. There are
                occasions when the business managers judge that the better
                function of the Assembly can be achieved by a suspension of
                Standing Orders, in particular Standing Orders which refer to
                timing and so forth. However, if it is the case that Members
                wish to speak to it, they may speak to it. If the Member wishes
                to speak, I will give her the opportunity to speak. If other
                Members so wish, they must also be given the opportunity to
                speak, and the proposer must have an opportunity to respond.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Morrice:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will be happy to withdraw the word
                &quot;improper&quot; and replace it with
                &quot;inappropriate&quot;.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am sure that most Members will appreciate
                the struggle we had in the Standing Orders Committee to secure
                family-friendly working hours for this Assembly when it was
                originally established. People wondered how we could do the
                business of Government on a nine-to-five basis. We asked
                &quot;Why not?&quot;</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The cut-off at six o’clock on Mondays was a
                huge leap forward for the family-friendly approach to working
                hours. Not only does it allow the men and women of this Assembly
                to go home to their families at six o’clock; it also allows
                women greater access to public life and to this Assembly. We can
                start the business of Government earlier at 10.30 am, rather
                than in the afternoon and into the night, with decisions being
                made late at night when we are tired, instead of early in the
                morning when we are refreshed and prepared to work.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Why did the Business Committee not consider
                the Programme for Government important enough to go beyond
                Monday into Tuesday and Wednesday? Standing Orders allow us to
                work through Tuesday evening, rolling over to Wednesday morning.
                The Programme for Government is vital for the Assembly and its
                work in Northern Ireland.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Did the Member or her party propose this at
                the Business Committee? Did her party vote against it at the
                Business Committee? Is not the Business Committee the place to
                do it, rather than in the House?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Morrice:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We would oppose this in the Business
                Committee. However, had we done so, I doubt we would have had
                the opportunity to win the debate. I am doing the democratic
                thing: standing in the Assembly and calling on Members to vote
                against the motion. It sets a precedent of extending the working
                hours set out in Standing Orders at the whim of the Assembly. We
                must also take into account the option of continuing this debate
                into Tuesday and Wednesday. I ask Members to consider
                family-friendly working hours and the importance of the debate
                and vote against the motion.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order. The Member’s suggestion that the
                debate be continued into Tuesday and Wednesday raises a matter
                of order. That proposition is not available at present. Were
                Standing Orders not suspended, I would be required to put the
                Question at six o’clock. The debate could not continue beyond
                that time, and the motion would be voted on at that stage.
                Continuing into Tuesday or Wednesday is not a possibility at
                this stage. That is simply a matter of order that I need to draw
                to the Member’s attention.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Morrice:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I ask Members to vote against the motion and
                put our achievements on family-friendly working hours before our
                ability to go beyond the limit of our working hours at six o’clock.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dodds:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When this matter was raised in the Business
                Committee, there was unanimity on the need for an extended
                period of time to debate this very important issue. We support
                the suspension of Standing Orders in this case in order to
                facilitate extra debate. It would certainly be an issue if
                Standing Orders were suspended, or if there were a motion to
                suspend them, in order to curtail debate or prevent Members from
                having their say on an issue of concern to them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion before the House will allow
                Members to have their say on an extremely important issue. It is
                invidious and wrong for a Member whose party did not raise any
                objections to the motion or speak against it at the Business
                Committee to raise the matter now on the Floor of the House in
                this fashion. There are proper channels through which to do
                this, and they have not been observed. I can see no worthy
                grounds on which the Member’s proposal should succeed.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall make one brief comment. I discourage
                the House from entertaining discussions on the Floor of the
                Chamber about what may or may not have happened in the Business
                Committee, given that discussions through the usual channels are
                usually best kept in that context. That applies both to those
                who raise questions and to those who respond. It is best if the
                matter can be dealt with there.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It may be useful if I outline how I hope to
                facilitate this debate. To provide for the discussion of
                thematic issues, it has been agreed through the usual channels
                that we divide consideration of the draft programme into three
                sections.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After the First Minister and the Deputy First
                Minister propose the motion, section one will deal with chapters
                one, six and seven of the Programme for Government, covering the
                overall approach including external relations and style of
                operation. Section two will deal with chapters two and three
                covering equality, human rights, poverty and health. Finally,
                section three will cover the issues in chapters four and five,
                education, training, the economy and infrastructure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While there will be three sections to the
                debate, the normal Standing Order, 17(2), will still apply and a
                Member may not speak more than once to a single motion, except
                for the Member who is moving the motion or winding up the
                debate. Members called during a particular section should speak
                to that section. However, they may make comments about any other
                part of the draft Programme for Government when they are called
                to speak. Indeed, if they have comments to make they will have
                to make them at that time as they will not be given a second
                opportunity to speak.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">10.45 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To facilitate the debate, at the start of
                each section I will call a Minister to speak, and at the end of
                a section I will again call a Minister, or Ministers, who may
                wish to comment on matters raised. All Members, including
                Ministers, but excluding the First Minister and the Deputy First
                Minister, will have the same amount of time, because I have had
                a large number of requests to speak. I have looked at those
                requests, and the indications from some Whips of the number of
                Members who wish to speak — although the indications I get at
                the start and end of debates often bear little relation to each
                other, which makes it hard to judge.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With 10 minutes for both the First Minister
                and the Deputy First Minister to open, there will not be more
                than five minutes for each other Member, including the
                Ministers, to speak during the debate — even with the
                extension into the evening. Had the previous motion fallen,
                there would have been even less time available.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I must rule that the First Minister and
                Deputy First Minister will have 10 minutes each to open, and
                time to wind at the end if they so choose. For the rest of the
                debate, those called will have five minutes. I trust that is
                clear. It is an unusual debate, but we are trying to work as
                closely within the Standing Orders as possible. If Members are
                clear, we will proceed.</p>

                will guide the public spending plans for 2001-02 in the Budget;
                notes that the Programme for Government will be presented for
                the approval of the Assembly in the New Year, embracing public
                service agreements for all Departments.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today’s debate on the draft Programme for
                Government is, arguably, the most important business we have
                transacted since this Assembly came into existence. That might
                seem a bold assertion, and I acknowledge that the debate may
                well lack some of the political pyrotechnics of other occasions,
                but it is, in my opinion, the most important meeting we have had
                to date. I say that because this debate represents the beginning
                of the maturity of the new politics that the agreement has
                achieved for Northern Ireland. It is, or ought to be, a new
                beginning.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Programme for Government hopes to
                represent a contract between this Assembly and its Executive,
                and the people of Northern Ireland. It represents a statement of
                the policies and objectives we have identified as our main
                priorities for the months and years ahead. It will act as a road
                map, describing the direction in which the Executive hopes to
                take our public services. In this programme we have the coming
                to maturity of the work of devolved Government in Northern
                Ireland. It is our opportunity to start making a difference, to
                begin to put behind us the sterility and neglect of direct rule
                and to apply our imagination and energies to the good of all our
                people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A number of Ministers will speak in greater
                detail about the aspects of the Programme for Government. The
                Deputy First Minister and I will speak in more general terms,
                providing an overview of the programme as a whole.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our objective is to deliver a new beginning
                for Government in Northern Ireland — a Government that is
                responsive to the community it serves and in tune with the
                people who elected it. It will be a Government that will seek to
                provide new and better public services and opportunities for the
                whole community, Protestant, Catholic, those of other religions
                or of none. It will seek to provide new and better public
                services and opportunities for Unionists, Nationalists,
                Republicans and those of no particular political conviction,
                males, females, the young as well as the elderly, those of
                British or Irish descent and those who have only more recently
                come to live among us.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive will endeavour to provide real,
                meaningful and effective Government for all of the people who
                make up our community. In doing so, we hope to see this
                community grow in its self-confidence and its economic and
                social well-being — a community that no longer looks
                exclusively in on itself but which is sufficiently confident to
                look beyond its own shores and play its part in the wider world,
                whether through business, education, culture or other
                endeavours.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The aim is to produce a Northern Ireland at
                ease with itself, an inclusive Northern Ireland, where all can
                feel they belong and where all can enjoy equal esteem. We also
                want to construct a more prosperous Northern Ireland, where
                everyone enjoys equality of opportunity and to move towards a
                world where there are jobs for all who are capable of work. We
                wish to help society to become more outward-looking, more
                confident about learning from others and more assured that it
                has much to contribute to the rest of the world.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Programme for Government also
                demonstrates that the diverse parties which constitute the
                Executive have been fully able to work together constructively
                for the benefit of Northern Ireland. That co-operation is
                important in itself, but it is not enough. The final judgement
                on this programme will be made on the basis of what it achieves
                and whether what it contains can indeed make a difference to the
                lives of people across Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The kernel of the programme is a list of 230
                actions which the Executive propose to take after consultation
                and a vote in the Assembly. Many of these actions are specific
                and costed — policies for which funds are provided in the
                draft Budget, which the Assembly will also consider. Members
                will want to consider the details of these actions. All have
                budgetary implications, so any proposed changes need to be
                reflected in the consideration of the Budget, which we will
                debate tomorrow.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a great deal we wish to change,
                improve and develop, but major changes need to be carefully
                planned and require wide consultation. That is why the programme
                contains 15 reviews of policy covering a wide range of issues
                from selection in education to safety on the roads. As these
                reviews report and are implemented, we believe that the face of
                Northern Ireland will begin to change for the better and that
                the pace of change will accelerate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The programme sets out the intentions of the
                Administration, and it is important that those aims are
                delivered quickly and effectively. Members and the wider public
                need assurance that the large amounts of taxpayers’ money
                being deployed here actually improve the services that people
                need. Our determination is to deliver the programme effectively
                and to be seen to be doing so, and that is reflected in an
                important administrative innovation, the public service
                agreements, to which all Departments will attach targets and
                timetables for their actions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These public service agreements are being
                worked up and will be presented to the Assembly in the next
                debate on this programme. Their aim is to deliver more and
                better services to the public and to provide better value for
                money. As we said in our statement on 24 October 2000, these
                agreements will form a contract between individual Departments
                and the Executive. They will provide the transparency and
                accountability which was not adequately provided for under
                direct rule. They will form an important part of our new way of
                doing business, and they will create a culture change within the
                Government, focusing managers’ attention not merely on the
                inputs of financial resources but on the outputs of real
                services delivered to real people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are determined to improve the
                effectiveness of the Government, and this is reflected in the
                provisions contained in the programme to achieve joined-up
                Government. A joined-up approach was built in to the development
                of this programme, and, in particular, it defines our priority
                areas for action. We will develop this approach in the Executive’s
                own work, with Ministers working in sub-committees to develop
                cross-cutting policies in a much more coherent way and to ensure
                that a silo mentality does not inhibit their delivery.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Hence also our strong focus on the Executive’s
                programme funds. These are to be organised and agreed by the
                Executive as a whole. They will enable us to carry out much more
                effective cross-cutting work. They will also enable us to deal
                with major infrastructure and rural projects, to focus on the
                needs of children and to work on developing new policies in
                important areas, on improving the quality of service and on
                tackling the issue of social inclusion and community
                regeneration. In addition, as set out in the final chapter,
                there are a number of cross-cutting initiatives that can improve
                the effectiveness of the Government. These include the increased
                use of electronics to create new and more effective means of
                providing services to and information for citizens and to handle
                data and information within the Government. We also need to link
                this to the reform of public administration. We hope to have
                more details on the review in the coming months.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must face up to the significant problems
                of finance too. We need to tackle the weaknesses of the Barnett
                formula, which does not always meet our needs. On the other
                hand, our ability to find innovative ways to finance public
                services must be integral to this strategy. We must examine if,
                for example, public-private partnerships and the private finance
                initiative are practical solutions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Having dealt with those matters in general
                terms, I now invite the Deputy First Minister to give more
                detail on some aspects of the Programme for Government.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister (Mr Mallon):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister has emphasised that the
                Programme for Government is an exercise in joined-up Government.
                It flows from the collective reflection and responsibility of
                the Executive and not from the entrenched individual interests
                of Departments. The Executive’s programme funds are perhaps
                the strongest example in the Programme for Government of our
                commitment to innovate and break away from traditional
                departmental approaches. The development by the Executive of a
                clarity of purpose, an overall vision and priorities and
                sub-priorities provides the framework within which Departments
                will implement the 230 actions through the operation of public
                service agreements. The Programme for Government has been
                constructed to unlock the energies and realise the economies
                that become possible when Departments and agencies work together
                to achieve an interlocking set of aims.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One important aspect of coherence was our
                determination to ensure that the concept of equality ran through
                the draft programme. Our commitment to equality is a promise to
                every citizen that he or she shall share in basic human dignity.
                This dignity rests not on possessions or position, but on the
                right to be treated as a person with opportunities equal to
                those of all others. Chapter 2 has a major focus on this theme,
                but equality will be delivered in all the programme’s areas.
                We hope, for example, to provide high quality education with
                equal access to all and tackle the unacceptable levels of ill
                health, which are closely linked with social disadvantage,
                through a public health strategy. These are two key objectives
                for this Administration. I believe that we have threaded
                equality into every relevant aspect of the draft programme. We
                look forward, at this consultative stage of the process, to
                taking account of the views of the equality groups and the
                Equality Commission.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A second element that has run through our
                thinking is realism: facing up to the real challenges that we
                face with the resources at our disposal and hence the parallel
                of the Programme for Government and the Budget. Not everything
                can be achieved as rapidly as we would like. We would like to do
                more in every area, and we are sure that the Assembly would wish
                to do more. For example, no one is content with the progress we
                are making in tackling Northern Ireland’s waiting list for
                health care and community services. Nor can we be satisfied with
                any of the objectives and targets that are in the Programme for
                Government. However, we must be frank about the reality, even as
                we aspire to overcome all of those problems. Let us not forget
                either that each year we will present an updated programme which
                will allow us to modify our approach in the light of experience.
                In the words of President Dwight Eisenhower,</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Plans are nothing, planning is
                everything.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will now say a few words about the
                challenges which we face, especially those for which the First
                Minister and the Deputy First Minister have a particular
                responsibility. We have to face the reality of deep divisions in
                our society. It cannot be otherwise after centuries of division
                and 30 years of conflict. In particular, we recognise the need
                to put in place a cross-departmental strategy to promote
                community relations. New thinking, new energy and above all
                moral and political support must be given to this crucial
                activity. The promotion of a cohesive, inclusive and just
                society is a particular challenge for us, but it also applies to
                all modern societies as they deal with economic restructuring,
                growing individualism and the weakening of their traditional
                social institutions.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.00 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We identified a healthy society with a future
                for young people as a society that provides educational
                opportunities for all and creates jobs in the new economy —
                the key social issues to be addressed. Looking at the physical
                backdrop to economic and social activity, we identified the
                importance of a sustainable environment, the need for a new
                focus on the rural economy and the creation of a renewed
                infrastructure after the under-investment in recent years as
                major priorities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, there is the need to shape a society
                which will develop relationships and interact successfully with
                its neighbours — on this island, throughout Britain and
                worldwide. Chapters 2-6 of the document set out the detailed
                sub-priorities, programmes and actions that respond to those
                challenges. In our discussions in the Executive, we considered a
                variety of ways in which we could have described those
                priorities. Our conclusion was that we should limit the priority
                areas to five, each with a very broad approach. We decided that
                organising our work around those five priority areas, producing
                greater overall coherence for our policies while having a wider
                number of sub-priorities, would produce the right balance.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But public policy is not an exact science. We
                are a new Administration, operating in unique circumstances,
                trying to break new ground. We are open to hear Members’ views
                on whether this balance is correct or whether there are
                significant issues that need greater emphasis and future
                development.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Chapter 6 covers the fifth priority, namely
                ‘Developing North/South, East/West and International Relations’.
                There we have set out the ways in which the Executive will seek
                to work with other Governments and bodies such as the European
                Commission to realise the full potential of enhanced
                co-operation and maximise the benefit to Northern Ireland. The
                development of the global economy, the development of the
                European Union and the nature of many policy areas such as the
                environment, which, in essence, know no boundaries, require us
                to work on a much wider canvas than just that of Northern
                Ireland. Members may be interested to know that we have already
                sent copies of the draft Programme for Government to all of the
                Administrations with which we interact.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need to seek the benefits of co-operation
                on the North/South, east-west axes as well as internationally.
                Whatever the short-term difficulties — and they must be
                overcome as quickly as possible — the Executive, as set out in
                the Programme for Government, are fully committed to taking
                forward the work of the North/South Ministerial Council.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I pay tribute to those Ministers and
                officials who have worked hard to get the new North/South bodies
                up and running. With devolution, we now have the opportunity to
                make our views known and to play our part with neighbouring
                Governments for our mutual benefit. While there is a wide range
                of east-west issues to develop, we have identified transport and
                the fuel tax problem as matters of particular importance to
                Northern Ireland. In addition, we will develop more effective
                links with the European institutions by establishing an office
                in Brussels, and we will develop our presence in north America.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, we pointed to the important work
                that we need to do to improve the international image of
                Northern Ireland — we all know the legacy that our history has
                left in this area. If we are to prosper and gain investment and
                tourism, it is important that we act in a coherent way to
                improve our image.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I finish by emphasising the importance we
                place on the Assembly’s views and those of the wider
                community. I am disappointed that, to date, there has been a
                relevant absence of public analysis and discussion about the
                Programme for Government. I hope that today’s debate,
                involving so many Ministers and Back-Benchers, will help to
                stimulate wider discussion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The draft programme was prepared by the
                Executive and is a document for which the Executive take
                responsibility. It provides the best structure for taking our
                work forward and for the important budgetary decisions that must
                be made next month. It is also a programme developed and
                approved through the Assembly process. The Executive look to
                Members for help to frame the document and guide its annual
                development. The agreement places responsibilities on us all to
                work in new ways to create a new approach.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ours is a new and unique style of politics,
                and the programme must play a central role in this process. It
                is a working, developing document that must, and will, evolve.
                The input and approval of all Members is essential for the
                achievement of that evolution.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Carson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the
                Programme for Government. It is another milestone on the road to
                developing good government in Northern Ireland. There are many
                hurdles to pass in order to overcome the legacy of direct rule
                and stagnated legislation and catch up with the remainder of the
                United Kingdom. Years of underinvestment are making it difficult
                in all Departments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To most people, environmental issues relate
                only to birds, bees and trees, but in the Programme for
                Government, environmental issues cut across all Departments. On
                page 12, paragraph 1.8, ‘A Better Environment’ and paragraph
                1.9, ‘A New Basis for the Rural Economy’ are worth reading,
                and I ask Members to read them. I was struck by the use of the
                word &quot;sustainability&quot; in paragraph 1.8. It is used
                many times throughout the document with regard to built
                heritage, natural heritage, agriculture, economy, rural life,
                countryside, air, land, and water quality. We must latch on to
                this term.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The awareness of sustainability is common to
                the rest of the United Kingdom. On 24 September, Lord Dubs
                emphasised the value of embedding nature conservation into other
                policy areas — particularly agriculture support and
                countryside management. He also said that the ability to achieve
                that would be an important test of whether things were
                developing in a sustainable way.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are some high sounding words in the
                Programme for Government. Paragraph 6.9 on page 83 states</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;A high quality environment and a modern
                water and sewerage network will be of benefit to everyone&quot;.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That sounds good but requires flesh on the
                words.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Page 54 states that the Executive will</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;assist district councils in
                implementing acceptable measures for the disposal of
                waste&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How are the Executive going to do that? What
                direction will be given? Will district councils be given
                direction with advice and financial help? I am sure that
                councillors are awaiting an explanation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Page 54 also states that the Executive will</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;maintain effective arrangements for the
                treatment and disposal of sewage and sewerage sludge&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is just not good enough to maintain the
                status quo. I wish to see treatment for phosphates in place at
                all sewage disposal works.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Page 54 also states that by the end of 2001
                there will be a strategy in place which will, through advice and
                research, seek to reduce eutrophication levels. That conflicts
                with the action to maintain existing sewage treatment and
                disposal. Anyone living near Lough Neagh will be aware of that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Pages 50 and 51 mention tourism. I welcome
                the fact that a start has been made to develop the different
                aspects of it. In paragraph&nbsp;5.3.3 it states that in 2001
                there will be a launch of water-based tourism programmes.
                However, it also states that by March&nbsp;2003 a strategy will
                be prepared to develop the recreational potential of inland
                waterways as a tourist attraction. It is rather difficult to
                understand what is meant by this. Surely strategy preparation
                comes before action. A clear direction of action is required.
                Will that happen in 2001 or in 2003?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The word &quot;sustainability&quot; is used
                throughout the document. However, sustainability will be
                impossible if the funding for a sustainable environment is not
                made available. I noticed that bids for environmental programmes
                were not met and that therefore work on landscape protection and
                nature conservation will not be undertaken. The funding needed
                for sustainable built heritage has not been met, and this will
                have a detrimental knock-on effect on bids to other funding
                bodies such as the Heritage Lottery Fund. If the Programme for
                Government is to be effective on the issue of environmental
                sustainability —</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the draft programme, but there are
                many areas that require much more work.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Gallagher:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I commend the Executive for bringing together
                the draft Programme for Government and for the consultation
                prior to its implementation. There are several key areas that I
                want to highlight.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the proposed
                Housing&nbsp;Bill, I am concerned about the introduction of a
                discretionary grants system in Northern&nbsp;Ireland. Such a
                system would leave the grants budget vulnerable. It would also
                be a difficult system to implement as regards the setting of
                eligibility criteria. This model, as implemented in England, is
                unsatisfactory, especially for those who live in unfit dwellings
                and are in dire need of improvements to their homes. The motto
                should be: if the system is not broken, why fix it?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are two important exceptions to that.
                It is particularly important in my constituency of Fermanagh and
                South&nbsp;Tyrone that the matter of closing orders be reviewed.
                There must be a better way of dealing with the situation where
                the only option considered by the Housing&nbsp;Executive for
                many deserving cases is to place a closing order on a lived-in
                house just because the resident was not aware of the fine print
                in the application. We have the highest level of unfit housing
                in the British&nbsp;Isles. It is currently 17·5%, which is more
                than twice the Northern&nbsp;Ireland average. Since&nbsp;1997,
                307&nbsp;properties have been subjected to closing orders in
                Northern Ireland, and 171 of those have been in Fermanagh. It is
                imperative that a more adaptable form of legislation is
                introduced for replacement grants. Also, under new legislation,
                all previous refusals should be reviewed to see if some of the
                deserving cases can be reconsidered for grant aid. After all,
                the Programme for Government states, among other things, that
                decent living accommodation will be provided for everyone.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The other grants issue that needs to be
                addressed is the eligibility requirement for minor works grants.
                The applicant must be on income support and must be over 60.
                There are many people outside that category who need repairs to
                their homes, but they find themselves excluded, particularly
                since the major cuts were introduced in the amounts payable for
                repair grants on the foot of environmental health notices.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the strong commitments to ensure
                that the Health Service caters for the needs of different users,
                irrespective of their backgrounds, and to modernise and improve
                hospital and primary care services. I want to see that
                commitment, particularly in respect of acute medical care,
                delivered at the Erne and South Tyrone hospitals. As I
                emphasised to the Minister of Health, the people of Fermanagh
                and South Tyrone are as entitled to these services as the people
                of Belfast, because the real test of rural proofing will be in
                the delivery of a decent health service to rural areas.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.15 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A further requirement for rural areas, and
                particularly for my constituency, is out-of-hours GP (general
                practitioner) cover. Presently, some people on the periphery
                have to travel up to 45 miles to get access to a GP after hours.
                While we all recognise that GPs need some time off, patients
                require a more amenable medical service. The Department should
                explore this issue in a cross- border context with the
                Department of Health in the South. We must find better
                arrangements, whereby GPs have their time off and the public has
                a satisfactory service.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With only five minutes at one’s disposal
                there is no time for detailed consideration of the Programme for
                Government. There is time only for a broad sweep of its content.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I listened to the First Minister and the
                Deputy First Minister speak, I felt there was a real danger that
                they are starting to believe their own rhetoric. It was very
                high in its waffle content; indeed, almost as high as the
                Programme for Government itself.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Here is a Programme for Government that is
                full of platitudes and padding and general concepts and
                clichés, that are mainly shibboleths, but have very little
                substance. Everyone, as they go through the 80 pages of this
                Programme for Government — this first effort of devolution —
                will recognise that it is 90% packaging and 10% content.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The people of Northern Ireland are looking
                for more than just grand visions and fine words. They want to
                see something tangible happening on the ground; they want to see
                real proposals that will change their lives, rather than all
                this candyfloss that has been thrown into the Programme for
                Government. I recognise that there are great difficulties in a
                power-sharing arrangement. In any other Government, parties
                produce their manifestos; people vote for something to happen;
                and when the party that they have voted for is elected, they
                expect to see the outpouring of the manifesto commitments that
                have been made. However, when people have been elected with
                different manifestos, promising different and often
                contradictory objectives, clearly people do not get what they
                voted for, and a mishmash results.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This programme has been a year in the making.
                Governments at Westminster are ready to put forward programmes
                for Government within days of being elected. The same is true of
                the Republic, while Scotland took a matter of weeks. Here, we
                had to wait about two years — they certainly had the best of
                two years to think about it — only to get what is a very
                disappointing effort.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It really suffers from the &quot;Nationalist
                psyche&quot; syndrome, something that Unionists have noticed in
                previous negotiations. When Unionists go into negotiations, they
                want to do a deal. They want to get down to brass tacks and
                discuss specific proposals.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">But not Nationalists — they come in and
                want to analyse everything. They then want to set out a whole
                series of principles, and once they catch people on their
                concepts and principles, there is only one conclusion left. I do
                not know whether the First Minister and his Colleagues have
                recognised that this is precisely what they have fallen into
                with this Programme for Government, particularly in the area of
                North/Southery. The Executive have produced a Programme for
                Government where North/Southery permeates almost every aspect of
                Government. It is oozing out of every pore of the Government. I
                think that the Unionist community in general will be very
                concerned when it starts to look at the detail.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The one point that I do agree with the Deputy
                First Minister on is in hoping that the public debate starts on
                this Programme for Government. I hope that people start to
                analyse what the Programme for Government is and where the
                Government are intending to take us all. The sorry specimen in
                front of us has very few innovative ideas in it. Because they
                want to show themselves as being dynamic and part of the whole
                development of the society, they look to the young and to
                economic development. The greatest disappointment for me is that
                there is no section for our senior citizens. There is nothing
                for them, apart from a few exceptions such as the proposal for
                free fares. I found it interesting —</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In my remarks today I want to concentrate on
                the role of the First Minister. When the Programme for
                Government was launched, our party detailed its views on it,
                covering both the positive areas and those areas we have
                reservations about. I listened with amusement to Mr Peter
                Robinson of the DUP. His party has had no part in any
                negotiations at any time in the last eight or nine years, and
                yet he can stand outside the process and complain about it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Programme for Government was launched
                here on Tuesday 24 October, and the Executive met that Thursday.
                The leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, on the very same day,
                wrote to the delegates of the Ulster Unionist Council. Here is
                the rub. We have to decide whether the Government is here or
                whether it is vested in the Ulster Unionist Council, which has
                met 22 times and which has threatened matters again, with yet
                another meeting planned for January. In his letter the First
                Minister said — and I paraphrase — that what is required is
                an exit strategy with a re-entry strategy. He accused his
                opponents in the party of having an exit strategy without a
                re-entry strategy. He then went on to give notice that he would
                outline a considered response involving suspension. He said that
                suspension was preferable and the only way to make progress —</p>

                concentrate first of all on those aspects of the Programme for
                Government that are in the section under debate. That is what I
                have encouraged. I cannot stop Members ranging widely over the
                content of the Programme for Government, and I guess that some
                Members will want to make comments about the programme as a
                whole.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given that they have only five minutes in
                which to do so, I think they would be wise to focus on the
                content. I will allow Members a fair degree of latitude within
                their five minutes, since the Programme for Government is
                wide-ranging in both its purpose and its content. Please
                continue, Mr Adams.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Adams:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thank you. I am dealing with the
                sustainability of this experiment. I am dealing with the
                sustainability of these institutions and, among other things, I
                am dealing with the refusal of the First Minister to nominate
                Sinn Féin members and with his taking away of the cross-border,
                all-Ireland strand. These are supposed to be interlocked and
                interdependent.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am also dealing with the other demands
                which have been put forward by the First Minister; for example,
                a call for a moratorium on policing as well as a demand to
                change the remit of the decommissioning body, neither of which
                is within the authority of this Assembly or the office of the
                First Minister. I make all of these points because this is not
                joined-up Government. You cannot have an Executive or an
                Assembly putting together the type of Programme for Government
                which we are debating here today if the First Minister has
                already commenced an exit strategy and if — in his own words
                — he differs only from his party political opponents on a
                matter of tactics. In other words, he thinks they will collapse
                the institutions, and it will not be possible to put them back
                in place, while he simply wants to suspend them so that they can
                be restored.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The answer has to be made very clear. Any
                Government must be a Government of equals. That is of paramount
                importance. This Assembly has to be based on the principle of
                equality: the rights of all citizens, whether we disagree with
                them or not, must be cherished. All citizens have to have due
                entitlement to have their rights upheld — and they have to
                have their rights upheld by the First Minister. I want to appeal
                to the First Minister today to review, to reconsider, to step
                back from the process which he has commenced, because the only
                conclusion to what he has begun will see not just the suspension
                of these political institutions, but their collapse.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ford:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We will have to put the Programme for
                Government to the test to see how well it deals with the entire
                range of problems which affect this society. There is no doubt
                that the draft programme is long; it is detailed; it is even
                specific in places, and perhaps it is a good start on
                socio-economic policies. If, as Mr Peter Robinson suggested,
                this were Wales or Scotland, we could, perhaps, give the
                Executive seven out of 10 for a moderate start — although we
                might have to deduct a few marks for the length of time it took
                to hand in its homework.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Despite the agreement, the fundamental
                problem that we in this Assembly have to face is the deep
                division in our society, and it is in that respect that the
                programme is sadly lacking. When my party launched its
                alternative Programme for Government last month, we highlighted
                a central theme which we determined as &quot;sharing over
                separation&quot;. While the Executive’s draft programme does
                have many positive policy suggestions, it fails to address
                fundamentally the divisions in this society — divisions which,
                if they are not addressed, could well destroy the agreement and
                the institutions. Having listened to the last two Members who
                spoke, I think that is evident.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am concerned about health, education,
                agriculture, the environment and railways, but we will never
                deal with those if the Executive do not do something to address
                the real problem which we have to face. It starts off quite
                well; on page 10 there is a nice piece of rhetoric:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;We must promote a just society where
                everyone enjoys equality of opportunity, whatever their
                religion, gender, ethnic origin and personal background.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">and it continues. This is fine rhetoric, but
                if you wade through the full programme, you will emerge
                wondering what the plans actually are. Section 2.5 is supposed
                to deal with that. There are only seven points in it, but not
                one has a target attached to it. The flowery rhetoric belies the
                fact that there are no specific targets to promote community
                relations and sharing over separation, and that is the
                fundamental weakness — the utterly key weakness — in the way
                the programme has been put together.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.30 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us look at some of the possibilities. My
                party has called for the number of pupils in integrated
                education to be boosted to 10% by 2010 through the
                transformation of existing schools. The Programme for Government
                has one weak reference to integrated education: one line in 85
                pages. We have called for measures to aid the integration of
                public housing. The Programme for Government does not mention
                promoting mixed housing at all. We have called for more funding
                for community relations projects, and, while there are certainly
                gestures in that direction, there is no detailed strategy for
                improving community relations. One would have thought that after
                a year of working on a Programme for Government, we might have
                seen something on that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the summer, we had complaints in this
                Chamber, outside in the streets and in every local newspaper
                about the proliferation of paramilitary flags and emblems in
                housing estates and on public property throughout Northern
                Ireland. Where are the measures in the Programme for Government
                to condemn that kind of intimidation? I cannot find them. There
                is a need for new shared symbols in Northern Ireland. Last week,
                the problems caused by a lack of shared symbols were
                demonstrated, but there is nothing in the programme about it. My
                party has called for all Government policies to be proofed to
                ensure that they promote sharing over separation. There are no
                plans for that in the Programme for Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of course, targeting social need is
                important, as are rural proofing and compliance with human
                rights legislation, but what about the biggest divide in this
                society? Where does the Programme for Government address it? It
                simply does not. All kinds of issues are missing. Where is the
                &quot;green economy&quot; task force? Where are specific
                problems addressed, as opposed to bleating about the Barnett
                formula, on funding for Northern Ireland as well as Wales and
                Scotland? Where is the proposal for a children’s commissioner?
                What about student finance? What about freedom-of-information
                legislation? I have asked about that in this Chamber and have
                been told nothing very much.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those matters are all important, but the
                priority remains building a shared society. George Holyoake, the
                nineteenth- century radical publisher, once said that a liberal
                is one who seeks to secure for everyone the same rights that he
                asks for himself. In this place, we have turned things on their
                head. I stand here as a liberal demanding for myself the rights
                that the two major sections of this society have taken for
                themselves but denied to every other minority.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a danger that if we apply that we
                will not have a united, pluralist and diverse society, but a
                dualist one wherein only two sections are recognised. The
                fundamental test that we will be looking for in January 2001 is
                what specific measures within the final Programme for Government
                will be applied to promote sharing and end separation.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr C Wilson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Regardless of the merits or otherwise of the
                Programme for Government presented to the Assembly today, my
                party will be neither supporting nor endorsing it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Trimble has said that this is the most
                important business ever to be discussed in this Assembly. He
                referred to it as &quot;the maturing of the Belfast
                Agreement.&quot; It may well be that. However, what we will
                witness today is an attempt to place a veneer of democracy and
                normality over something extremely undemocratic and very
                abnormal. What is abnormal — and the public are well aware of
                it, even if those in this Chamber have become slightly
                insensitive to it — is that those who have participated in
                this Programme for Government include a party that is fronting a
                terrorist organisation. As we sit here planning government, they
                are planning further acts of terrorism, restocking and
                replenishing their weaponry, planning bombing campaigns and
                targeting members of the security forces.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is also abnormal that in this very Chamber
                one of the major parties in the Executive and involved in this
                Programme for Government, namely Mr Mallon and the SDLP, is not
                prepared to give its unqualified support to the security forces
                in Northern Ireland. It will not support the RUC. Along with its
                partner Sinn Féin, it even questions whether it will ever be
                able to endorse any law enforcement group in the Province.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is another extremely abnormal thing
                about the situation we find ourselves in today. Many Members
                were elected on a mandate to oppose the Belfast Agreement. They
                stood, as I did, through the referendum campaign and during the
                election for this Assembly pledging themselves to oppose the
                outworking of the Belfast Agreement and the institutions and
                Executive set up under that agreement. When Sinn Féin Members
                took the Pledge of Office under Annex A of the Belfast
                Agreement, committing themselves to non-violence and exclusively
                peaceful and democratic means, others in the Chamber had to make
                a pledge to participate in the preparation of a Programme for
                Government. That programme is before us today, and those Members
                will have to operate within the framework of that programme when
                it has been agreed with the Executive Committee and endorsed by
                the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I make no apology for saying that my party
                will not be supporting this draft Programme for Government.
                Others have in that under the Pledge of Office they swore that
                they would see to the implementation of the programme once it
                had been agreed. The majority of the Unionist community in
                Northern Ireland is opposed to the Belfast Agreement, to the
                outworkings of the agreement and to those elected to this House
                to represent that view who are reneging on their pledges and
                promises. We in the Northern Ireland Unionist Party intend fully
                to meet our commitments. We are opposed to the Belfast
                Agreement, to terrorists in Government, and we are opposed to
                the sham that passes for democracy.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I noted that the First Minister in his

                have already created what is mentioned on page 25</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;a strategy for the devlopment of
                centres of curiosity and imagination&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not know what that entails, but we have
                already created a centre of curiosity and imagination, because
                one party has not participated in the Programme for Government.
                Another party which did participate is probably now prohibited
                from taking part in an aspect of that Programme for Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will follow the themes set out by the
                Executive, and I want to make a number of points relating to
                targets and timetables. It was unfortunate that the public
                service agreements have not arrived with the Assembly, for they
                would have contained most of the meat for the Programme for
                Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister informed us that the
                public service agreements should be with us by next month,
                although potentially in draft form only. We are not approaching
                this in a coherent way. This Programme for Government lists some
                actions and some targets but very few. Most will be in the
                public service agreements, but we do not have them, so we cannot
                compare one with the other.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are told there are 32 action points. One
                in particular tells us that by 2002 we will have some type of
                health education programme for schools. That point has been
                talked about for a number of years. Why was it not linked with
                the issue of teenage pregnancy? We do not have these programmes
                in our schools at the moment, and clearly that is an emergency.
                That is one example of where the Government have not met their
                own target of being cohesive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Executives’ programme funds,
                though like my Colleague, Mr Ford, I feel that an opportunity
                has been lost. We have heard enough about the need for a
                children’s ccmmissioner in Northern Ireland. The Deputy First
                Minister has, I understand, already signed an Early Day Motion
                in Westminster to have the remit of the children’s
                commissioner extended to Northern Ireland as it has been to
                Scotland and Wales, and when the possibility of there being a
                children’s fund was mooted, he should have followed this up.
                However, there is no mention of it under the children’s fund
                in the Programme for Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What will the distribution network be? The
                Chancellor has set up a children’s fund in Great Britain,
                although we know that the distribution network there was not to
                be used to subsidise statutory programmes but to create new
                funding for those who work with children. We should do likewise
                here, but the Programme for Government does not state that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The welfare-to-work programme has one of the
                largest budgets. If we bring in those funds, we will have the
                flexibility that should go with devolved expenditure. At the
                moment, we are greatly restricted in how we spend funding from
                the New Deal programme. Since Northern Ireland has the highest
                unemployment, I would have liked to see that in the Programme
                for Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have raised the private finance initiative
                over and over again. We are to decide whether this is strategic
                and practicable by 2002. I am tied up in planning appeals at the
                moment because the private finance initiative has had such a
                disastrous impact in a community in which I have lived. It has
                been decided to build a school under the private finance
                initiative, and all the hockey pitches have been sold off. The
                Department of Education has said that the pitches were surplus
                to needs. However, at the inquiry, the Department of the
                Environment said that that should never have been done. Is that
                cohesion? It certainly is not. In the Programme for Government,
                I would have liked to see a reference to Departments’ talking
                to one another about what they are going to do about open space.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to point out something about
                justice, equality and inclusion. In the Northern Ireland Civil
                Service review, only three women were appointed to senior
                positions. If any new review is to take place, it should have an
                affirmative action programme to take account of that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The lack of consultation worries me greatly.
                The Assembly Committees are mentioned once in the entire
                document, as is the Civic Forum. If the Assembly Committees have
                powers for policy development, consultation and scrutiny, why
                was so little reference made to their important work in the
                Programme for Government?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, the issues in the appendix were the
                most useful, because there we have actual performance
                indicators. They should be integrated into the Programme for
                Government, not annexed.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order. The Member’s time is up.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCartney:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has been said that a house that is built
                upon sand cannot stand. This is a Programme for Government, but
                it is a programme by a Government whose sustainability is by no
                means certain. We are masking the real questions by talking
                about social and economic matters. These are very important, but
                it is rather like talking about the social and economic welfare
                of the inhabitants of a house which is in imminent danger of
                collapsing around their ears.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Adams raised a fundamental point when he
                said that the First Minister and his party were exercising some
                sort of veto over the progress of government. To some extent
                that is true, but why is it true? It is true because while this
                is a unique form of government, it is not a unique form of
                government in the process of evolution. It is in fact a form of
                government which, like the mule, has no pride of ancestry and,
                if the pan-Nationalist front has its way, has no hope of
                posterity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nationalists, and particularly Sinn Féin,
                have made it clear that they see this Government, which is to
                deliver the programme, as nothing more than a transitional
                mechanism to enable them to obtain their final objective of a
                united Ireland. If one looks at the fundamentals of the
                Government which is to deliver this programme, that fact is
                self-evident.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have here a unique form of government —
                some might describe it as a political Caliban — and what does
                it do? It creates the very differences which Mr Adams has
                underlined. In a normal democracy, a Government which achieves a
                majority then delivers its manifesto. There is collective
                responsibility within its Executive, which is chaired by the
                Leader of that Government. No such thing exists here. We have
                strange tensions given the First Minister’s obligation to his
                party and to the manifesto upon which members of his party were
                elected to this Chamber. That manifesto made reference to the
                equality agenda, the RUC, decommissioning and the representation
                in Government of representatives of a party which the Prime
                Minister has described as inextricably linked to one of the most
                sophisticated and deadly terrorist organisations in Europe,
                which is determined to remain armed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These tensions, divisions and objectives will
                inevitably prevent this Government from ever having any viable
                future, except a future as a temporary and transitional
                arrangement to achieve the objectives of those who wish
                ultimately to destroy it.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.45 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If there are any queries about this analysis,
                simply look at the construction of this Government. Under the d’Hondt
                system, there is not one but a selection of parties, each with
                its own objectives and political imperatives, and Ministers run
                their Departments as independent fiefdoms. Like Chinese
                warlords, they advance only their own interests. If this
                Executive should prove totally incompetent and have a disastrous
                period of office, and if there is another election under the d’Hondt
                principle, broadly the same parties will be re-elected in
                similar numbers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They will appoint their own Ministers from
                within their own parties. There will be no criteria by which to
                judge whether these Ministers or the policies of these parties
                have delivered good government in social, economic or
                constitutional terms. There will simply be the same again,
                because the Assembly, in its design and purpose, was never
                intended to be permanent. Its institutions do not create the
                circumstances in which permanent, practical and real evolution
                can occur. It is simply a Mexican stand-off incorporated in a
                form of government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The scant merits of this Programme for
                Government are long on aspiration, noble language and what the
                press describe as the &quot;vision thing&quot;. However, they
                are very short on elements which address the fundamental problem
                of what sort of Government there will be to deliver this
                programme.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr B Bell:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Executive’s Programme for
                Government, which provides a way for the people of Northern
                Ireland to prosper in a spirit of co-operation and mutual
                respect. At this stage, I have to admit, the programme can be
                little more than an outline for government. It provides the bare
                bones for future development, and it will need to be fleshed out
                by each Department. A positive start has been made, and this
                must be applauded.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In ‘Making a Difference’, the Executive
                commits itself to good government and to the fostering of
                debate, co-operation and government in an open, efficient and
                accountable manner. I concur with this, and I will suggest a
                base on which this pledge can be secured. As a former Belfast
                councillor and as a long-standing councillor in Lisburn, I can
                contribute to what I hope will be an ongoing debate on this
                matter. In 1972, the Parliament of Northern Ireland passed
                legislation to reform local government. The present system of 26
                councils came into operation in 1973 and has remained virtually
                intact ever since.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Councils have obtained extra powers in areas
                such as tourism and economic development. However, while the
                system is meant to be complementary to this regional Parliament
                at Stormont, it has, in effect, operated in the vacuum of direct
                rule. As a result, councillors have had the semblance of power
                without the substance. Too often, they are the scapegoats in a
                system over which they have little control. For example, when
                dealing with planning issues, a contentious matter in Northern
                Ireland, councillors must be careful not to overstep the mark
                between consultation and decision-making. They also have to be
                careful not to give the impression that they have influence
                where they have none.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In cases of road problems, constituents often
                blame councils rather than the Roads Service, which has the
                ultimate power. Decision-making systems must be examined in
                their entirety. The number of quangos has risen over the years
                with the result that virtually all areas of public life are
                populated by those described as &quot;the great and the
                good&quot;, few of whom have ever presented themselves to the
                electorate. I have represented my council on various bodies. At
                least I can claim some democratic credentials for doing so. At
                one time there was council representation on health boards, but
                the previous Government removed these elected representatives.
                Now the virtually toothless health councils are all that is left
                for councils to deal with.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not attacking the quality of work that
                has been carried out by quangos — far from it. Many members
                give up valuable time to public service, but public
                accountability must be a priority, and the whole area of local
                government, boards, trusts and the other bodies must be
                examined. Members may agree when I contend that 26 councils are
                excessive for an area of the size of Northern Ireland — by the
                same token, the number of councillors must also be considered if
                the local government system is scaled down.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should also examine the optimum number of
                health and education boards and consider whether 19 health
                trusts provide too much duplication for a population of 1·6
                million. Can we economise?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the area of economic development, the
                operation of both the IDB and LEDU must lead to overlaps and
                confusion. We should consider establishing a single body to seek
                out and maintain jobs and to work in close conjunction with
                relevant Ministers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am a member of the National Association of
                Councillors. Every party in this room is represented there; they
                all agree that there should be a review, and I too support that
                aim.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr A Doherty:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are a small part of a small island. Our
                island is a small part of a small island group. To our left is a
                huge mass of water stretching from continent to continent and
                from pole to pole. To our right is a huge land mass; two
                continents reaching half way across the world. In global terms
                we are very small, but we are not insignificant. Our horizons
                are as wide as anyone else’s. Our skies are as high and reach
                as far. So while we are small we must not think small: we must
                think big; we must think globally.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is one reason for the Programme for
                Government’s being so important. That is why those who say
                that the programme should concentrate on our internal affairs
                are so wrong. They want to have as little as possible to do with
                our neighbours on this island, in Europe and the world. It is
                not enough for us simply to put our house in order.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have all seen the distressing pictures of
                hundreds of proud home owners who have put their lovely houses
                in perfect order only to see them destroyed by nature out of
                control. Anything that might have been done to prevent or
                minimise flooding would have involved forethought and action,
                not just at local or national level, but even on an
                international scale.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is right then that the Programme for
                Government should take account of the need for north, south,
                east, west and international co-operation at many levels, not
                least with regard to environmental and sustainable development
                issues. Our seas and many of our waterways and beaches are
                polluted. Our fish stocks are dwindling. Animal disease and
                genetic modification of crops pose serious threats to public
                health as well as adding to the grave difficulties facing our
                farmers. The rich diversity of our animal and plant life is
                under continuous threat from dodgy development plans, from dodgy
                agricultural and gardening practices and from littering,
                ignorance and vandalism. We pump millions of tonnes of chemical
                pollutants into the air from our cars and vans or lorries and
                buses, from our mopeds, from coal fires and central heating and
                from our factories and power stations — even our cows and our
                sheep are guilty of gaseous pollution. When meteorological
                turmoil occurs in our atmosphere we do not know what to do,
                since our brains have been cooked by mobile phones and
                high-tension power lines.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And there is more: we create piles of waste,
                mountains of waste, Himalayas of waste. Irresponsible people tip
                waste over fences or bridges. Good citizens fill their wheelie
                bins to overflowing. Waste is buried in holes in the ground,
                sending clouds of methane into the atmosphere and poisonous
                leachate into our water systems. We talk about waste
                minimisation, waste reuse, recycling, energy recovery and zero
                waste. What great ideas — let us get started.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These are just a few of the issues that the
                Programme for Government must tackle. I have not touched on the
                topic of sustainable development, which is at the very heart of
                every aspect of the programme. I do not have time to discuss
                costs, but we need all the help we can get from the United
                Kingdom, from the Republic, from Europe, from wherever.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I finish by quoting from the Programme for
                Government:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;In the Agreement, unique structures
                were established within the Island of Ireland, within the United
                Kingdom, and East/West to provide a new basis for
                relationships.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must use those relationships, that new
                co-operation, to save our beautiful country for our children and
                our visitors, who are enchanted by it, and in our own small way
                do what we can to save our planet.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Shannon:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to speak on paragraph 1.9 in the
                draft Programme for Government, which covers the rural economy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There should be a real emphasis and focus on
                the farming community and also on our beleaguered fishing
                industry. Prices for finished products continue to fall; fuel
                prices continue to rise; more and more farmers and fishermen
                have gone to the wall; and their jobs are in jeopardy. Recent
                statistics have shown that the number of suicides in the farming
                community is rising. These figures are very worrying and
                represent a catalogue of misery, broken families and despair.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the Programme for Government there has
                been an increase in the budget for agriculture and rural
                development, but where is the money going? Is it going towards
                administration, or is it going to the farming sector? The budget
                allocation for the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy
                First Minister constitutes some £29 million, while the figure
                to run the Assembly is £39 million. Has lottery fever struck
                the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister?
                How can they justify those costs given the costs for the
                Assembly? Perhaps they see this as their roll-over year. Some of
                that funding would be better allocated to the agriculture and
                fishing sectors. It would be better spent, more appreciated and
                much more productive. We know that the farming sector is the
                largest employer in Northern Ireland, making up some 10% of the
                workforce. We also know how much is owed to the banks and about
                falling incomes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the rural economy section, the Programme
                for Government could have addressed the desperate need for
                childcare facilities, which are scarce in rural areas. Even if
                they do exist, the cost is prohibitive, as many farmers and
                their workers earn the equivalent of part- time wages.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are structural changes to the
                agriculture budget, which means less money for farming families.
                However, the increase in rural development money should be
                targeted towards farming families.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.00</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">More and more people are moving to the
                countryside — people who do not depend on farming for their
                livelihood or to survive, but we need to focus on farming
                families. The slow but steady downturn in profitability has
                resulted in full-time farmers being on part-time wages and
                seeking alternative employment. How will the Programme for
                Government help with retraining, and how will help be made
                available to the farming sector directly? Can the Minister
                indicate what proportion of the Department of Agriculture and
                Rural Development’s budget of £191&nbsp;million will go
                straight to the farmers instead of to administration? Does
                anyone feel that the Programme for Government will deliver a
                viable future for farmers? Many farmers do not agree, and their
                futures are bleak.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Paragraph 1.8 refers to a better environment.
                How will the environmental scheme work? It is already
                underfunded, so what tangible benefits does the Minister see
                coming from it if it is not funded adequately? If this remains
                the case, it will fall at the first fence.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Paragraph 1.9 refers to the creation of new
                skills and new job opportunities. While there is a great
                opportunity for job creation in the agri-food industry, further
                processing offers no such possibilities. Vegetables, beef, lamb
                or fish cannot be processed, for the money and assistance are
                currently not available. Potential processors will have to wait
                until next year or the year after before their applications can
                be processed. There is a plethora of golden job opportunities
                that could create prosperity and breathe life into the rural
                community. A vibrant agriculture industry is possible, but a
                vision is needed from within the Department of Agriculture and
                Rural Development. Is there that vision and the commitment to
                realise it? If the programme does not focus on the farming
                families and the job opportunities within further processing, it
                will have failed miserably.</p>

                issues relating to particular Departments. Almost all the
                Ministers will respond at some stage, but when a Member raises
                points of detail — for example, as Mr Shannon has done on
                agriculture — it is not reasonable to expect the Minister
                responding at the end of this particular section to cover that.
                He will have substantial difficulties covering all the matters
                that have been raised in any case. The Minister of Agriculture
                should be speaking later in the day and may be able to respond,
                as may other Ministers. This does not apply only to Mr Shannon
                but to a number of Members. The various Ministers will speak at
                different times. If a Minister has spoken and a Member raises a

                will be able to respond to that only in writing. If the matter

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. The
                Finance and Personnel Committee discussed the Programme for
                Government but could not agree on how to respond. All parties
                will want to respond, and we will do so today. I want to touch
                on some of the issues that came up in the Committee. I welcome
                the opportunity for this discussion of the so-called Programme
                for Government, and I hope that partnership, equality and
                accountability will become a reality.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is a pity that the discussion did not take
                place before the document was published. The cloud of secrecy
                which hung over the Executive discussions does not auger well
                for inclusivity. Can this be a Programme for Government when we
                are not a Government, when we do not control our finances and
                when we are dependent on the British Exchequer for resources and
                for the workings of the Barnett formula? However, I welcome the
                statement that the Executive will press for a fair allocation of
                resources. The other sort of finance is the regional rate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let me deal with the Barnett formula. It is
                flawed, and, as stated in the Programme for Government, it does
                not address our needs. It cannot address our needs, because
                Barnett does not target need; it is a headcount that regulates
                the difference between areas. What has been done so far to press
                for a fair allocation? What has been the British Government’s
                response? What is proposed for the future to ensure that we get
                a fair allocation? What was the percentage rise allocated under
                the Barnett formula from the block grant? The Barnett formula
                discriminates quite clearly against the North. Less is allocated
                for health here than is allocated in England, Scotland or Wales.
                Less is spent on education here, and particularly on school
                buildings. Approximately one third of what is spent on sport and
                leisure facilities in England is spent here. We are clearly not
                being given a fair or equal share of the allocation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Barnett does not target need, but we must
                target need if the Programme for Government is to mean anything
                for the people we represent. In the Programme for Government and
                the Budget, the Executive have gone for the easy option — to
                add 8% to the rates. We were told that the Assembly would not
                have tax-raising powers, but it has increased the regional rate
                for domestic property by 8% and by 6·6% for non-domestic
                property such as small shops and businesses, which are already
                suffering. These increases are based on a valuation made five
                years ago, and they certainly do not represent an easy option
                for those people involved.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If it is a tax, then we should call it a tax.
                If the regional rate is to finance the Budget and the Programme
                for Government, we should call it the Assembly Tax and collect
                it as such. Any rise should be in line with inflation —
                approximately 3%. Where did the figure of 8% come from? Is there
                a balance sheet to show that 8% is needed to match up with what
                is already allocated under the block grant? The rates are a very
                unfair method of taxation. Those who do not have access to
                services — hospitals, roads and infrastructure — pay the
                same as those who do.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The rates hit all households but not
                individuals. The issue will further divide families and create
                problems with housing benefit, et cetera. Those living west of
                the Bann will pay the same as those living in other areas and
                those who have services such as hospitals, schools and
                infrastructure. The M1 stops at Dungannon, and the M2 stops
                beyond Antrim. The 6% rise for shops, offices and businesses
                takes no account of the suffering of town centres over recent
                years from the effects of out-of-town developments. It is based
                on a valuation made five years ago, and it is an unfair system
                of taxation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We rightly criticised NIE last week for a 9%
                rise in electricity charges. We criticised the fuel rise, yet
                now we are saying that there must be an 8% rise on rates. The
                Assembly should reject this rise in rates, just as we said that
                the electricity charge increase announced last week was
                unacceptable.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the Programme for Government is to mean
                anything to people, it must redress the imbalances of the past.
                It must redress the 80 years of neglect west of the Bann and
                reverse the discrimination of the past. What other sources of
                finance were sought? Were the British Government asked to use
                the war chest and the peace dividend to redress the imbalance?
                Was the issue of the Celtic tiger addressed with the Irish
                Government? When are the Irish Government going to ensure that
                the Celtic tiger covers the 32 counties of Ireland? As far as
                European funding is concerned, will there be matching funding
                available and will additionality be ensured? The Civil Service

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Hanna:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the opportunity to speak about the
                Programme for Government. I want to focus on the environmental
                aspects and, more specifically, on sustainability, which has
                been referred to several times today and which is referred to
                several times in the Programme for Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sustainable development is development that
                meets the needs of current generations without compromising the
                capability of future generations to meet their needs. We should
                all strive to achieve this goal, and it is much more than an
                environmental agenda. We must consider the long-term
                implications of our decisions and give equal weight to the
                environmental, social and economic dimensions of development.
                That aspiration should become a reality. Sustainability must be
                a key theme of the whole Programme for Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There should be clear recognition of the
                importance of protecting our built heritage. This important
                element is a cornerstone of sustainability. I refer to
                chapter&nbsp;2 on the tackling of poverty and renewal of
                disadvantaged neighbourhoods. The preservation of our heritage
                is not just about the aesthetic. It is also about needs,
                especially the need for safe and healthy housing and a healthy
                environment. If we can meet these needs through the restoration
                of historic buildings and the rehabilitation of existing
                buildings, we will have a more sustainable and attractive
                environment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should encourage the flexible take-up of
                improvement and repair grants. We should encourage urban
                regeneration through rehabilitation rather than redevelopment.
                To avoid disposal, we should train more plumbers, electricians,
                joiners and other tradesmen. We should encourage a sense of
                pride and the restoration of historic buildings by promoting an
                awareness of local history. The attractiveness of our country to
                visitors, tourists or workers, depends on the retention and
                promotion of our heritage as well as clean air, clean water and
                good infrastructure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should promote the concept of third-party
                planning appeals. That would increase the power of people to
                influence decisions on their local environment. The elimination
                of the planning backlog should not be achieved at the expense of
                sound planning decisions. We must encourage general
                environmental awareness.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to chapter 3 of the programme,
                ‘Working for a Healthier People’, we could reduce air
                pollution by encouraging greater use of public transport and
                ensuring fast and regular bus and train services. We should also
                develop more pedestrian and cycle routes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If such points were addressed, we would truly
                see sustainability in action. I am glad to have an opportunity
                to focus on sustainability. It is a live environmental issue
                that connects the generations, giving us all a greater sense of
                ourselves and our environment. Despite our political
                differences, every Member of this House wants to protect and
                cherish our environment.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Poots:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to address section 1.3 of the
                Programme, ‘A Cohesive, Inclusive and Just Society’. It
                discusses the new targeting social need policy. We should
                consider that policy: members of the public often refer to it as
                &quot;targeting sectarian need&quot;. We must ensure that the
                targeting social need programme reaches across the entire
                community and does not reach only to specific areas of the
                community. We should recognise that there are severe problems in
                many Unionist as well as Nationalist parts of the community. We
                should look in particular at the Shankill Road. The terms of the
                new targeting social need policy, especially in relation to
                long-term unemployment, would rule parts of that area out.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to see the appointment of a
                children’s commissioner. Many children are living in abject
                poverty, and many are brought up in situations that many of us
                could not comprehend. It is sad that children are brought up in
                such circumstances.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Chapter 2 refers to the employment of Roman
                Catholics in the senior Civil Service. I have no objections to
                the Executive’s examining that issue, but it should look at
                the entire Civil Service. In the lower ranks, the Protestant
                community is under-represented. In a few years’ time, we will
                have the same problem with the senior Civil Service, as
                Protestant civil servants will not have come up through the
                ranks. Therefore, there should be an examination of the Civil
                Service as a whole, as opposed to its senior ranks alone.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Chapter 6 of the programme sets out the
                aspirations of the Executive regarding relations with north
                America and Europe. I do not think that the funds that have been
                set aside make those aspirations feasible. As regards Northern
                Ireland’s international image, the document talks about the
                development of</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of our cultural treasures is the
                celebration of the Twelfth of July. It is enjoyed by hundreds of
                thousands of people every year and is one of the most colourful
                events in the Province. The Government should examine the
                promotion of the Twelfth of July as a tourist attraction, with a
                view to undermining those who seek to destroy what is good in
                the Province.</p>

                monitoring development and progress towards electronic service
                delivery. Once again, what is set out in the Programme for
                Government fails to match up with what is in the Budget. An
                application for £15·9 million was not successful. No money has
                been allocated for electronic government, and there will clearly
                be problems in meeting the targets set unless the finance is
                made available.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will we be introducing our own freedom-of-
                information legislation, or is it the Executive’s intention to
                adopt the Westminster legislation for a period, afterwards
                seeking to amend it?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I should like to see a clear definition of
                Executive and Northern Ireland Office responsibilities on the
                issue of victims. On too many occasions Members of this House,
                and victims themselves, have sought answers, only to be sent
                from one Department to another. We need clear definitions of the
                responsibilities of each Department. The issue of
                capacity-building, to which the document refers, must be looked
                at, for it has been used as a means of discriminating against
                certain victims’ groups that do not happen to be in favour
                with the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First
                Minister.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those are only a few of the issues I wish to
                tackle. I welcome the proposal to introduce free public
                transport for senior citizens.</p>

                David Trimble opened his speech this morning by saying his
                objective was a new beginning. He listed Protestants, Catholics,
                Unionists, Republicans, Nationalists and Loyalists and other
                groups in society, saying that they were what the draft
                Programme for Government was about.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I should have liked to talk in particular
                about chapter 7 and the partnerships involved between the
                institutions — all the institutions — in the community,
                including the Assembly. Community leaders are an essential part
                of this and must be equal partners in moving the process
                forward. I should have liked to discuss devising ways of dealing
                directly with the community sector, methods and mechanisms for
                going into the community. Some of that is already happening.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a member of the Social Development
                Committee, I should also have liked to talk about the
                substantial shortfall in the budget for that Department. A
                substantial portion of the blame for that shortfall lies with
                the two successive DUP Ministers who failed to go to the
                Executive and argue vociferously for the Department.</p>

                members of the Ulster Unionist Council detailing the proposals
                put to it on 28 October. Both of these were penned by the First
                Minister, and therein lies the great difficulty. The first might
                be described as a statement of intent to collapse the Executive
                on the part of the First Minister, while the second details a
                method of collapse. In the first, he argues that Mr Jeffrey
                Donaldson’s proposal was an exit strategy without a re-entry
                strategy. I shall quote one short section:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The response is intended to increase
                pressure progressively on Republicans and Nationalists. This
                might result in a crisis for the Assembly and Executive. But if
                that arises we must do all that we can to put responsibility on
                republicans.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is about crisis and suspension and
                putting the blame on Republicans. We must remember that all
                these institutions are entwined, so that if one falls, they all
                fall. In his own proposal, after saying that he will not
                nominate Sinn Féin Ministers for North/South Ministerial
                Council meetings, the First Minister goes on to put demands on
                almost every other party to the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He demands that the Independent International
                Commission on Decommissioning (IICD) be proactive in fulfilling
                its mandate; he demands monthly reports, sets deadlines and
                prescribes timetables. He warns that if either of the two
                Governments, or any other party, interferes with this, he will
                progressively terminate meetings of the North/South Ministerial
                Council and the British- Irish Council. He then demands that the
                Government convene a formal review and put a moratorium on
                policing. After setting us all these tasks he is going to set up
                another Ulster Unionist Party meeting in January to decide
                whether we have all performed well. Somewhere he has said that
                he has had twenty-one meetings of the Ulster Unionist Council.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I read the draft Programme for Government. I
                have criticisms of its being aspirational — many people have
                spoke of its being definitively too aspirational — and
                sustainability is a recurring problem. There is a substantial
                difference between the programme and the Budget, which is to be
                discussed tomorrow. This whole debate is aspirational: the
                sustainability of the Assembly and the other institutions is
                under scrutiny, because David Trimble is involved in their
                collapse. That is what we need to rectify and what David Trimble
                needs to rectify.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Finance and Personnel (Mr
                Durkan): </b>Given the number of points raised and the fact that
                I have only five minutes in which to speak, I am not going<b> </b>to
                be able to cover everything. Several issues recurred in Members’
                comments, and I want to deal with<b> 
                </b>
 some of them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, we had criticisms that this is too
                aspirational, too visionary. Others seemed to imply that there
                was not enough vision, that the document was too prosaic. The
                fact is that in embarking on this Programme for Government, the
                Executive has tried to come up with the right balance between a
                clear vision — where we want to take this society under these
                new institutions — and a real sense of mission, in other words
                how we will use the responsibilities and resources that fall to
                us as a regional Administration. Clearly our resources are not
                as we would want them to be, and, in many cases, our
                responsibilities are not as complete as we would want them to
                be. Nevertheless, we have to meet those responsibilities and
                manage resources. That is what we have tried to do, in a planned
                way, in the proposals we have brought forward in the Programme
                for Government and the draft Budget as well.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The whole Executive Committee agreed this
                Programme for Government. They also agreed that the draft Budget
                for the next financial year was consistent with it and would
                help to enable the aims of the programme to be discharged. This
                is a draft Programme for Government, and tomorrow we will be
                discussing a draft Budget. This programme is a multiannual
                prospectus; the Budget proposals that have been tabled to date
                relate only to the next financial year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some Members indicated that they would have
                preferred more detail about public service agreements, et
                cetera. More detail would be welcome, and it will be
                forthcoming. However, if the Executive had waited until it had
                the detailed public service agreements worked out for every
                Department, for every area of spend, and had then presented a
                draft programme in those terms, people would have said &quot;No,
                you should have presented a more general draft. We would then
                have decided on the priorities and principles from which the
                public service agreements should flow.&quot; Members cannot have
                it both ways — wanting us to consult and then criticising us
                because we have produced a document that is clearly for
                consultation. This is here for further elaboration, for further
                work and for development. The Assembly will have the detailed
                public service agreements in a consolidated Programme for
                Government in January, to be decided in February.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly and its Committees have the
                opportunity to follow through on many important detailed points
                that concern Members today. Points were raised in relation to
                several areas. Environment seemed to get most attention in this
                session as regards sustainable development and how we understand
                that concept. Consistent with the Programme for Government, the
                Minister of the Environment, Mr Foster, will bring forward more
                details to ensure that sustainable development receives the sort
                of comprehensive, joined-up approach required, as it affects all
                aspects of public policy and public management.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members have asked for detail on certain
                points. The Departments will provide that detail as they
                develop, in consultation with the relevant departmental
                Committees, the detailed actions and targets necessary to bring
                forward informed and articulate public service agreements. Those
                points will be brought forward in due time, whether they relate
                to housing, education or water and sewerage.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It would have been impossible for us to have
                a Programme for Government that details every single item
                currently being undertaken, because people would say it was
                simply an inventory of all current activities and, therefore,
                would lack the sort of vision that people here have rightly been
                asking for.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In this Programme for Government we have
                tried to set out an agenda for change and improvement across the
                range of Government Departments. The programme emphasises many
                new activities and new actions, and to that extent, it
                understates a huge volume of work that has already been
                undertaken by Departments.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We now move to the second section, beginning
                with chapters 2 and 3 of the Programme for Government.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure (Mr
                McGimpsey):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the First Minister explained at the
                opening of this debate, the Executive Committee agreed that two
                of the key challenges we face are the need to build a cohesive,
                creative, inclusive and just society and the need to improve the
                health of the population. These major issues require all the
                Departments to work together, and we hope the following session
                will provide an opportunity for a full debate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, I want to focus on the theme we
                explore in our priority area: growing as a community. We can
                create confidence in our different communities only if we are
                confident in our rights and responsibilities. We can achieve it
                only if we can create security from poverty for individuals and
                security from disadvantage for communities. That confidence is
                essential if we are to tackle the real divisions in our society
                and tap into our latent creativity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our approach, therefore, will not only focus
                on promoting equality in human rights. We will link that to
                tackling poverty and social disadvantage, the renewal of
                disadvantaged neighbourhoods and the sustaining of local
                communities and their organisations. We will marry this to
                improving community relations and the breaking down of the deep
                divisions in society. The danger is that we can easily produce
                fine-sounding rhetoric, but these are extremely stubborn
                problems, and we have to be realistic about what can be achieved
                and the timescale in which that will be done.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nevertheless, we are a new devolved
                Administration. We are the locally elected representatives of
                the people, and we know what the problems are. We appreciate
                that people are our only natural resource. We know what
                different groups need, and we know what can be done.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Moving on to the details of the priority, our
                first focus is on ensuring the effective promotion of equality
                in human rights. Key to this will be the development of a number
                of important cross-cutting approaches such as developing and
                implementing new policies on gender and inequalities. By April
                2001, we will consult on a single equality Bill to be introduced
                in 2002, and by the end of 2002, we will complete an evaluation
                of the targeting social need policy, enabling us to see how this
                works.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We will tackle the major issues of
                participation and accessibility. We will also address the needs
                of the disabled and assure equality of treatment for all.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.30 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The victims of past violence are very
                important. We are all agreed that their needs must get special
                attention. Our aim, in meeting victims’ needs, is to help
                healing and assist individuals affected to gain confidence. By
                April 2001, we will have put in place a cross-departmental
                strategy to ensure that the needs of victims are met by the
                different services that we provide.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to talk about the socially excluded
                and those facing poverty, particularly children who are blighted
                by its impact. We will use instruments such as the ONE
                initiative, involving the Department for Social Development, the
                Department of Higher and Further Education, Training and
                Employment and other Government agencies, to provide joined-up
                welfare and employment services to help families re-enter the
                labour market.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive will bring forward proposals to
                introduce free travel on public transport for older people. We
                will also help households suffering from fuel poverty by
                introducing a new energy efficiency scheme.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Social housing is also an important matter.
                Present housing policy will be developed and will ensure that
                existing housing is adapted in the best way to suit those with
                special needs, such as the disabled. Problems of disadvantage
                and social exclusion are often found in distinct geographic
                pockets in our community. We will therefore work, not only on
                neighbourhood regeneration task groups, but also in rural
                districts where we will seek to use rural development activity
                to focus on particular areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We want to enhance local communities by
                strengthening areas where community infrastructure is weak and
                by encouraging people to take an active role in their
                neighbourhood’s regeneration. This will include areas such as
                arts, culture and libraries, sports activities and housing,
                which can all play a vital role in helping to instil confidence
                throughout our society as well as enhancing community relations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A related issue must be the celebration of
                cultural and linguistic diversity. The Department of Culture,
                Arts and Leisure will play a major role in this. My Department
                will ensure that all communities can feel confident in their own
                culture and language. We can benefit from and take pride in the
                richness of our diversity, rather than see it as a problem. In
                so doing, we can promote a positive image of Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A second priority area is ‘Working for a
                Healthier People’. During this session, we have linked this
                priority to that of ‘Growing as a Community’, because there
                are natural links. Deprivation and poverty have led to
                inequalities in the health of our population. Indeed, our health
                record compares unfavourably to that in many European regions.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order. I have to intervene. The Minister’s
                time is up.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Armstrong:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the
                draft Programme for Government and specifically, to voice my
                views on ‘Working for a Healthier People’ from the rural
                perspective. Our rural community has been facing severe hardship
                in recent times, and there is a need to look to the future, form
                new strategies and plan a better tomorrow.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, I welcome the realisation, as outlined
                in section 1.9 of the draft programme, that rural areas are
                important and that it is necessary to develop new skills and
                jobs. Our rural community must be considered in every aspect of
                future plans for Northern Ireland. Farmers and those living in
                rural areas must be sustained. The farming community is the
                backbone of the rural community. They are the custodians of the
                countryside, the environment, and a substantial part of our
                culture and heritage.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rural areas make up a large proportion of
                Northern Ireland, and this must be taken into account. Northern
                Ireland has a surface area of 1·4 million hectares, which is
                approximately 3·5 million acres, and a population of 1·6
                million. Rural districts account for 95% of Northern Ireland,
                and 700,000 people live in those areas — that is 43·6% of the
                total population. Over 359,000 people living in rural areas —
                that is over 50% — are classified as disadvantaged.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, section 2.4.2 of the programme
                states that the Government will &quot;sustain and enhance local
                communities&quot;. I urge that the programme take into
                consideration the needs of farmers and those living in rural
                communities and, in particular, outline specific objectives to
                provide support in these times of great hardship.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thirdly, under the heading ‘Working for a
                Healthier People’, I welcome the recognition that</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Everyone has the right to timely,
                quality care based on clinical and social need.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the programme should pay particular
                attention to those living in rural communities, the vast
                majority of whom should have equal priority and the same
                hospital services as received by people in urban areas. There
                should be adequate acute service provision in all areas of
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I note that under section 4.3, all young
                people are to have the qualifications and skills needed to gain
                employment in a modern economy by March 2002. The proportion of
                the workforce in agriculture who hold vocational qualifications
                at NVQ level 3 or higher is to be increased to 9%. I also
                welcome section&nbsp;4.4, which outlines the aim to</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;provide lifelong learning opportunities
                to enable people to update their knowledge, skills and
                qualifications.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This aim is equally applicable to rural
                communities since the agriculture industry is deteriorating and
                there is an increasing need to find alternative employment.
                These farmers must be supported as they look for new ideas and
                employment in different areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am pleased to note in section&nbsp;5.1.3
                the reference to the difficulties faced in rural areas as a
                result of falling incomes. What better way to modernise farming
                than to have a farm regeneration scheme to encourage onto our
                farms young people who are well trained in modern farming
                methods and skilled in business management? The Programme for
                Government should make a commitment to do just that. This is a
                clear vision of the future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In conclusion, I welcome the recognition of
                the need to work together across Departments and agencies to
                tackle the fundamental problems of our society. In the same way,
                farmers must be remembered when examining all aspects of
                government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It must be remembered that the future of the
                agriculture and the agri-food sectors has a direct relationship
                to the well-being of the rural economy. We must ensure that
                there is a high-quality environment with good-quality water and
                air. We must produce food in natural surroundings to create a
                healthier way of life, thus allowing us to market ourselves
                abroad as a centre of tourism and investment. Agriculture is the
                backbone of Northern Ireland, which promotes health and social
                development for our children.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairman of the Culture, Arts and Leisure
                Committee (Mr ONeill):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, on behalf of the Culture, Arts and
                Leisure Committee, which has discussed the Programme for
                Government, I welcome the document and congratulate the
                Executive on what is a very detailed and constructive report. I
                particularly welcome the innovative approach of the Executive’s
                programme funds to assist the development of activities across
                Departments, particularly in relation to equality and targeting
                social need. We welcome the inclusion in the document of
                structured actions and actual dates for specific purposes and
                the fact that public service agreements are to be established
                with Departments to link achievement with agreed outcomes for
                public funding.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, it is not clear if the programme
                funds have been set up in response to the underfunding of these
                policy areas in Northern Ireland and if, as a result, they will
                address issues of underfunding rather than be completely new
                departures. We hope to see more clarity on that issue in the
                report.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are many references to joined-up
                Government, but there are no details of how, in practice,
                Departments will work towards mutual goals. These goals have
                been established on a short-term basis, for example, one to two
                years. The Committee believes that long-term objectives should
                also be looked at. We are concerned that the proposed date for
                completion of the strategy for the development of centres of
                curiosity and imagination is April 2002. Perhaps a scarcity
                exists, but it is a lengthy period of time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report has to be aspirational, but there
                are times when the aspiration becomes so great as to lose
                contact with reality. Speaking as an Assembly Member and not as
                Chairman of the Culture, Arts and Leisure Committee, I am
                concerned that the Programme for Government could become so
                aspirational as to lose touch with reality and leave Members in
                some difficulty. I refer particularly to something that was
                raised with the Minister for Social Development at the Social
                Development Committee last week. It is one example, though there
                are others. Paragraph 7.6 of the programme states</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;In each of the years 2000/01, 2001/02,
                and 2002/03, we will reduce levels of Social Security fraud and
                error in Income Support, Job Seekers’ Allowance, Disability
                Living Allowance and Invalid Care Allowance by 5%&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is a worthy aim, but there is no
                indication of how it can be realised. What do the Executive want
                the Assembly to support? If draconian measures were introduced
                to achieve those aims, many Members would raise their eyebrows
                in alarm and warning. There should be greater clarity about what
                is meant by assertions in the programme that are too
                aspirational.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am also concerned that the provision of
                rural housing is not identified as an aim in the Programme for
                Government. As the Deputy Speaker can attest, it was a long and
                hard struggle to get rural housing on the agenda. Some of the
                other aims in the report may be seen as making reference to
                problems with rural housing, but I am concerned that the issue
                has lost its prominence. Will the Executive look at the issue
                again and consider whether there is not a need for it to be seen
                as a separate and important issue? Mr Gallagher spoke about the
                problems with grants, particularly for houses in Fermanagh that
                are unfit for habitation. Although Fermanagh is the
                worst-affected local government area, the problem concerns
                everyone who lives in a rural area. There is a great need for
                further work on that issue. I am concerned that it is not
                included in the report. The Executive should do something about
                it.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members from all parts of the House have
                commented, rightly, on how aspirational the Programme for
                Government is and on how much of it deals with spin rather than
                substance. It is short on concrete actions and long on
                aspiration. It contains very little that is new. Much of it is a
                drawing together of proposals from various Departments that were
                already in the public domain. The parts of the programme that
                deal with how we tackle poverty and social disadvantage had
                already been laid before the Social Development Committee in
                July. Therefore there is nothing innovative in the document.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Sir John Gorman] in the
                Chair)</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This morning, the First Minister lamented
                that there had been so little public comment and debate on the
                document, but I note, with interest, the comments made by the
                business community on the day after its publication. The
                business community was of the opinion that the plethora of
                aspirational statements in the document needed to be firmed up.
                That is the reaction of the business community — hardly
                inspiring.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister and the Deputy First
                Minister have tried to inject some enthusiasm and energy into
                the matter, but that cannot be done because of the way in which
                the document is framed. We have heard that this is a wonderful
                milestone in the life of the Assembly and that, among other
                things, we have people working together in joined-up Government.
                Then, one of the parties that is supposed to be in the
                Government attacked the First Minister.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have heard reports that the Health
                Minister refused to go the joint ministerial council, that the
                First Minister banned another party from going to North/South
                meetings, that legal action has been threatened and that there
                have been rows. That is a wonderful example of joined-up
                Government and a wonderful example of how the new Executive
                works harmoniously together, or so we were told when the
                document was launched a few weeks ago.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.45 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the document’s launch Mr&nbsp;Mallon
                said that it would be business as usual for the future. He was
                proved wrong within a week. Mr&nbsp;Trimble had not even
                bothered to tell him of his plans. We have the sort of joined-up
                Government where the First&nbsp;Minister does not even tell the
                Deputy First Minister, never mind the other parties on the
                Executive, what he plans to do.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nothing in the document deals with the core
                problem that at the heart of the Government, and corrupting that
                Government, we have parties that hold on to terrorist arms and
                ammunition. Sinn&nbsp;Féin has indicated that it is not going
                to give up any arms or ammunition. That is the central issue
                that needs to be addressed. The document is full of the
                North/South, all-Ireland, dimension, and that was raised at the
                time. We pointed out that expenditure on the North/South bodies
                is about £17&nbsp;million and not £11&nbsp;million, as the
                First Minister said. He will have to apologise once again for
                misleading the House, and I hope that he will take the
                opportunity to do that as quickly as possible. That money could
                be better spent. For every £1&nbsp;million spent on
                implementing the all-Ireland dimension of the agreement, we
                could have 200&nbsp;more heart operations, we could adapt 1,000
                more homes for the disabled, and so on.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When we deal with the Budget tomorrow we will
                go into that in more detail. While there is a reference to the
                review of public administration in Northern&nbsp;Ireland, no
                Minister has yet given details of the review, what it will mean
                and how long it will take. We have heard statements outside the
                House, but the Minister has refused to come to the House to tell
                us what is happening. I would like to address more issues, but
                that will not be possible in the time that is available. One
                Member attacked the DUP for its stance on the agreement. I find
                it very sad to hear a Member such as Mr&nbsp;C&nbsp;Wilson, who
                is supposed to be in the anti-agreement camp, doing all he can
                to assist Mr&nbsp;Trimble and the Ulster Unionist Party. I
                sometimes wonder who puts him up to it and why he continues to
                attack those of us who have the people’s support on our
                anti-agreement stance.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I congratulate the Minister for Social
                Development on many of the issues that have been included in the
                Programme for Government, and I look forward to the introduction
                of free travel on public transport for older people. I hope that
                that will be implemented as quickly as possible in keeping with
                DUP manifesto commitments.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Gildernew:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A LeasCheann Comhairle, I welcome our first
                attempt at a Programme for Government. Given that this is the
                first time in generations that locally elected representatives
                have had an opportunity to make an impact on the day-to-day
                running of the Six Counties and that the past few years have
                been a steep learning curve for all, it is not surprising that
                this document is not without fault. As Deputy Chairperson of the
                Committee for Social Development, I will concentrate my remarks
                on chapter 2 ‘Growing as a Community’. It focuses on poverty
                and social inclusion, community regeneration and the enhancement
                of our voluntary and community sector.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Previous attempts at government have failed,
                but it is imperative for the people of this statelet and for all
                sections of the community, urban or rural, young or old,
                Catholic or Protestant, that we do not fail this time. In
                recognising the failures of the past, we must address what needs
                to be done to ensure that we do not make the same mistakes
                again. We should draw on the experiences of the international
                community, particularly Europe, and learn from other communities
                that are coming out of conflict. We must be radical, imaginative
                and decisive. We have to direct resources to the areas of
                greatest need in order to achieve measurable results, and we
                must make regeneration work. Above all, we have to ensure that
                people see tangible benefits from what we are doing and address
                issues of critical importance in a way that empowers our
                communities and eradicates poverty for good.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Therefore it is essential that this is a
                template for good effective governance. Words like
                &quot;inclusive&quot;, &quot;cohesive&quot;,
                &quot;effective&quot;, &quot;transparency&quot;,
                &quot;just&quot;, &quot;equal&quot;, &quot;accessible&quot; and
                &quot;consistent&quot; are dotted throughout this chapter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, we must guarantee that those
                sentiments are not merely aspirational but real targets for the
                next 12&nbsp;months. In order to achieve this we must ask
                ourselves some challenging questions. For example, given that we
                have had community regeneration initiatives since the 1980s, why
                are many of our towns and huge parts of our cities still run
                down and derelict? Have projects like Making Belfast Work
                delivered real and tangible benefits to all of the community, or
                are some areas attracting vast sums of money while others remain
                neglected and impoverished? Has EU funding really been
                additional, or has it systematically been used in place of
                British Exchequer funding? Money, ring-fenced for community
                projects that will prioritise tackling discrimination and
                poverty, should not be wasted or redirected into other areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must all strive to achieve the promotion
                of equality and human rights. Without our fundamental rights we
                cannot make progress on any of our policies. Therefore I am glad
                to see plans on how we do this early in the programme. If we
                achieve all of the targets set out in section&nbsp;2.2 we will
                have achieved a great deal and will have started to move away
                from the inequalities of the past.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The promotion of human rights and equality
                must be the key priority of this Assembly. Further, it is time
                for Unionism to accept that institutionalised discrimination has
                been practised here for the past 80&nbsp;years. In this
                building, the founding fathers of Ulster Unionism preached and
                practised discrimination as a tool of political manipulation and
                control. Discrimination and disadvantage did, and does, exist.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Paragraph 2.3.2. says</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;We will work to provide high quality
                affordable social housing for those on low incomes&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was disappointed to see no mention of
                tackling rural unfitness. My constituency, Fermanagh and South
                Tyrone, contains the highest levels of unfit rural housing on
                these islands, yet this has been omitted completely. In order to
                achieve what we set out to do in terms of replacement programmes
                and disabled adaptations, we are going to have to fund the
                Housing Executive adequately. I am sure every elected
                representative here has been frustrated at some point about the
                lack of resources to get things done or the speed at which work
                gets carried out. I would also agree with Gerry&nbsp;Kelly that
                if Maurice&nbsp;Morrow had fought his corner in the Executive, I
                do not believe the Housing Executive would have suffered from
                budget restraints in the way it has.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would also like to have a point clarified.

                their own communities.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Are we going to prioritise areas with the
                weakest community infrastructure or those most disadvantaged?
                These mean very different things.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How committed are we really to the community
                and voluntary sector when it has received a pittance from
                mainstream funding, when the actions in the Programme for
                Government do not include details of how this ambitious section
                is going to be achieved and when this year’s Budget proposals
                do not seem to take any of this into account?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Programme for Government sets out our
                stall for a better future and is the first step in creating a
                better society for all. However, it needs to be clear not just
                on its objectives but in how they are to be achieved. That means
                that we have to fund the targets set out and make them
                achievable. If that involves asking the Dublin Government to
                provide additional funding, that is what we must do. Given that
                we do not receive enough from the British Exchequer and that we
                have not seen any money coming from savings made from the
                British war machine, we have to be imaginative about how to fund
                our priorities in order to achieve these aspirations. Go raibh
                maith agat.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCarthy:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The words &quot;cohesion&quot;,
                &quot;inclusion&quot; and &quot;justice&quot; underpin the
                implementation of all Government policies and programmes. These
                are laudable sentiments and can only be welcomed. However, after
                reading the document I am sad to say that I am disappointed. I
                want a cohesive, inclusive and just society, but I am afraid
                this Programme for Government does not deliver. It falls far
                short, leaving too many things unsaid and too many problems
                unsolved.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am heartened by today’s developments in
                the Assembly. I presume that since only Minister McGimpsey and
                Minister de&nbsp;Brún are speaking, they will also be speaking
                for their Colleagues in other Departments. It is indeed
                reassuring that the Executive is so cohesive and so inclusive
                that the Minister of Health can speak on behalf of the present
                Minister for Social Development.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Alliance Party, without the help of the
                Economic Unit special advisers and a building filled with civil
                servants, has already put forward its own Programme for
                Government and has even managed to deliver it before the
                Executive. We agree with the Government on some points. We too
                call for a consolidated Equality Act and for the application and
                monitoring of equality schemes, but even here the Executive’s
                plans fall short. We want the fair employment categories widened
                to apply to all of our increasingly diverse society, but the
                Programme for Government makes no mention of this.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We want the existing legislation applied to
                tackle the problems of graffiti, illegal flags and paramilitary
                murals that pollute our public places and intimidate the average
                person in Northern Ireland and visitors too, but the Programme
                for Government makes no mention of this either.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We would like to see the Assembly’s taking
                the lead in ensuring equality in its workforce through the use
                of innovative programmes such as flexible working, job- sharing,
                childcare provision and disability access. As an elected
                representative I think that part of my duty to the electorate is
                to lead by example, and this Assembly affords us an opportunity
                to do so, but the Executive ignore this, and there is no mention
                of it in its document.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I very much welcome the commitment to
                providing free travel for older persons. Members will know of my
                concern and interest in all areas affecting the elderly. The
                Alliance Party has advocated this policy for some time now; we
                feel this is necessary in order to build the inclusive society
                that we desire. We believe that this commitment is so important
                that it should have been specified that the Assembly fund this
                travel — not the councils by using rates. Alliance does not
                want to pass on the responsibility for this programme to
                overstretched councils which are already juggling many resource
                demands. However, I do not find this commitment in the document.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have also called for the establishment of
                a public health strategy, as does the Programme for Government.
                We have called for all policies and legislation to be audited
                for their impact on people’s health.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of course I cannot speak on health matters
                without spending a few moments talking about hospital closures
                and, indeed, condemning last week’s scandalous inability of
                the Ulster Hospital, due to a lack of finance, to provide a bed
                for a seriously burnt patient from Bangor. I say &quot;Shame on
                the Department and its Minister&quot;. I see that she is here
                today, and I hope she will take immediate action to ensure that
                this will not happen again.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Alliance advocates the innovative use of
                local hospitals by allowing them to develop into different areas
                of expertise. In this way more closures and bed shortages would
                be avoided while allowing for the concentration of specialities
                and a more efficient use of resources. It is hoped that this is
                the kind of policy the Executive will pursue, although no
                mention is made of it in the Programme for Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome many of the proposals, aims and
                actions in this document. However, I believe that they fall
                crucially short of providing for an inclusive society. We in the
                Alliance Party want to see the Assembly promoting sharing over
                separation and leading by example.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Hendron:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Health has been defined as being a state of
                complete physical and mental well-being and not merely the
                absence of disease. It is a fact that the health of Northern
                Ireland’s population, is, in general, not as good as that of
                other similar countries in western Europe. There must be major
                improvements in people’s health, especially in the case of our
                children and young people, since our future rests on their
                development. We need to ensure that our policies and programmes
                take account of their needs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has been concern in recent years over
                the quality of provision of children’s residential care
                services in Northern Ireland. The Health, Social Services and
                Public Safety Committee, as part of its scrutinising role, has
                conducted an inquiry on residential and secure accommodation for
                children here, and we hope to present the report of that inquiry
                to the Assembly before Christmas.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.00 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Too many of our children are living in
                poverty. As stated in the Programme for Government, we
                acknowledge the close relationship between family poverty and
                higher infant mortality, between poor general health and an
                increased risk of social problems. When a child is born its IQ
                (intelligence quotient) is partly due to genetic factors but, as
                it gets older, intelligence is also due to environmental
                factors. So it is not just a question of being born bright or
                stupid; a child’s development is also affected by its
                environment. Therefore a school-aged child from an
                underprivileged area or from a family living in relative poverty
                is at a gross disadvantage compared to other children in the
                community, especially with regard to education and health. That
                point has been proven over and over again and is supported by
                examination results in some areas. Of course we pay tribute to
                the people who are teaching them, but young people from poor
                backgrounds are at a gross disadvantage. They encounter higher
                levels of unemployment, and what jobs they do get seem to be the
                lesser types of jobs. In areas like that, young people are also
                more likely to smoke.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The problem of inequality in health must be
                tackled. Diet also affects lifestyle, and this is a factor that
                many of us try to teach our children. Hamburgers and fast food
                are particularly dangerous. Members may remember the experiment
                in Vietnam on thousands of young Americans aged between 18 and
                20, whose post mortem examinations showed that most of these men
                were found to have atheroma. In other words, the hardening of
                their arteries started during their childhood.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCarthy spoke about the elderly. The
                recent findings of the Royal Commission on the elderly should be
                implemented. That is a massive debate on its own.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall move on to the issue of young people
                with learning difficulties. Much has been said about Muckamore.
                I am sure the Assembly supports the Friends of Muckamore in
                hoping for the very best for their people. A lot of them are
                adults who have been there for many years — if they are to
                move into the community, there must be proper resources to
                assist them. Some people would like those patients to stay in
                Muckamore for longer than necessary, but human-rights
                legislation stipulates that such people are entitled to proper
                care in the community. Provided that the proper care is
                available there, we support their return to the community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The ongoing crisis in hospitals is a massive
                subject, but we will not resolve that by attacking individuals
                — and certainly not by attacking the Minister. The problems go
                back for years, when beds were closed by other Administrations.
                When beds are closed you cannot just open them up again. You
                need the resources and you need trained nurses. Some of the
                boards are getting nurses from abroad. I am sure they are very
                able girls, but a consultant recently told me about a nurse
                trained in the United States, who had impressive qualifications.
                When asked to take a patient’s blood pressure, she did not
                know how to do it. I am not belittling that nurse — she was
                trained in a certain way — but training is a major problem. I
                know that the Minister and the Department are tackling it, but
                all of us must work together on this crisis.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My last point is on primary care. The
                Minister is publishing her document, and I hope it will affect
                everybody in this Chamber and every person in Northern Ireland
                in primary care.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr B Hutchinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When we get to this stage, after having
                talked so much, there tends to be a lot of repetition. The
                Programme for Government affords an excellent opportunity for us
                to discuss policy. As other Members mentioned earlier, this is
                the first time in 25 years that something like the Programme for
                Government has been discussed by local representatives. However
                that does not mean that we should refrain from criticism, and
                there are a lot of things in this document which do need to be
                criticised.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This document seems to be very aspirational.
                It uses a lot of flowery language. It actually talks about
                implementing new legislation and policies. However, it does very
                little about developing programmes, and that concerns me. For
                instance, as far as promoting equality and human rights, as
                stated on page 18, is concerned, the document simply lists all
                of the things that the Government must do anyway. It does not
                tell us how that is to be communicated to the communities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In terms of listing the actions to be taken
                to ensure human rights, the document could have stated how we
                could use affirmative action policies to meet the targets when
                set. That work has been lost in this draft programme, and I hope
                that Ministers consider including it at some stage. I hope
                people will forgive me for thinking that the Natural Law Party
                had been elected and is actually in Government. The proposal to
                set up centres for curiosity and imagination sounds like
                something it would come up with.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a Belfast City councillor, I know that
                there already is a good community arts sector. It is well
                organised and is coming up with lots of ideas. We need to take
                arts to the community so that people can understand what it is
                about. I get no sense of that when I look at the objective of
                setting up centres of curiosity and imagination. It is a very
                bland statement and suggests that people do not have imagination
                and are not curious about the arts. We need to be more positive
                rather than negative. Perhaps the Programme for Government will
                outline exactly what that means.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was astounded that people talked about how
                they were going to improve community relations by educating
                people together and building houses for them to live together.
                This programme does not mention anything about an integrated
                housing programme or integrated education. Yet people talk about
                both of those things helping improve community relations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Government have also shied away from the
                fact that Catholic and Protestant teachers are trained in
                different establishments. There is no mention in the document of
                why we need two teacher training colleges. Teacher training
                methods are the same, and it does not matter whether you are
                Protestant or Catholic. No one in the Government has talked
                about this. They have just come up with flowery language and
                aspirations suggesting that we intend to deal with community
                relations. We need to encourage people to live together and be
                educated together. Our present integrated school system has been
                refused funding by the Government, and it is parents, not the
                Government, who are driving it. We have actions in the draft
                programme to improve community relations, but there is no
                notion, or no mention, of how we are actually going to achieve
                it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Public health and the prevention of ill
                health were very well prioritised and well laid out.
                Unfortunately the issue of access to acute services in rural
                areas was not mentioned. That has been the subject of great
                discussion, and I had hoped to see how we would deal with it.
                The last action point says</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;by 2002, revise a curriculum for

                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It does not tell us what they are going to do
                to achieve this. I suggest we introduce education on
                relationships and sexuality. We need to think about things like
                this, rather than just make bland statements about revising the
                curriculum.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Berry:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have read the Programme for Government, and
                I do not know whether to laugh or to cry. There are not only
                contradictions between sections, but even within the sections
                themselves. I want to concentrate on section 3. The first thing
                that is apparent is the absence of reality and priority.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is nothing but a wish-list. If acted
                upon, it would require every other Department to be closed down
                to achieve these goals. This drives home the fact that if any
                Department needs to be reviewed, it is the present Health
                Department. If this Administration were to attempt to follow
                what is written here, they would either fail completely or
                require it to be very domineering. That, no doubt, would suit
                the terrorist ideology of the party to which the current
                Minister of Health belongs and which she represents.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, there are some very dubious claims
                made on the causes of ill health. There is an old saying that if
                one makes a half-truth the whole truth, it becomes a lie. Worse
                than that, no budget will ever be able to meet what the ideology
                of simply looking at alleged causes would require. We have a
                nanny state that is out of control.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We get the usual Republican rant about
                cross-border issues. The ordinary people will quite rightly fail
                to see how that will solve the real health problems in Northern
                Ireland or return accident and emergency services to, say,
                Whiteabbey. It will simply provide the most lucrative gravy
                train since fuel smuggling started. Perhaps it is a placement
                for unemployed terrorists.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thirdly, the number of areas that the
                Department presumes to have authority over, and seeks to
                control, is huge. Here is a programme that is going to look
                after housing, wages, family life, diet, disability, the
                mentally ill, the terminally ill, Sure Start, residential care
                — and the list goes on. It is little wonder that nothing is
                being done to deal adequately or effectively with these
                problems. The areas where goals will definitely be achieved
                should have been set out, and priorities should have been
                stated.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fourthly, I note that of all the hospitals in
                Northern Ireland only two get a mention in this document. I
                recall my Colleague Iris Robinson referring to the current
                Minister of Health as a west Belfast politician with a west
                Belfast mentality. That seems to have been borne out yet again.
                All the other hospitals do not matter enough to get a pledge for
                anything.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fifthly, there is a very suspicious and
                rather worrying statement on page 33. It reads</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Everyone has a right to timely quality
                care based on clinical and social need.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To use social need to determine health care
                is a very dangerous concept. Where is the proper view that
                health care is free to all? That point needs to be addressed.
                What rules will be used to determine this? Who will determine
                this? There seems to be a deliberate shift of emphasis in who is
                going to get health care. On this point alone this entire
                section should be scrapped and replaced with something
                acceptable.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The current section is too ambitious. By
                trying to do everything, little will be achieved. Furthermore,
                there is no mechanism in existence that could possibly monitor
                or control everything mentioned.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This section will not be fulfilled, and its
                failure to deliver will result in a deliberate falsification of
                what is achieved — on the same scale as was operated by
                bureaucrats under Stalin — to make it all read right in the
                newspapers. It will produce bureaucracy obsessed with image and
                spin. If the answers to written questions are anything to go by,
                that process has already begun.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, Mr Deputy Speaker. I do
                not know how I am going to follow that. Sinn Féin’s goal is
                to improve the health and social well-being of the people on
                this island. Everyone is entitled to access to a quality health
                service. We are all conscious of the social, cultural and
                economic inequalities that exist in the Health Service and other
                areas. Added to that, the poverty and disadvantage faced by our
                communities will have a direct bearing on the state of public
                health, on individual self-esteem and on human rights.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the statement in the draft
                Programme for Government where the Executive point out that they
                too recognise the inequalities in the life experience of our
                communities in poverty, health, housing, educational and
                economic opportunity and disability. I welcome the fact that the
                Executive are determined to tackle them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has been clear for quite some time — and
                it has been reaffirmed in the draft Programme for Government —
                that people in the North suffer from high levels of ill health.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The death rate shows that. The figures for
                problems such as heart disease and teenage pregnancy are among
                the highest in Western Europe. Given that record and the fact
                that the Programme for Government admits that the provision of
                services to treat illness is falling behind, we must ensure that
                the Department of Health is properly funded. The document says
                that the Barnett formula is not fair, but what have the
                Executive done to address the matter? Barnett himself has
                criticised the formula because it does not reflect need.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Under the heading ‘Working for a Healthier
                People,’ the overall strategy to improve public health focuses
                on reducing preventable disease, ill health and health
                inequalities. Does that mean that the Executive will work to
                redress the inequalities faced by people living west of the Bann?
                If the Programme for Government is realistically to tackle the
                cycle of disadvantage and focus on the causes of preventable
                diseases, it needs to ensure that policies, funding and
                programmes strike at these problems. Among the range of factors
                that contribute to disadvantage is low income, and there is also
                a close connection between family poverty and high infant
                mortality.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another priority of the Executive is to
                ensure that the environment supports healthy living and that
                recreational facilities are improved. Where does that leave the
                issue of glass-fronted fires, which statistics show have led to
                an increase in asthma among our young people? Will the money be
                provided to remove these fires, thus improving public health?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Have the Executive the power to direct local
                councils not only to improve but also to provide recreational
                facilities? For years, local councils have discriminated against
                working-class and Nationalist communities. While the lead
                Minister is Bairbre&nbsp;de Brún, cross-departmental
                responsibility requires that all Departments target resources to
                the most disadvantaged areas. I am disappointed that not all
                Departments are involved. We are all aware that health affects
                us all.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree that the action to produce
                cross-departmental plans for securing reductions in the main
                causes of ill health requires specific measures to reduce
                poverty by tackling the community differential. While the
                Programme for Government informs us of the implementation of the
                new TSN action plans there is no mention of whether those plans
                address the community differential, or whether resources have
                been skewed to the most disadvantaged areas. One example is the
                Grand Opera House in Belfast, which is entitled to grants under
                TSN as it falls in a TSN area. That omission needs to be
                corrected.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we are to provide timely and effective
                treatment, the Programme for Government must address the
                allocation, location and siting of resources. We must ensure
                that the proposal for a modern acute hospital service and the
                measures to maintain, where possible, safe and effective
                services at smaller hospitals do not result in even greater
                levels of disadvantage. If the trend towards centralisation of
                services in bigger hospitals, particularly in the Greater
                Belfast area, is not reversed, many rural communities will be
                further disadvantaged.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ill health is not confined within borders,
                and given the size of our island there is a necessity for us to
                work together and address health issues on an all-Ireland basis.
                The Programme for Government includes an action point to take
                forward work in the North/South Ministerial Council giving an
                immediate priority to cancer, et cetera. As a party, we are
                clear about the importance of that work. However, we recently
                witnessed the First Minister playing politics by vetoing Sinn
                Féin. Given Mr Trimble’s clear disregard for people’s
                health, will the North/South Ministerial Council be able to
                function on health issues?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr S Wilson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The last speech indicates the flaws in a
                Programme for Government that allows the bone-breakers of
                IRA/Sinn Féin to stand up and eulogise about human rights and
                the health of the community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister used colourful language to
                describe the Programme for Government: it is a road map; it is a
                contract between the Assembly and the people. On a previous
                occasion he called it a shining light in the dark recesses of
                Government. When we look at the Programme for Government, we see
                that it is none of those things.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to talk about a few issues to
                illustrate this. Chapter 2 talks about the viability and the
                integrity of rural and urban neighbourhoods. The Government are
                committed to maintaining those. When the Minister of Education
                came to the Education Committee, I asked him what that meant.
                How would the Department of Education fulfil that part of the
                contract? Would he give the same treatment to small rural
                schools that he is offering to Irish-medium schools, where they
                can start if they have twelve pupils? He would not give that
                commitment, yet this is meant to be a contract. He would not
                give any commitment. He either would not or he could not, and
                yet we are told that this is a contract.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are told that it is a road map which will
                tell us how to get from one place to another. There is a lot of
                information in it about tackling disruptive behaviour and
                raising literacy standards. When I asked the Minister of
                Education if he would he give me just three things that would be
                done — three ways of getting from one place to the other —
                to improve literacy standards, he could not give them, yet this
                is meant to be a road map. Perhaps his reluctance to answer
                questions is a hangover from his previous employment, when he
                found that answering questions was a rather dangerous
                occupation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As has been said by other Members today, on
                one hand we are told that the Programme for Government has been
                carefully costed — that is what the First Minister said this
                morning — and then in the next breath he told us that we have
                to use our imagination. Either it has been carefully costed, and
                there are commitments, or it has not. It is odd that we are
                given some specifics — for example, so many houses will be
                improved. However, in other cases we are just given vague
                generalisations. If the whole of this programme has been costed,
                surely we ought to be able to know what lies behind each
                statement. The vast majority of these statements use words like
                &quot;we will establish&quot;; they say that they will continue
                to do something, or produce certain things, and the specifics
                are left out. The cynic would say, of course, that they are left
                out so that when they are not delivered, you cannot point the
                finger at anybody.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is the contract we are being asked to
                sign. I do not believe that this draft Programme for Government
                is an important document. I do not believe that it shines a
                searchlight into the darker recesses of Government, nor indeed
                is it a contract which any lawyer would encourage you to sign. I
                have given two or three examples, to illustrate the point.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is a contract so full of loopholes that
                it could be better described as a fishing net. For that reason,
                I believe that those who really want to see effective, efficient
                and accountable government in Northern Ireland would say that it
                falls short and is not worthy of support in its present form.</p>

                I am disappointed that the Programme for Government did not
                mention the private finance initiative (PFI), which was
                introduced by John Major’s Conservative Government in 1992.
                The motivation behind PFI was to reduce public expenditure at a
                time when public borrowing was out of control. Put simply, the
                aim of PFI was to achieve public sector investment without
                appearing to increase public sector borrowing. It was a sleight
                of hand in many ways.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has been strongly opposed by Unison, the
                largest union in the public sector. Significantly, the British
                Medical Council has added its voice to those opposing PFI. The
                British Medical Journal described PFI as</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;perfidious, financial idiocy that could
                destroy the NHS.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">PFI is expensive and wasteful.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Private finance initiatives will damage the
                NHS, now and in the future, and PFI projects are escalating in
                both scale and cost. They reduce pay, employment and working
                conditions. Most importantly, PFI represents an unacceptable
                increase in the privatisation of economic and social life.
                Critically, PFI involves the determination of such public
                services as health and education, using unaccountable,
                commercial criteria rather than those based on social need. In a
                nutshell, PFI represents profit before people. This has been
                illustrated by the latest increase in electricity charges by a
                rate three times greater than the rate of inflation. People are
                now being asked to get subsidies for private investment which
                will be paid for by the Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A further example of this theory is the
                privately owned car park at the Royal Victoria Hospital, the use
                of which by staff is subsidised by the board. Money is being
                paid out by the board to a private investor, when it should be
                being asked to reduce the board’s expenditure. In the
                education sector, the closure of school maintenance depots,
                because of the contracting out of services under PFI, is
                creating job losses. School governors have to be more careful
                about their expenditure, with the result that school maintenance
                is affected.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since the Labour Government came to power,
                £45 million has been paid out by the Department of Health to
                lawyers, financial advisors and other consultants. Government
                figures issued last March show that the bill for PFI consultants
                since 1997 would pay the salaries of 3,230 nurses for one year.
                It would also have allowed the Health Secretary almost to double
                the allocation of new money for heart operations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Private companies which build or refurbish
                hospitals to lease back to the National Health Service earn over
                £20 million. Financial consultants have been paid £20 million,
                while other consultants have received £10 million. We can only
                guess at how many beds this wasted money, used to subvent
                private investment, could have provided for the Health Service.
                The private finance initiative is merely a dressed-up term for
                privatisation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Essential services, such as health and
                education, must remain under the protective responsibility of
                public bodies, the core responsibility of Central Government. No
                party which calls itself a social democratic party or, like Sinn
                Féin, a Socialist Republican party — and I do not use the
                term &quot;Socialist&quot; in a dialectic sense — indeed, no
                party with a social conscience, which cares about the protective
                social fabric of our society, can give way to the concept of PFI
                without scrutinising the social implications of a laissez- faire
                attitude towards it for health and education. We must not allow
                PFI to compromise further those who are already socially and
                economically disadvantaged.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is the Unionist/Protestant community to go on
                as over the past decades with a give, give, give policy and the
                Nationalist/Roman Catholic community with more, more, more or
                take, take, take tactics before finally, if ever, admitting that
                they feel a sense of justice for all? Is there even a faint
                possibility that at the dawn of that ever- elusive day, any
                remaining members of the Unionist community will feel that same
                sense of justice and enjoy life in such &quot;a secure and
                cohesive society&quot;?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In one of the few places in this Programme
                for Government where actual, hard and fast figures are given, we
                are informed that Province-wide there will be 400 more offers
                under access to work, 50 places in employment support and 60
                work trials under the job introduction scheme. Almost 510 jobs
                are envisaged. Then follow 26 paragraphs promising arbitration
                schemes, accessibility to culture, improved transparency, new
                formulae, equal impact assessments and cross-departmental
                approaches. This soaring list of promises lacks one notable
                entity — specific quantities. Until we read 26 paragraphs,
                there are no figures of any kind.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Then we see some figures which are very
                specific. By keeping to the present level of co-owners’
                support, 570 families Province-wide will gain a foothold on home
                ownership; 36 more families will be allowed to purchase from
                housing associations per year; and disabled people will have
                access to 1,500 more buildings in the Province. The paucity of
                these figures sits uneasily beside the grandiose schemes
                described on those pages where no parameters are given at all.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Under heading 2.2.1. the final action
                promised is a review of the appointment and promotion procedures
                in the Northern Ireland Senior Civil Service. Does this herald
                another purge of Protestant senior civil servants? These people
                have worked for years to obtain by merit a high position in
                their chosen field only to be replaced by someone who claims
                discrimination and who gains under the politically correct
                banner of under-representation. Perhaps we should see any such
                allocations as the workings of TSN &quot;re-direction of
                resources&quot;. The senior civil servant now holding the
                resources will henceforth be discriminated against in favour of
                another, who will be positively singled out for preferential
                treatment. Will this ever further the core element of a feeling
                of justice for all?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh míle maith agat, a LeasCheann
                Comhairle. A recent newspaper editorial read</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Why don’t our leaders tell it as it
                is? Nothing will ever be the same again in this island.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The UK and Irish Governments have signed an
                internationally binding agreement regarding the future of this
                island and specifically in respect of the Six Counties. This
                means great change for all of us here, and for some people this
                is the change that they cannot countenance. Painful as it may
                be, change allows the possibility of debate and a dignified
                response to this Programme for Government. If we do not all pull
                together on this, we may be in danger of pulling ourselves
                apart. If that happens our communities will suffer.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important that the Programme for
                Government extends the opportunity to all citizens of this
                country, North and South, to get real and to join together in
                seeking new solutions to new problems and new solutions to old
                problems. That might enable us to address the current paranoid
                myth which says that if Catholics get more, Protestants will get
                less. Targeting social need means that whatever their religious
                or political beliefs, resources must be targeted at those most
                in need. If through the Programme for Government we create
                equality, parity of esteem, rights, and action TSN, really
                nothing will be the same again. The promotion of equality and
                human rights is now enshrined within law and central to the
                agreement, as they are to the Programme for Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They must form the basis, not in rhetoric but
                in action, of how this Programme for Government will address the
                most vulnerable members of society, the young, the old, the
                victims and survivors of the conflict, the disabled, the
                travelling communities, those living west of the Bann and those
                on the Shankill&nbsp;Road. However, the Programme for Government
                does not tell us how the Assembly will contribute to the Bill of
                Rights, as outlined in the Good Friday Agreement. Nor does it
                tell us if the Assembly will set up a cross-party human rights
                Committee.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In terms of victims, the Northern Ireland
                Office, which represents the state, needs to acknowledge that it
                has not been a passive or neutral player in the experience and
                management of conflict and is therefore not a neutral or passive
                player in managing how the needs of victims of state violence
                are met. In this respect it is not clear under
                paragraph&nbsp;2.2 what exactly will be the nature of the cross-
                departmental strategy group or the interdepartmental working
                group, and how these will relate to the victims’ liaison unit
                and the victims’ unit, and these to date have created total
                confusion among victims and contributed to the notion of a
                hierarchy of victims. The work of groups who are dealing with
                victims of state violence at grass-roots level is being
                constantly undermined by the victims’ liaison unit and the
                victims’ unit, not to mention the duplication of resources.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Under paragraph 2.3.1, travellers, the most
                marginalised group on this island, are discussed. From 2001 it
                is proposed to develop appropriate permanent accommodation to
                meet travellers’ needs. Having listened to a direct rule
                Minister some years ago, I had hoped that this particular
                programme would be under way. I am now told that it is not. In
                paragraph&nbsp;2.3 we find these words:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;ensure appropriate measures are taken
                to address the educational needs of Traveller children and
                children from other ethnic minorities&quot;,</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Programme for Government does not tell us
                how or when this will happen or what timescale is envisaged.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In terms of employment support for the
                disabled, some of those who were encouraged to sign on for New
                Deal programmes are now being penalised by losing entitlements
                to disability living allowance and incapacity benefit. Under
                paragraph&nbsp;2.2.1 it is not clear how the needs of the
                disabled will be addressed in terms of access for them to
                sports, arts and venues.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, I would like to welcome free travel
                for our senior citizens, which will now bring us into line with
                provisions in the Republic.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Under paragraph 4.3</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;We will seek to ensure that all our
                young people have the skills and qualifications to gain
                employment in a modern economy.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To address this inequality, we must, as
                stated, concentrate on the digital divide and explore ways to
                equip those living in the most disadvantaged areas to exploit
                the opportunities of technology. How do we propose to make all
                our young people computer literate? Existing plans for 4,200
                additional undergraduate places by 2004 must address the
                disparity of places in those disadvantaged areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, I welcome the proposed single
                equality Bill, which may address the existing discrimination in
                terms of gender, employability, and the elderly.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Robert Coulter:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I give a broad welcome to the Programme for
                Government. Much has been said about its aspirational language.
                However, at the beginning of section&nbsp;3, there is an honest
                recognition that our general health record is not good. Even
                though the Health Department has inherited an array of National
                Health Service problems, once we recognise the initial premise,
                we can instigate the necessary programme of activity to redress
                the wrongs. You only have to look at the thousands on waiting
                lists, the cancelled operations and the long waiting times at
                accident and emergency units to know that there is a need for
                immediate action. If we are to tackle these problems
                effectively, it is essential that we focus on their causes and
                ensure that our policies and programmes tackle them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the next paragraph states</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;We need to create the right
                socio-economic conditions and break into the cycle of
                disadvantage which is the major cause of ill-health.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That has not been proven philosophically or
                otherwise. Reducing preventable disease must be the first
                objective of any health service. I am glad that the programme
                will demand the attention of other Departments — seven others
                are mentioned. The Department of Health’s problems cannot be
                seen in isolation as being the answer to the problem that faces
                us all. The causes of ill health must be taken on board, and
                throughout this section we are returning to the primary cause of
                our future needs — dealing with the causes of ill health.
                Modernising and improving hospitals and the primary care
                services is also considered, and the logic of the argument for
                acute hospitals is sound and acceptable.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I spoke to a group of people in the
                south-west of the Province the other evening, and they admitted
                that no one would mind going to acute hospitals for acute
                services. The problem is not with the acute hospitals, but with
                the aftercare. When the operation is over and the patient is in
                need of 24-hour professional nursing care, he is sent home
                because the acute hospital is so busy and under such demands.
                Therefore, I suggest that the acute hospitals cannot be looked
                at in isolation. Mention is given to developing proposals for a
                modern acute hospital service. We must take steps, where
                possible, to maintain safe and effective services at the smaller
                hospitals. I am sorry that more attention was not paid to
                providing aftercare in community or convalescent hospitals in
                the main centres of population.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">New management arrangements for the
                recruitment and training of additional nursing and front-line
                staff were mentioned. We have already heard about the problem
                someone in one of our major hospitals faced the other evening.
                He was looking for an acute bed for a seriously ill patient and
                could not find one. Finally, Craigavon Hospital said that it had
                found enough nurses to man another acute hospital bed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This section deals with the very heart of the
                problem in our modern Health Service — the lack of nursing and
                front-line staff. That is the critical problem. Following a
                motor accident in my part of the Province, North Antrim, the
                victims had to be taken to Craigavon Hospital for treatment,
                when there were two hospitals within 20 miles of the scene of
                the accident. What can be done, or what should be done, about
                that? The Ambulance Service was also mentioned —</p>

                It is difficult not to feel like a member of the band on the
                Titanic when debating this issue. In the week that the Programme
                for Government was launched, the First Minister and his party
                were plotting an exit strategy from these institutions. Granted,
                the First Minister’s was a temporary exit strategy while
                others in his party would prefer a permanent one.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The future of the Programme for Government
                may be dubious, but it is important to comment on the equality
                aspects in the document. Sinn Féin will be measuring the
                potential success of the Programme for Government against its
                stated ability to deliver on equality obligations — to deal
                with entrenched social, economic and cultural rights as well as
                with the civil and political ones at the heart of its
                operations; to tackle the religious differential in employment;
                and actively to target social need.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.45 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Bearing that in mind, it is disconcerting
                that the mission statement in paragraph&nbsp;11.2 fails to
                mention equality or measures for tackling structural
                discrimination. The section on promoting equality and human
                rights fails to take advantage of the scope for positive
                discrimination. The action plan does not mention the strategy
                for tackling religious differentials in employment, and it does
                not refer to partnership arrangements to deliver any of the
                programmes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the section on tackling poverty and social
                disadvantage, the Executive missed a golden opportunity to put
                in place an anti-poverty strategy encompassing all sectors. TSN
                alone will not address society’s deep-rooted problems of
                poverty and disadvantage. This requires a unified, strategic
                approach across Departments and sectors, with a commitment of
                resources as well as specific goals and timetables.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Paragraph&nbsp;2.5.2 fails to take into
                account the position afforded to the Irish language under the
                Good Friday Agreement, and it does not apply the equality duty
                to the rights of the Irish-language community. Paragraph 1.16
                refers to the equality impact assessment carried out on the
                Programme for Government. How was this done; who was consulted;
                and what were the recommendations? The equality duty places an
                obligation on Departments to consult on the equality impact of
                all functions and policies — how was this done?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We challenge the assertion that it is not
                possible to apply a detailed impact assessment of equality to
                the whole Programme for Government. A method for this must be
                found and, as far as possible, it should be uniform across the
                Departments. The Executive and the Programme for Government
                should not be exempt from monitoring and impact assessment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sinn Féin believes that the Equality Unit’s
                suggestion in the Programme for Government and the Budget that
                the criteria for measuring need should vary according to the
                policy or practice under consideration by the Department or
                public body is a charter for chaos. There must be consistency in
                how need is measured if the same need is to be addressed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A further difficulty is the scheduling of
                publications. While there are references throughout the document
                to TSN action plans, these plans are not available to the
                public, so no one can judge the efficacy of claims made about
                the delivery of equality and TSN to detailed actions and
                budgets. It is therefore impossible for the beneficiaries of the
                Programme for Government to make any genuine assessment of it.
                This must be urgently addressed to ensure that there is full
                delivery and accountability.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">TSN is a policy initiative. It is
                complementary to the equality duty, and it must be governed by
                that fact. It is therefore illogical that TSN action plans have
                not been included in the Programme for Government to ensure
                scrutiny in the context of this duty. TSN should be redesignated
                as a public expenditure priority and featured as such within the
                Programme for Government and the Budget. The TSN action plans
                must be formulated in compliance with the statutory duty to
                promote equality of opportunity and detailed explicit programmes
                of affirmative action with targets and timetables deliberately
                designed to lift those most disadvantaged in our society. This
                has not been done, and that is a major flaw in both documents.
                This also distorts the debate on the equality duty and the
                eradication of religious discrimination in this society. Go

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister for Social Development (Mr
                Morrow): </b>I speak as the Minister for Social Development,
                dealing with matters within my brief, unlike other Ministers who
                have wandered outside the areas of their briefs. I assure
                Members that my Department and I will continue to work
                vigorously to promote the interests of the most deprived and
                marginalised members of society. Meeting social and economic
                need lies at the core of my Department’s programme, and that
                is strongly reflected in the Programme for Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Within my Department the provision of
                affordable social housing is a key priority and a vital
                component of regeneration and the promotion of social inclusion.
                People in Northern Ireland, particularly those on low incomes
                and the disabled, expected us to produce effective policies for
                meeting their housing needs, to tackle unfit accommodation and
                to enable them to get on the ownership ladder. My aims are to
                provide affordable social housing, promote more effective and
                economical heating systems, maintain or improve the present
                level of co-ownership, increase the numbers who can buy their
                homes from housing associations and increase the number of
                adaptations to existing buildings to improve access for disabled
                people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In my recent meeting with the Social
                Development Committee on the Programme for Government, the
                Committee indicated that it would like to have seen specific
                mention made of improving the level of unfitness in rural
                housing and the setting of more measurable targets. I wish to
                confirm that I will acknowledge these views as we continue to
                refine our commitments in the programme in the light of final
                decisions on the Budget for 2001-02. I have not yet decided on
                the rent increases for Housing Executive tenants from 1 April
                2001. I met the Committee recently, and I discussed this matter.
                It has deliberated, and I am awaiting its views.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another key priority for the Department for
                Social Development is tackling poverty and social exclusion,
                particularly where children are affected. I am determined to
                target its causes and effects. I was disappointed that action
                for children was not accorded a higher priority in the Programme
                for Government. We will ensure that all objectives in the new
                targeting social need action plans are achieved, and we will
                work with other Departments to promote social inclusion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly has passed the Child Support,
                Pension and Social Security Act, which is awaiting Royal Assent.
                It will help to ensure better support for children and
                improvements in the provision of retirement pensions. It is the
                only piece of substantial legislation that has been passed by
                the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is continuing evidence of deprivation
                and social exclusion in the Province. The Department for Social
                Development must take the lead in implementing definable
                improvements in disadvantaged neighbourhoods and assist in
                empowering local communities. A new urban regeneration strategy
                will be launched early in 2001, aiming to bridge the gap between
                the most deprived neighbourhoods and the rest of Northern
                Ireland, lower long-term unemployment, reduce crime and promote
                better health and educational qualifications. There will also be
                strong linkages to the provision of good and affordable housing.
                Inner north Belfast will benefit greatly from the URBAN II
                programme. It is an excellent opportunity to address, in a
                co-ordinated way and with local people, the physical and
                economic decline and dislocation of the community infrastructure
                in that area.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I recognise and appreciate the work of the
                various voluntary and community organisations in Northern
                Ireland. The Programme for Government reflects the important and
                invaluable contribution these organisations make to the social
                and economic well-being of our community. The Department for
                Social Development will continue to work to maximise the
                contribution this sector can make to the delivery and
                implementation of the programme.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to emphasise that the actions I
                have outlined are not merely aspirational; rather we are
                embarking on clearly focused programmes of work. In due course
                these will be underpinned by measurable targets and objectives
                against which our performances can be assessed. I have agreed to
                share this information with the Social Development Committee.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The social security system plays an important
                role in the social and economic life of Northern Ireland. The
                majority of people who claim benefits do so honestly and
                properly. We know, however, that others do not, and I am
                determined to take whatever action is necessary to prevent fraud
                and abuse of the system. The targets I have set for reducing
                fraud and error levels are challengeable and realistic.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, the provisions in the Programme for
                Government reflect the priorities and direction of the
                Department for Social Development. They take account of the
                Department’s draft budget allocations, but they can be further
                refined in the light of the views given in the consultation
                programme. I am grateful for the constructive and positive
                contribution the Social Development Committee has made in our
                discussion programme. I will take its views on board as we
                proceed. There is much more I would like to say, but time does
                not permit me to say it.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A wide range of issues has been raised by
                Members in the course of the debate, and I would like to address
                as many of them as possible. Clearly time is of the essence. I
                will try to cover as many points as possible, including those
                that are the responsibility of other Ministers, drawing as
                necessary on material provided by the relevant Departments. Any
                points I am unable to address may be covered at a later stage in
                the debate, possibly in writing by the relevant Minister.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nigel Dodds said there was nothing new, and
                Billy Hutchinson asked for further detail. Unfortunately neither
                is here to hear the answer. In the Programme for Government we
                have set out very clear priorities and detailed plans of action
                to carry them through, using the available resources to improve
                people’s health, education and skills, create jobs, tackle
                disadvantage and protect the environment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dodds asked specifically about funding for
                the North/South Ministerial Council. It must be pointed out that
                the figures in the Budget proposals were expressed on the basis
                of a financial year and therefore do not tally precisely with
                those initially agreed by the North/South Ministerial Council,
                which were based on a calendar year. Where the most is made of
                economies of scale, expenditure on North/South bodies —
                provided, of course, that they continue to exist and are not
                blocked — will save money, and this action will improve
                services for all throughout the island.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Éamonn ONeill asked if the money being
                allocated would address new priorities or merely be put to
                addressing underfunding in the recent past. I cannot speak in
                detail for each Department; that must be a matter for the
                Ministers themselves. In health and social services the money is
                going towards addressing problems which have arisen as the
                result of recent historical underfunding. Had we not had a
                situation in which, over the years, £190 million of savings
                were made by the Department — more than by any other local
                government section here — we would be in a very different
                position. Those savings were not put back into health and social
                services here, unlike in England where they were put back into
                the National Health Service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">John Kelly asked about the private finance
                initiative. The Programme for Government includes a commitment
                to review, by 2002, opportunities for the use of private finance
                in all major public service provisions and decide whether such
                partnerships are practical. There will be full public
                consultation to help us develop a cross- cutting public health
                strategy. We shall examine proposals for health impact
                assessment on all policies. Paul Berry said that was being
                overambitious for one Department. This is, of course, a
                cross-departmental strategy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given that time is of the essence, and since
                I see that people have left, I may pass over some responses in
                case I do not manage to deal with everyone’s questions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Kieran McCarthy, Robert Coulter and others
                raised specific questions about the Ulster Hospital and bed
                shortages in general. The draft Budget allocates an additional
                £7 million to combat the pressures on hospital beds and waiting
                lists in 2001-2002, and we will now be able to provide 13
                high-dependency beds to improve capacity in this vital area. In
                the Ulster Hospital, there will be two extra intensive care unit
                beds this year. Next year, there will be six extra
                high-dependency beds.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are very much aware that it is not merely
                a question of the beds themselves, and I welcome Robert Coulter’s
                comments about the need for a more integrated service. That is
                precisely what I wish to see. I appreciate Joe Hendron’s
                comments that we are addressing an inherited situation, and I
                have asked for a review of our acute hospital capacity to be
                completed by September 2001.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Billy Hutchinson asked about the promotion of
                equality and human rights. Specific actions to promote equality
                and human rights are detailed on pages 19 and 20.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No green-field, foreign direct investments
                have been secured for West Tyrone since April 1994. However,
                since that time the Industrial Development Board (IDB) has
                financially assisted eight expansion projects from externally
                owned companies, and these have created 372 new jobs and
                safeguarded 438 existing jobs.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Byrne:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has been great concern in West Tyrone
                for many years about the IDB’s track record in bringing inward
                investment to and creating jobs in this area. Does the Minister
                agree that the IDB’s track record is poor?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the Minister and his Department reassure
                the people of West Tyrone that they will put into practice the
                equality legislation and the new TSN in order to achieve
                balanced economic development across Northern Ireland? Will the
                Minister ensure that the IDB will exhaustively examine and
                evaluate all potential job creation projects presented to it,
                particularly any projects that may be currently on the desks of
                IDB executives? The people of West Tyrone are in grave danger of
                losing faith in the IDB because of its very poor record.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is unfair to condemn the IDB in that way.
                First, the IDB is committed, as is the Department, to working
                with local authorities. Only recently the IDB held a meeting in
                West Tyrone — in Omagh — and had discussions with many local
                representatives. The Department is fully committed to the
                equality legislation and has set a target for first time visits
                of 75% to new TSN areas. Currently that target is being
                achieved, if you take the Province as a whole, and we are
                strongly committed to ensuring that that continues.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to make a number of observations. The
                position in both council areas concerned is that there is
                continuing downward pressure on unemployment. Unemployment is
                falling in the Strabane and Omagh district council areas. If the
                Member cares to examine the most recent figures, published last
                month, he will see that that is the case. The difference is
                quite marked compared to two or three years ago.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most of the jobs created in West Tyrone, as
                with everywhere else, come from indigenous companies. Foreign
                direct investment is only responsible for a relatively small
                proportion of the new jobs created in Northern Ireland. The vast
                majority are created by businesses that are already there. The
                Local Enterprise Development Unit (LEDU) is extremely active in
                the area, and many client companies throughout West Tyrone are
                receiving attention.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other problems arise because of, for example,
                the concentration of the textile industry in that part of the
                county. The Member will be aware that the Department is very
                much involved at the moment with the textile sector. Next month
                I expect to publish the Kurt Salmon Associates proposals that
                have been created in conjunction with the industry, which is
                strongly represented in the Member’s constituency, and I look
                forward to the development of a strategy to help that sector.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I can assure the Member that, as far as this
                Department is concerned, West Tyrone and other new TSN areas
                will continue to receive a very high priority. We will continue
                to do everything in our power to strengthen the economic
                infrastructure in the area.</p>

                agencies that are already functioning in the area — for
                instance, both local authorities are extremely actively involved
                in economic development. We know that there are local
                partnerships, area partnerships and European partnerships, many
                of which have been extremely successful, and they are very
                vibrant organisations. I am conscious of the visit made by the
                First&nbsp;and the Deputy First Ministers to West Tyrone and of
                the matters they referred to. It is perfectly obvious that
                sometimes you reach a point where, although a great many
                organisations have been set up, things are not necessarily being
                done. You can sometimes have too many organisations. However, I
                would certainly be prepared to look at any realistic proposal.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I reiterate the point I made in my answer to
                the Member’s Colleague from West Tyrone. I am aware of the
                great pressure on the agriculture sector in West Tyrone. It is,
                however, outside our control; it has been imposed on us, not
                only by the currency differentials, which have affected the
                amount of support, but by a range of matters that have directly
                affected agriculture and had a knock-on effect. In fact, the
                progress that has been made on the industrial base in
                West&nbsp;Tyrone has, to some extent, been masked by the fact
                that the difficulties in the agriculture sector have been
                superimposed on it. Without making any firm commitment to the
                Member, I will certainly look at proposals, but I stress that
                there is a great deal of ongoing activity, and one would have to
                be convinced that any new suggestions would add value and not
                distract existing organisations from their current work.</p>

                an industry is growing up — it is called &quot;the development
                industry&quot; — around trying to attract money. In view of
                the fact that there has been such a downward trend in the
                farming industry and we now have the new poor in great measure,
                what is being done by LEDU to encourage indigenous industries?
                We need new infrastructure such as the Strabane stage 3 bypass,
                the Newtownstewart bypass and phase 3 of the Omagh bypass —
                which is £17&nbsp;million of investment — to make us much
                more viable from the point of view of transport — bear in mind
                that we have road transport services only. What is being done to
                ensure equality of opportunity? This is something that is
                levelled against all developing authorities. Things are more
                favourable for those who come from outside, but the local
                entrepreneur has great difficulties. What is being done to

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I must advise the Member that he must limit

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am conscious of the infrastructural
                weaknesses in the district. The Member has referred to some of
                the planned remedial measures, but there are others.
                Infrastructure is not confined to roads; it can and does include
                telecoms, which are basic infrastructure. I am currently
                studying a report on that matter, and it is perfectly clear that
                towns in the west of the Province will be directly affected. Our
                objective will be to ensure that there is as level a playing
                field as possible, because in respect of telecoms,
                infrastructure is fundamental to the ability to attract industry
                and business.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member feels that indigenous companies do
                not get the same attention as foreign investors. Over the next
                decade the vast majority of jobs created in Northern Ireland
                industry will have to come from indigenous companies. There is a
                trend for less direct foreign investment, and incoming projects
                are generally smaller than they used to be.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we have to create some 112,000 jobs over
                the next decade, they will not be created by direct foreign
                investment. They can only be created by indigenous companies or
                by the expansion of foreign-owned companies. The eight projects
                that have been supported by the Industrial Development Board,
                came from existing foreign-owned companies. The Local Enterprise
                Development Unit is active and successful in this area, and we
                are looking at the entire support package, and at the balance of
                that package, for the small business sector in particular,
                because that is the growth area of the future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ninety-nine per cent of companies in Northern
                Ireland employ fewer than 250 people, so if this sector is not
                receiving attention, then no sector is receiving it. I can
                assure the Member that these points will be kept in mind when we
                are reviewing the package.</p>

                IDB expects to see ProLogis Developments Ltd act as development
                manager, drawing down the land from the IDB on an agreed
                profit-sharing basis as occupiers fill the site. Additionally,
                it has spent £11·5&nbsp;million on the infrastructure and

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A number of Members have asked me about
                bureaucracy recently. Two years ago there was a review of all
                Government Departments and the necessity to produce paper for
                people to fill in. All the Department of Enterprise, Trade and
                Investment forms were reviewed, a number were eliminated and a
                number were redesigned. Within the last few weeks, I have asked
                officials to take each form and examine not only the need for
                the form but also the policy rationale for it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Tourism is the first section that is going to
                be done. The objective will be to see whether it is absolutely
                necessary to have the form, whether there is a statutory basis
                for it, and whether it is a policy issue or purely an
                informative issue. I am going to go through each division of the
                Department systematically to see if all these bits of paper are
                essential.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Having been in business myself, I know only
                too well how frustrating it can be. Some things are inescapable,
                as the Member will know from his own experience. Where public
                money is involved there are accountability issues. The
                Government need certain information, which can only be obtained
                by asking questions. I am conscious of the pressures that
                companies are under. I will be taking personal interest in this
                to see if it is absolutely necessary to have each piece of
                paper.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the Small Business
                Administration in the United States, I have met the Cabinet
                Minister responsible, Aida Alvarez. She gave a seminar in
                Belfast in December 1998. The Enterprise, Trade and Investment
                Committee delegation that went to Washington last August had a
                further meeting with Mr Charles Tansey, a senior official. There
                is no question that the potential of the loan versus selective
                financial assistance model is quite attractive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, there are statutory differences.
                First, the banking sector in the United States has certain
                statutory obligations to the community that do not obtain here.
                Secondly, where guarantees are given for loans, under current
                Treasury rules the Department would have to assume that the
                total value of the guarantee was spent. It would have to hold
                that cash back in reserve and not spend it. While those rules
                exist, or are applied in that fashion, there would be little
                gain. The American experience has been that only 5% or 6% of
                their loan book is actually called in in any one year, and
                Congress provides that revenue support, whereas under current
                Treasury rules we would have to provide 100% support.</p>

                Member is correct about advice and so on. It does require a
                degree of spreading out. Certainly there will be one office in
                the Greater Belfast area. I think there will be at least two
                pilots initially, but I take the point he is making. It really
                is a question of how the pilot projects run. If the demand is
                there, the principle could be applied to a whole range of other
                services outwith health and safety, which happens to be what I
                am focusing on at the moment.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am conscious of the point made by the
                Member. As he says, there is an opportunity for other
                organisations to be involved in the services. It will be an
                advice centre. I am aware that in Canada and in other places
                form-filling has been successfully dealt with in that way, and
                there is a very high take-up. We want these centres to be places
                where people can walk in off the street and have access. We have
                not yet worked out whether the pilot will be free or whether
                charges will be made, but we have to maximise the use of IT in
                the delivery of public services. We have a long way to go and,
                quite frankly, we are only at an early stage. I take the Member’s
                points under consideration.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Beggs:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister advised that the likely location
                would be in an existing public building. Does the Minister
                accept that that would further disadvantage those constituencies
                — for example, East Antrim — where the number of civil
                servants is already low?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member’s point is that from a
                cost-effectiveness point of view it makes sense for the centres
                to be in buildings that are already in public occupation rather
                than go to the expense of acquiring more buildings. The object
                of the exercise will be to ensure that on completion there will
                be a regional spread. We are only at the pilot stage, so we will
                have to see how it goes and learn. It may be that, if things are
                on line and available anywhere in the Province, the location of
                offices will be less significant, and what they actually do will
                be more significanct. It is too early to give the Member a
                definite answer, but I assure him that I understand the point he
                is making, and that will have to be taken into account when the
                final decisions are made.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGrady:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for his short reply to
                the question. It does not give me much to go on, but I draw his
                attention to statistics indicating that inward investment visits
                to the constituency of South Down and to Down District Council
                were consistently less than 2% each year over the past decade
                and beyond. The ministerial team said here on 17 October that,
                since December, the IDB has promoted 7,100 jobs — 3,000 more
                than in the previous year. I would like to know where those jobs
                went. They certainly did not go east of the Bann or to South
                Down.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am conscious of the Member’s
                representations. He has to be aware — he is aware — that the
                obligation on the IDB is to ensure that the maximum number of
                visits are to new TSN areas, and we are doing that to the best
                of our ability. However, people have to be aware that a company
                goes largely where it wants to go.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We can try to market an area, but a company
                will go where it wishes. Take the Down district area, for
                example. Between 3 July and 5 July of this year a Korean company
                visited the Down Business Park units. That was a repeat visit.
                Between 23 July and 25 July a USA company visited the area;
                between 24 August and 26 August a Korean company visited;
                between 1&nbsp;September and 3 September another Korean company
                visited; and between 27 September and 29&nbsp;September a third
                Korean company visited Down Business Park — again, that was a
                repeat visit.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is activity taking place, and I am
                conscious that Down District Council is working hard to help
                with the strategy for the Down Business Park, about which the
                Member has written to me on a number of occasions. I assure the
                Member that activity is taking place and that the IDB is
                involved in that. I have just mentioned five visits which have
                taken place since July&nbsp;2000.</p>

                investment projects at the Down Business Park in Downpatrick
                will not prevent similar investment projects from taking place
                at Killyleagh, some eight&nbsp;miles from Downpatrick? Does the
                Minister’s Department intend to make similar provisions in
                Killyleagh, in the light of the 200 to 250 job losses there in
                the last 18 months?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is an assumption that the IDB can tell
                a company which is coming to Northern Ireland from abroad
                &quot;We want you to visit here&quot; or &quot;We want you to go
                there&quot;. Members have to understand that the IDB cannot be
                as prescriptive as that. Clearly the pattern of business
                location in Northern&nbsp;Ireland has developed through the
                years as businesses have come and gone. We have projects such as
                Down Business Park, which the IDB has assisted in the
                development of. There is now a place in the district where
                companies can quickly establish manufacturing or other
                activities. I am conscious of the difficulties that arose in the
                textile industry in Killyleagh and the surrounding area in the
                Member’s constituency about this time last year. It is
                understandable that his Colleagues and he wish to draw attention
                to particular blackspots in their areas. However, Members should
                not exaggerate the degree to which the Government are able to
                determine where companies visit.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I take the point the Member has made and will
                ensure that the IDB is aware that it has to take into account
                other areas in addition to existing business parks where
                investment has already taken place.</p>

                West Tyrone are offered £1·5 million. That is how it goes in

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The reason the moratorium was imposed in the
                first place was that there were enough people prepared to build
                and establish hotels with their own money, without recourse to
                public resources. If any arbitrary limit is imposed, such as
                nine, 10 or 11 miles, there is always a difficulty because
                people get on the wrong side of the limit.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member will be aware that there has been
                a difficulty with hotels in the Lisburn area for a number of
                years. Hotels closed down at Hilden and elsewhere. It has been
                difficult for hotels to establish themselves in this area. Part
                of the reason for that is their proximity to Belfast and, of
                course, the Forte hotel has now moved to Belfast. I do not have
                plans to remove the moratorium at the moment, but if I were
                convinced that there was a need or that it would make a
                difference, I would reconsider my position. With regard to the

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for his report, which is
                fairly damming. It was envisaged that up to 4,000&nbsp;young
                people a year would participate in the programme. We have 254,
                with a drop-out rate of 139. The jobs are not satisfactory, and
                a review of the Walsh Programme is needed. I ask the Minister to
                review this issue, as it is not satisfactory.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Farren:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not accept that this is a damming
                situation, nor that it is unsatisfactory. The matter, with
                respect to the Walsh Visa Programme, has been under constant
                review from the outset. When the programme was put into
                operation it was recognised on all sides that the numbers
                originally targeted to participate annually were overly
                ambitious. That is the view of the Training and Employment
                Agency and FÁS, and is shared by the Department of Labor in the
                United States.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A number of drop-outs from the programme was
                expected, given the nature of the target group and the
                difficulties that they were already experiencing in the Northern
                Ireland labour market. The scale of the drop-out, however, is
                greater than anticipated and was a key issue for the scheduled
                review of the programme and the planning of the next phase.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since early summer officials in my Department
                have had regular contact with the Department of Labor in
                Washington and have visited the USA for discussions with them
                and the US programme administrator. While there some weeks ago,
                my officials and I took the opportunity to discuss and review
                the Walsh Visa Programme with the Department of Labor. I also
                met some of the young people participating in the programme. I
                assure Members that many of them were quite satisfied with the
                administration of the programme.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members will appreciate that there are many
                reasons, both personal and job-related, for so many drop-outs. I
                assure Members that when the review of the Walsh Visa Programme
                is complete, its reintroduction next spring will be in the light
                of a thorough consideration of all issues raised in the course
                of this year’s experience.</p>

                satisfied with the Walsh Visa Programme, especially those from
                the Newry and Mourne area. The uptake was not what some of us
                had anticipated — something similar to what happened with the
                Morrison Programme. Will the Minister outline his contacts with
                the United States and other officials regarding the Walsh Visa
                Programme?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The contacts are those mentioned in my
                response to the supplementary. Officials have been in regular
                contact with the Department of Labor, and FÁS, our co-partners
                in recruiting participants to the Walsh Visa Programme. On my
                recent visit to Washington I had a thorough discussion with
                representatives from the Department of Labor who are
                administering the programme. I visited and spoke with
                participants in two locations in the Washington area, and they
                expressed a considerable degree of satisfaction, some greater
                than others. Undoubtedly, in a programme of this nature, for
                some the experience has not lived up to expectations. It is
                important to remember that the Walsh Visa Programme is targeted
                on those who have experienced unemployment in Northern Ireland.
                Therefore, difficulties come into the programme as a product of
                those individual experiences. Some who have remained are gaining
                an invaluable experience, and some who have returned prematurely
                have brought home a positive experience. Not all come back with
                a negative attitude towards their experience in the United
                States.</p>

                problems which young people encountered earlier this year, is

                the contract. Only two companies tendered, and the successful

                It shows consistently that the majority of students — between
                64% and 67% over the past five&nbsp;years — came from the
                professional, intermediate and skilled non-manual groups. More
                than a third of new entrants — between 33% and 36% over the

                statistics since the width of social access to our student body
                is probably better than that in the Republic of Ireland and
                England. Nevertheless, there is room for improvement, and the
                Minister rightly referred to that recent and interesting
                research carried out in Dublin by the Higher Education
                Authority. Does the Minister agree with one of the report’s
                main conclusions, namely, that an increase in grant support to
                students is crucial to raising access for those from unskilled
                and skilled manual working- class backgrounds who are
                underrepresented?</p>

                rural properties as those located outside the Londonderry City
                Council area and the Belfast urban area, which is defined as
                including the Belfast, Carrickfergus, Newtonabbey, Lisburn,
                Castlereagh and North Down Council areas. Within this definition
                the Housing Executive planned improvement schemes for five years
                commencing in April 2000, and covering just over 7,000 of its
                properties. These involve either multi-element improvements,
                which may include a range of improvements, or single-element
                improvements. The latter involve specific upgrading: the fitting
                of kitchens, central heating installation, or major adaptation
                work such as property extensions. In addition, as part of its
                rural housing policy, within the next three to five years, the
                Housing Executive intends to make improvements to 800 of its
                rural cottages which still require them.</p>

                public-sector housing across Northern Ireland. Can the Minister
                tell the House what plans he and his Department have devised to
                tackle levels of rural unfitness in public-sector houses? Can he
                also assure the House that he will make the issue of tackling
                rural unfitness a priority for his Department?</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I come from a rural constituency. For that
                reason, among others, I can assure Members that rural unfitness
                gives me considerable concern. In County Fermanagh, for
                instance, the last survey showed that rural unfitness there runs
                at 17·1%. We hope that on the publication of the next report on
                rural unfitness, there will be a substantial fall in that toll.
                I can assure the Member that my Department and I take rural
                unfitness very seriously, and we will be devoting our energy to
                it in the coming weeks and months. The 1996 House Conditions
                Survey recorded just under 23,000 unfit dwellings in rural
                areas, excluding Belfast, Londonderry and other towns. This
                represents some 52% of all unfit properties. In 1996, rural
                unfitness was recorded at 12·1% — a reduction from 17·2% in
                1991. We are better off then than equivalent areas in the rest
                of the UK. We take little comfort from that, because we are
                still striving to ensure that we deal adequately with rural
                unfitness. My Department and I will be giving much time and
                attention to this issue in the future.</p>

                element improvement schemes at the expense of single- element

                improvements in the rural public housing stock is extremely long
                and is getting longer. In many of these houses, simple
                improvements to a kitchen or an electrical system may be the
                overriding priority. Would it not make more sense to do one
                scheme now and, perhaps, complete the other house improvements

                opportunity to effect real improvements. Has the Minister’s

                I will try to give some figures to indicate the impact of
                increasing rents at certain levels. The physical consequences of
                a GDP plus 2% rent increase’s not being imposed would be as
                follows: if we froze rents at their existing level, a loss of
                £13·6 million would be sustained. That would result in no new
                starts in the year 2000 and the deferral of 1,000 multi-element
                improvement (MEI) schemes.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.45 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we increased rents in line with GDP, which
                we are told we must calculate at 2·5%, a revenue shortfall of
                £7·8 million would result. There would be no new starts in
                2000, and 400 MEI schemes would be deferred. At GDP plus 1%, the
                shortfall would be £5·4 million, and there would be no new
                starts in 2000. At GDP plus 2%, the shortfall would be £3·1
                million, and there would be a choice between 2000 planned
                replacements or 1500 MEI schemes, but not both.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I trust that those figures clearly illustrate
                the impact that that will have on the housing scheme,
                particularly to the Member who said that the rate of rent
                increases should be below that of inflation. I ask the House to
                reflect on those figures and think about them carefully, because
                it is not a simple equation.</p>

                may or may not agree with the Committee’s views, but I assure
                the House that those views will be taken into consideration
                before any decision is made on any level of rent increase. I
                will take the decision. I will not ask the Committee to make my
                decisions for me. I am ready to make the decision, but it is
                only courteous to ask the Committee for its views and take those

                which many of the agencies will co-ordinate their efforts and
                information will become effective soon. I do not know if that
                will happen before this payment is made. The £200 payment was
                announced only last Thursday, and the legislation came into
                effect last Saturday. Some of the cheques will be sent this

                out to ensure that everyone who is on benefit and who is
                entitled to this payment will get their £200 before Christmas.

                co-operation with the Minister of Health. Given Mr&nbsp;P
                Robinson’s earlier comments on the need for joined-up
                government, and since Ministers carry responsibility for housing
                executive rents, is it not up to the Minister to co-operate with
                other Ministers in urgent matters of public concern, rather than
                leave them entirely to officials?</p>

                whatsoever to meet the Minister of Health, Social Services and
                Public Safety. I cannot be more direct than that. With regard to
                the matter he is hinting at, although he could be more explicit,
                the RUC is the main component in the drive against drugs. It is
                notable that the RUC has been excluded by the Minister of
                Health, Social Services and Public Safety. I thought that would

                the Hansard of 10 November, by doing so he would be ahead of

                Training and Employment (Dr Farren):</p>
                </font></b><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The focus of this session of the debate is on
                education, training, the economy and the infrastructure. This
                covers two of the Executive’s priorities, investing in
                education and skills and securing a competitive economy. These
                are key priorities to contributing to a prosperous society,
                which is part of the Executive’s shared vision for the future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Education and training have a central role in
                the programme, not only for social and community development but
                as an engine for our economy. While a high proportion of our
                young people achieve good examination results, there are also
                major challenges for us, as the draft programme highlights. The
                increasing focus on knowledge as a key element of economic
                growth emphasises the importance of getting our education and
                skills right. A high proportion of young people are
                underachievers in school, and they should be given every
                opportunity to succeed through access to quality higher and
                further education.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Within our existing work force there is a
                significant population with few or no formal qualifications and
                with poor standards of literacy and numeracy. We must continue
                to address areas of high unemployment. We must break the cycle
                of unemployment, making sure that we do not allow those leaving
                school with few qualifications to be caught in the unskilled
                trap for their future careers. As the programme highlights,
                these are areas we will focus on.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The selection review and decisions on the
                future structures of post-primary education, together with the
                outcome of the review of student financial support at further
                and higher education levels, will clearly be major vocal points
                of debate. The Executive have identified a wide range of other
                actions to underline its commitment to investment in education
                and skills at different levels: the provision of one year of
                pre-school education for every child; support for underachieving
                schools; the development of technology in public libraries; and
                the piloting of a new training programme for adults with basic
                literacy and numeracy problems.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the chapter headed ‘Securing a
                Competitive Economy,’ we emphasise that a firm basis for
                economic growth requires the close co-ordination of a wide range
                of policies and Departments. We must ensure that we have the
                physical infrastructure that business needs. We need to create
                the right conditions for economic growth by promoting
                competitiveness, enterprise, innovation and creativity. We plan,
                for example, to stimulate the private sector to increase the
                level and scope of research and development and to implement a
                small business strategy with a view to achieving better
                co-ordination and effectiveness of local enterprise support.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must also work to make Northern Ireland
                more attractive for inward investors and tourists. We need a
                competitive location for investment, while at the same time
                ensuring that sufficient investment is directed to areas of
                disadvantage and high unemployment. It is also essential that we
                have the appropriate infrastructure for competitive regional
                development, and meet the needs of individuals as well. We will
                agree, therefore, on a regional development strategy and a
                regional transport strategy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We will ensure that Northern Ireland has a
                world-class telecommunications infrastructure, and on that basis
                we will promote Northern Ireland as a world-class centre for
                e-commerce. We also need to consider the most appropriate energy
                infrastructure to help improve business competitiveness and
                create greater consumer choice at affordable prices. In striving
                to improve the economy we must be aware of the difficulties that
                have been experienced in rural areas. The Executive propose to
                develop a programme to modernise and diversify the structure of
                farming and assist fishery areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In taking this agenda for developing our
                economy and infrastructure forward, we must also ensure the
                protection and enhancement of the environment. We will,
                therefore, produce a strategy for sustainable development. This
                will cover a number of Departments and the district councils,
                because we have to build sustainability into all relevant policy
                areas including the development of public attitudes.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the draft Programme for Government,
                and I am pleased that we have the opportunity to discuss it in
                detail today. The Belfast Agreement has brought many benefits to
                the people we represent. At last, we have locally elected
                representatives producing a programme that we have the
                opportunity and resources to enact. At last, those who provide
                government in this Province can be held to account by the
                electorate. We can truly say that, through this programme, we
                are delivering accountable democracy to Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I commend the Executive on their role in
                guaranteeing that delivery. I applaud the commitment to a better
                society. My party and I will continue to do all that we can to
                help. However, the delivery of accountable democracy also
                requires that those of us who might loosely be referred to as
                Back-Benchers can and must criticise constructively where we
                find fault. I am reasonably satisfied that the draft programme
                will start to undo the damage caused to this country by direct
                rule. Having said that, I must also say that in some areas the
                programme does not do enough to address the years of under-
                investment, poor planning and general disregard that
                characterised long-distance Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Notwithstanding the announcement of increased
                funding for water and sewerage, not enough has been done to
                bring that vital area of infrastructure into the Programme for
                Government. It would be easy to single out the present Minister
                for criticism; he has not been in the job long and will soon
                have to hand over to the next man — or woman — in advance of
                the Westminster elections. We look forward to seeing who is next
                for a game of Ministers. Of course, it would help regional
                development generally if the Minister were fully committed to
                the portfolio. It would also help if the Minister were to carry
                through to the Executive the work his party is engaged in with
                the rest of us at departmental Committee level.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I acknowledge that addressing the direct rule
                years will be hard, and nowhere more so than in dealing with the
                Water Service. The damage was done over many years and cannot be
                undone by one Programme for Government. However, I regret that
                the opportunity to deal radically with the massive problems that
                we have with water and sewerage services has been missed. Rather
                than spend money on patching up an ailing infrastructure, we
                should aim at a complete overhaul.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Chapter 1 of the draft programme states</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The provision of infrastructure and
                major public services such as public transport, roads, water and
                sewerage are essential for the social and economic well-being of
                the region&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with that. It also states</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Serious deficiencies in our
                infrastructure assets have been identified as a result of years
                of under-investment&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with that too. The document continues</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;This is giving rise to real
                public-safety and public-health concerns. We need to act now if
                we are to reverse the unacceptable deterioration in the quality
                and reliability of our infrastructure and to comply with
                European Directives&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although the problem of underinvestment is
                identified, the draft programme contains little evidence of
                commitment to address it. There are some commitments to
                improvement. The commitment to achieve a 20% reduction in the
                1996 level of high- and medium- severity water pollution
                incidents is welcome, as is the commitment to eliminate the
                backlog in implementing European Directives on air, land and
                water. I am pleased with the commitment to achieve 80%
                compliance with the waste water treatment works discharge
                standards set out by the Environment and Heritage Service. I
                trust that, before too long, we will achieve 100%.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive must appreciate the importance
                of a good water and sewerage infrastructure; it is as good an
                indicator as any of our social and economic conditions. My
                constituency is a pleasant and attractive area, made up mainly
                of small towns and villages and surrounded by countryside. We do
                not live at the foot of enormous mountains or beside the banks
                of broad rivers, but, in south Antrim, we are beginning to
                expect that rainfall that is anything more than moderate will
                lead to flooding. The flooding occurs because the Water Service
                infrastructure is below standard.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The level of rainfall in Northern Ireland in
                October was among the lowest in the United Kingdom, but
                householders still had to deal with water seeping into their
                homes for the second time in two months. In an area of
                relatively mild rainfall, we should not have such a situation.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Lewsley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to concentrate on education. In order
                to attain equality in the present education system, we need to
                look at the targets set out in the Programme for Government and
                examine how to turn those targets into achievable objectives.
                How can we do that without adequate funding? Feedback from
                public meetings suggests that the overwhelming majority of the
                public feels that the 11-plus ought to be scrapped. Undoubtedly,
                the examination places pupils under severe pressure and is
                counter-productive and damaging in that it increases class bias
                and leads to social disadvantage, low self-esteem and
                demotivation. Preparation for the examination dominates the
                curriculum in P6 and in P7. Teaching is totally focused on
                preparation for the 11-plus, and attention is directed away from
                areas that would be more beneficial in the preparation for
                secondary education.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issue of the future of the 11-plus cannot
                be viewed in isolation. The structure of our education system
                must change radically to meet the needs of society today, as
                well as the needs of the future. Equality of opportunity must be
                built into the system. We must tackle underachievement; I
                welcome the Minister’s commitment to do so. I commend the
                allocation of funds to help children with special needs. That
                will enable them to enter mainstream education without having to
                face the terrible bureaucracy that they have faced in the past.
                For many of those children the issue is not just physical access
                to schools and classrooms but access to all the services in the
                schools. We must ensure that they are included, not isolated.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need equality of treatment for our rural
                schools and the retention of those schools, which play such a
                vital role for those who live in rural communities. Pupil
                numbers in rural schools are dropping, and the reasons for that
                must be examined. Decisions must be made about what can be done
                to revitalise those schools in order to extend equality of
                opportunity, accessibility and choice and to raise standards.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">School transport in rural areas needs a
                complete overhaul. It is neither fair nor realistic to expect
                young children to walk two miles along country roads, often with
                bad lighting and no footpaths. Children’s safety is of
                paramount importance, and transport is an essential element.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On school transport in general, I would
                advocate an approach that would ensure training for drivers and
                escorts, both on buses and in taxis, and particularly for those
                working with children who have special needs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While attending an Education Committee
                meeting recently I was glad to hear the Minister’s statement
                underlining his commitment to the three Rs and to what he termed
                &quot;the four Ens&quot; — encouragement, enjoyment,
                entitlement and enthusiasm. I hope that other initiatives and
                those proposed in the Programme for Government to tackle
                bullying and behavioural problems will be strengthened and that
                we will soon see a positive outcome from those and from other
                vital programmes currently running in our education system.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must ensure that we target social need and
                direct funding towards areas where it will benefit children in
                the greatest need. Targeting social need must be people-based,
                not geographically based as it is now. We need a second-level
                education that gives the same weight to vocational education as
                it does to academic education, and I hope that we will soon move
                away from perpetual testing to perpetual teaching.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In conclusion, I hope that equality and
                social inclusion will remain high on the Government’s agenda.
                The Department of Education and, indeed, the Assembly itself,
                should be proactive in seeking solutions that will redress the
                balance and provide equality of opportunity for the whole
                population.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr Ian Paisley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My remarks concern agriculture. First, the
                draft Programme for Government commits the Executive routinely
                to consider the rural dimension by rural proofing during the
                making and implementation of policy. We do not know what rural
                proofing is. We questioned the Deputy Secretary at the
                Department of Agriculture, and he could not define rural
                proofing. He said that we would have to wait until January 2001
                before the Minister, or anybody, would know what rural proofing
                means. How will the other Departments co-operate with rural
                proofing when even the Department responsible for it does not
                know what it means? This causes great concern to members of the
                Agriculture Committee and to me as its Chairperson. We believe
                that proper rural proofing is necessary and that steps should be
                taken right across the board which should benefit those living
                in rural districts and especially the farming community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are also concerned about the programme to
                modernise and diversify the structure of farming, yet we are
                amazed that there are no action points listed on how this is to
                be achieved. We need to know the steps proposed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We know that neither the Minister herself nor
                the Department is eager to bring in a pension scheme for farmers
                and that that may not happen. What about new people coming into
                farming? Is it not possible for those who have served their time
                in farming to see new people entering with certain advantages so
                that those older people can retire? Why is the United Kingdom
                not to have a pension for farmers, as other parts of the
                European Union do, and especially for those who are in dire
                straits because of debts which resulted mainly from the BSE
                crisis and the tragedy in our pig industry. I hope the Minister
                will be able to enlighten us, because those issues lie right at
                the heart of this matter, and they need to be addressed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that by January the Minister and her
                Department will be able to give us a clear definition of rural
                development and that they will give us to understand how she
                will communicate the usefulness of rural development to every
                other Department. That is going to be a big business. Sir Reg&nbsp;Empey
                is sitting in the Chamber, and I am sure that he has some views
                on the matter. He ought to have views because of his
                responsibility for industry in rural districts. We need to have
                information on that big issue so that the next time we debate
                the matter it will not be in the dark but in the full light of
                candid definition.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McElduff:</p>

                seo.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I must begin by commending the inclusive
                approach adopted by the Executive in drafting the Programme for
                Government. At its root is the imperative of eliminating the
                democratic deficit which pre-dated partition and has
                characterised the history of the Six-County state since its
                inception in the early 1920s. However, I share the frustration
                of others who have addressed the debate on the dishonest tactics
                of the First Minister in plotting the collapse of the political
                institutions, while most other Ministers were dotting every i
                and crossing every t in the Programme for Government. That lends
                an air of unreality to the programme and instils public
                scepticism; it is regrettable insofar as it flies in the face of
                the notion of a shared vision.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As to the content of the programme — yes,
                it is aspirational; yes, it is ambitious in some regards; and
                no, it is not nearly radical enough.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a member of the Education Committee I am
                pleased to note that investment in education and skills has been
                identified as one of the five Executive priorities. It is only
                right that education should enjoy, and continue to enjoy, such
                priority. The Ministers, Mr&nbsp;McGuinness and Dr&nbsp;Farren,
                deserve commendation for their efforts and future support in
                sustaining this type of agenda.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the general commitments to raising
                educational standards for all, cherishing each child equally. I
                also welcome the commitment to seriously address the issues of
                low and underachievement. Underachievement is a specific area
                for North/South focus and co-operation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The document highlights the central role of
                education in securing an inclusive society and a strong and
                vibrant economy and in promoting lifelong learning and healthier
                lives for everyone.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Ms Lewsley pointed out, the programme
                invites ongoing redefinition of our educational objectives. We
                have heard of the three &quot;Rs&quot;; now the &quot;Ens&quot;
                are coming into the debate — encouragement; enjoyment;
                enlightenment and enthusiasm. I welcome the swing away from
                solely academic achievement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Specifically, I welcome the commitment to
                implementing new viability criteria to help promote Irish-
                medium education by the year 2001. That sector has suffered
                neglect for years, decades and centuries. The Irish language was
                officially frowned upon in our education system, and it is time
                for it to take its rightful place. I await the outcome of the
                consultation on education through the medium of Irish. People in
                the cities, towns and villages are also awaiting that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Similarly, the objective of expanding and
                enriching pre-school provision to benefit every child for at
                least one year is extremely important. The deadline of June 2001
                has been set for the completion of the review of post-primary
                education. It is timely to speak about that matter now, as our
                young people sat the first section of the 11-plus examination
                last Friday, and the second section will take place on 24
                November. I hope that those children are among the last to
                undergo the 11-plus, which has been very damaging.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, the emphasis on education as the
                engine for the economy is very pertinent. We need to help equip
                our young people with the skills and qualifications they need to
                take their place in the modern economy. I recently spoke to an
                official from the Sligo County Enterprise Board who told me that
                that was a key ingredient of the Celtic tiger. Similarly, I
                welcome the emphasis on knowledge-based economy. Let us hope the
                Celtic tiger gets his paws wet in the North soon.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Speaker. It concerns
                the application of the equality principle to your selection of
                parties and their speaking order. In calling Mrs&nbsp;Bell to
                speak, you will have called 50% of the Alliance Party. It seems
                to me that at this stage, by the same token, we should have
                heard from a dozen Members of my party and the SDLP, 10 from the
                DUP and nine from Sinn Féin.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order. Mr Leslie ought to know that on a
                point of order it is not open to him to question the Speaker
                about such matters on the Floor of the House. If he wishes to do
                so in the proper manner, he is entirely free to do so, but it is
                not in order for him to raise a question of that kind here.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs E Bell:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have to say, Mr Speaker, that we have
                quality — perhaps not quantity but quality.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I note the draft Programme for Government
                with some disappointment. The title of the introduction, ‘Making
                a Difference’, would be more credible if there really had been
                an attempt to get away from the dangerously traditional,
                two-communities concept. I also hoped that the parties which are
                not in the Executive could have had more direct input, other
                than as members of Committees, but perhaps that will come.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, I totally agree that we need
                significantly to improve the educational successes of so many of
                our young people. It is also encouraging that the need for an
                holistic perspective on education involving a number of
                Departments has been recognised — although someone should talk
                to the Minister for Social Development who appears reluctant to
                work with the Health and Education Departments on the effects,
                for example, of social disadvantage on children. Targeting
                social need is a matter for all Departments, and there must be
                joined-up Government on such issues.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am glad that education is included
                throughout the draft programme and involves different
                Departments. I hope that all Departments will take note. I can
                only hope that investing in education and skills will take a
                high priority, given that there are other competing policy
                issues. In the long term, society will benefit only if there is
                a vibrant, efficient, accessible and affordable education sector
                for people from early years to adulthood, and for some time
                beyond. It is to be welcomed that pre-school education has been
                expanded so that, by 2003, every child will have one year of
                pre-school education. This is another very important part of our
                education sector.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The 11-plus — or selection — review must
                be comprehensive so that real and informed decisions can be
                made. As one who sat, or attempted to sit, an 11-plus exam last
                week, I have nothing but admiration for those children who have
                done it. I would like it to be scrapped as soon as possible,
                because I would not want to do it again.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other actions promised, such as tackling
                disruptive behaviour and bullying, and information and
                communications technology training will also help to improve the
                situation in the education sector. Improving access to all
                levels of education will also need realistic and effective
                decisions taken regarding such things as student fees and loans.
                I also suggest that in this series of actions, the equality
                priority should cause the viability criteria for integrated and
                Irish-medium education to be reconsidered. I know that a Member
                who spoke earlier has welcomed the viability criteria
                consultation, and it is right that Irish- medium education
                should be included. However, in the existing consultation
                criteria for integrated education, there is talk about the
                religious determination, which openly discriminates — <i>[Interruption]</i></p>

                being distracted by those on my left.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the criteria for integrated education in
                the consultation document, the religious determination that each
                school needs in order to qualify is mentioned. That
                discriminates openly against children and parents who, quite
                properly, do not wish to be labelled as one or the other. It is
                regrettable, but integrated education is barely mentioned, as is
                Irish-medium education. I hope that will be rectified once the
                criteria are agreed on.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I note that children with special educational
                and/or physical difficulties get only a scant mention. In fact,
                the document does not refer in any great detail to children
                generally. Therefore I call once again for a children’s
                commissioner so that education and other areas to do with
                children are given priority. I would be pleased if the Children’s
                Fund that has recently been set up were increased to allow for
                basic literacy and numeracy teaching in primary schools and at
                other levels in education.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is also essential that the number of
                university places in Northern Ireland be increased, possibly
                aided by a degree of financial input from the private sector.
                That has already started, but I hope that it continues, and
                continues well, so that all stages of the education process —
                academic and vocational — can flow freely with young people
                acquiring the skills and qualifications needed to realise their
                potential. A good pre-school education, effective primary school
                conditions and a second-level system that caters for all pupils
                are desirable.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Douglas:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to address specifically section 5 of
                the Executive’s Programme for Government. First, I welcome the
                proposals for public transport and for the maintenance and
                renewal of roads. Telecommunications are vital for a vibrant
                economy, both rural and urban, but transport and the
                telecommunications infrastructure must be balanced to deliver
                efficiently the extra product gained through improved
                telecommunication links.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must improve the rail network to carry
                more of our output from the Province. That would increase access
                to markets and help reduce, if not minimise, the amount of large
                trucks on our roads. They contribute greatly to polluting the
                air and to congestion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am glad to see that the work on the road
                network, as a result of the Chancellor’s announcement in 1998,
                is to begin. Those projects, which include the improvement of
                single and dual carriageways, are necessary to provide efficient
                links throughout the Province. I come from the north-west and I
                appreciate greatly, as will my Colleagues from the area, the
                fact that the proposed Toome bypass is underway and on course
                for completion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This will expedite trade and travel on the
                Londonderry to Belfast route that are so vital at present for
                workers and traders in the north-west. I also welcome the
                consideration being given to new funding sources. We must
                encourage private-public partnerships with appropriate
                regulation to ensure that the taxpayers and consumers get the
                best value. Private concerns can often run the business of
                government better, as privatisation in recent years has
                demonstrated. However, we must always ensure that concerns are
                properly and adequately policed so that they do not become
                private monopolies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The next references are to energy
                infrastructure. Although, as the programme states, our energy
                market is relatively small, we need to improve access to various
                energy sources for the more remote areas of the Province. People
                in rural areas are restricted almost exclusively to oil and
                electricity to meet their energy needs, and both are rapidly
                rising in price. The oil costs — and the Assembly has already
                debated this — are extraordinary and have a knock-on effect on
                electricity prices.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A north-west gas pipeline would benefit
                greatly the main towns of Coleraine and Limavady in my
                constituency. It would offer more choice, flexibility and, it is
                to be hoped, cost savings to both the domestic and business
                consumers who could avail of the development. It would also help
                with inward investment in the north-west, as energy needs can
                take up a large element of the cost base of intensive business.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the aim to eliminate the backlog of
                planning applications. Planning problems are a sore point with
                many constituents, and shortening the backlog will be of help.
                However, while I welcome this development of long-term planning
                strategies, we should make the Planning Service more open, and
                more acceptable, to the general public.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The initiation of a process to prepare a
                regional planning policy statement for the countryside in
                2001-02 must be expedited, as many rural areas are becoming
                denuded of their inhabitants as a result of planning
                applications being refused. Many farmers’ sons cannot build a
                modest house on their farm because of planning regulations,
                while others can build in exposed areas, almost willy-nilly,
                with the blessing of the planners. Where is the sense in that?
                The Programme for Government wishes to keep farmers in rural
                areas, but no one helps drive them out more than the planners.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, I want to address the issues of
                rural regeneration and tourism. I welcome the policy of rural
                proofing because the rural community has often been neglected as
                far as development is concerned. We need to support rural
                dwellers, including farmers, in addressing the economic and
                social problems that are encountered.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Indeed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to say something about the economic
                growth section of the programme, but I first want to comment on
                remarks made earlier by Mr&nbsp;Peter&nbsp;Robinson about
                cross-border bodies and the North/South apparatus generally. To
                summarise, he said that much of the content was rather woolly
                and imprecise. He is entirely correct. He could have added that
                they are full of contradictions and contain aspirations,
                particularly on matters of competition. Common sense would tell
                people that these cannot be delivered in practice. That is the
                way I want my cross-border bodies. They may have political value
                in certain quarters, but they do not have any constitutional
                significance, and they have little practical application. Long
                may it remain that way.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Looking at the economic growth section I am a
                little concerned by the rather nannying tone of some of the
                suggestions. As Northern Ireland is already over-administered,
                we must be exceedingly wary of increasing work by creating more
                administration. Essentially, the business environment thrives
                best with the minimum of regulation. There are many examples of
                that around the world. The business community often says that
                the zeal with which the United Kingdom implements all the
                Directives that it receives from Brussels is somewhat in excess
                of that of our European partners. We need to be exceedingly
                conscious of this and be careful to limit our zeal. I
                particularly noticed that one of the provisions was to encourage
                businesses to become more competitive by learning from
                consumers. A business that does not constantly learn from its
                consumers has very little prospect of succeeding in the
                competitive world. We must be careful about making statements of
                this kind when they should be well understood already.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and
                Investment has frequently said that you cannot dictate to
                businesses where they should set up. You might attempt to use a
                light guiding hand, but that is the most that you can do. If the
                Government cannot bring jobs to the people, which I do not
                believe they can, they must take adequate measures to ensure
                that people can get to the jobs, and their transport policy
                should reflect this.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I note that among the provisions for the
                cross-border bodies there is provision for</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Consideration of proposals and of

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not think this is the case.
                Competitiveness takes place between the two economies and
                between these economies and any other economy with which one
                might be attempting to trade. That competition is entirely
                healthy so any differences between neighbouring regimes are
                welcome, because what is good in one place may be bad in
                another. We should bear this in mind.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All the emphasis in tourism tends to be on
                the marketing of Northern Ireland, or of all of Ireland, to the
                outside world. I am concerned that we have not placed enough
                emphasis on the internal marketing of our product, and I am
                concerned that this is not addressed in the document. It is one
                thing to attract visitors here, but it is another to give them a
                good time when they arrive. We need to ensure that their
                attention is drawn to every facility that might be attractive to
                them. The same applies to our own population. Tourist
                attractions in Northern Ireland are not well known to many of
                those working here. I hope the Minister will address that
                matter.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Byrne:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Programme for Government, and I
                pay tribute to the Ministers who assembled it. It is an
                important vision statement for the future of Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to discuss the physical
                infrastructure, and I welcome, in particular, the five Executive
                programme funds. Adequate investment in the physical
                infrastructure is necessary for economic development in Northern
                Ireland. Those of us who live many miles outside Belfast have
                for many years accepted our social and economic disadvantages,
                as there has been inadequate investment in physical
                infrastructure across the region.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those who want balanced regional economic
                development want the Government to take the lead in securing a
                fair and equitable distribution of resources throughout. The
                implementation of a balanced regional development strategy
                across the North, as a means of regenerating the economy, is a
                core SDLP policy. My party recognises that uneven development
                has exacerbated social exclusion in this area, adding to the
                political instability which has held this society back for too
                long. For the first time we have devolved power, and we now have
                the opportunity to reverse political instability and make, in
                the words of the Programme for Government, &quot;a real
                difference to the lives of the people of this region.&quot;</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This responsibility should not be taken
                lightly. I commend the Executive for creating an infrastructure/
                capital renewal programme fund to address the underinvestment in
                our road, rail, sewerage and water networks and develop our
                energy market and telecommunication systems. The intention to
                produce a ten-year transportation strategy and to bring a Bill
                on transport before the Assembly should ensure that the North
                will have a truly integrated transportation system, which will
                achieve the correct balance between public and private, road and
                rail.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Resources are limited, so I am pleased to
                read that the Executive will be exploring alternative means of
                financing new projects in the form of public-private
                partnerships. The people of this region have suffered for too
                long on account of the poor condition of our roads and
                restricted access to public transport. We should not be shy
                about taking advantage of the benefits which private finance can
                bring to our transport system. With particular reference to the
                rural areas of Northern Ireland, the announcement that work will
                soon begin on a number of strategic route improvement schemes
                and on the plan to operate 15 rural community transport
                partnerships will help to rectify the transport deficit in rural
                areas, enhance safety and enable regional towns to maximise
                their economic potential. My constituency has three of the most
                deprived council wards in Northern Ireland. West Tyrone has not
                received its fair share of new inward investment projects. I
                therefore welcome the Executive’s aim of attracting 75% of all
                new first-time inward investment projects to such areas of
                disadvantage.</p>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive could further demonstrate their
                confidence in areas of high unemployment by initiating a wide-
                ranging policy of administrative decentralisation. A programme
                for Civil Service decentralisation could be drawn up and
                implemented over a five-year period, relocating entire sections
                or subsections of Government Departments to the major or key
                service centres identified by the Department for Regional
                Development’s strategic framework document ‘Shaping Our
                Future’ as local engines of economic growth. Such a policy has
                successfully operated in the Republic.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The measures that will be taken to create a
                more co-ordinated and efficient planning process are also very
                welcome. For several years there has been a backlog of planning
                applications, and planning regulations have been too
                restrictive, especially in rural areas. The Executive’s
                intention to issue a series of regional planning policy
                statements to make planning policy more flexible will form an
                important component of an overall regional development strategy
                and should strike a balance between our economic and
                infrastructure needs and our environmental concerns. I agree
                with the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment’s
                earlier reference to the importance of small- medium-sized
                enterprises.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All that has been said in the debate by those
                Members whose parties are in the Executive Committee of the
                House — and indeed all that is in the 200 proposals contained
                in the 87 pages of this report — is nothing more than flannel.
                The report in total disguises the essential nakedness of this
                Administration. It has no serious proposals which it can bring
                before the House and have implemented in a serious fashion. In
                fact, it attempts to disguise this lack by embellishing the
                report with a great number of clichés. Indeed, this report is
                not a Programme for Government, but a book of clichés and
                well-meaning phrases. It is a book from a Government that will
                not actually achieve anything. It is a Government that says much
                but does very little.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This Administration — if I am generous to
                it — has allowed its ambition to get in the way of the
                political realities with which it is faced. We shall find that
                this Programme for Government, to which we shall return time and
                time again in the lifetime of this Executive, contains very few
                substantial proposals that have been implemented.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Mallon, in his opening comments in this
                debate, paid tribute to the North/South Ministerial Council.
                Clearly those compliments do not extend as far as the First
                Minister, given the fact that, according to some of his friends,
                he has tried to scupper the operation of those council meetings.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Leslie, who spoke a few moments ago, will
                find at page 55 in the very extensive chapter on developing
                North/South relationships that we are not going to get the
                benign and inoffensive North/South bodies that he seems to want.
                Mr Leslie’s desire to have largely inactive bodies will not be
                achieved. He will see that if he reads page 55 of the report,
                which says that the plan is to</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member knows that I do not have time. The
                intention of this report is to act, not to be benign and
                inoffensive and not have all-Ireland action. It is to establish
                an all-Ireland, cross-border, governmental authority in Northern
                Ireland. Indeed, Mrs&nbsp;Carson talked about sustainability and
                made great play of this, as did the Leader of Sinn&nbsp;Féin/IRA
                in a dance of mutual respect. They where both talking about
                sustainability — we will sustain this if you sustain that. I
                checked the meaning of the word &quot;sustain&quot;, and it
                means &quot;to support, to bear the weight of over a long
                period, to give strength to and encourage&quot;. There is no
                doubt about it: this all-Ireland programme sustains Provisional
                IRA murder men in the Government of Northern Ireland. That is
                the reality of this report, and people ought not to lose sight
                of it. It sustains them. Is the Ulster Unionist Party going to
                continue to sustain those people in Government? We will find out
                soon enough.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Carson welcomed the report. However,
                during the course of her contribution she listed at least
                20&nbsp;objections. If that was a welcome, I would hate to see
                her attack something she disagrees with.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should object to this agenda because it
                contains nothing to deal with the specific issues that we raised
                in the various Committees. There is nothing in this report that
                will eradicate farm debt. How will the ordinary person, trying
                to develop his or her farm, know what rural proofing means, how
                it will operate and where the mechanics are for it? It contains
                nothing for a farm- restructuring scheme, and that disappoints
                me. The only way we can inject new life into this industry is to
                have a new farm retirement scheme that will allow new blood in
                and new measures to apply.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, I want to turn to the introduction to
                the section ‘Securing a Competitive Economy’, which refers
                to the achievement of a cohesive, inclusive and just society
                that places communities at its centre. It states that the
                creation of a vibrant economy, producing employment and wealth
                for the future, is essential. This is a laudable and worthy
                objective, yet it appears that it is mere rhetoric. When we turn
                to the equality aspects in annex&nbsp;B, under section&nbsp;6 we
                are told that economic development may not initially benefit all
                equally. Why? Is this an admission of failure before we even

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Are the Executive and the Department of
                Enterprise, Trade and Investment telling us that they are not
                going to meet their statutory equality obligations? This is not
                good enough. Targeting social need (TSN) has been in place since
                1990. It is about time we all started taking it seriously.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Earlier my Colleague John&nbsp;Kelly pointed
                to the legitimate public concerns about private finance
                initiatives (PFI) and privatisation. Turning to the plans for
                the development of the rail system and the proposed Transport
                Bill, I would also urge caution. Privatisation, whether under
                PFIs or public-private partnerships (PPPs), of essential public
                services is a major policy change which will have a long-term
                and, I would argue, adverse impact on the public sector. It is a
                case of &quot;Buy now, pay dearly later&quot;. It is not
                acceptable that the Programme for Government should present
                privatisation as a fait accompli without any debate,
                consultation or investigation into the efficacy or otherwise of
                such a drastic policy change. It is time we had a debate about
                PFI, privatisation, PPPs and so forth.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Section 5.3.2 on the role of inward

                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;A challenge will be to change
                international perceptions to ensure that we can be a competitive
                location for investment and to ensure sufficient investment in
                areas of disadvantage and high unemployment. We will aim to
                attract 75% of all first time inward investment projects to such
                areas.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This has been the stated aim of the IDB for
                several years, and it has manifestly failed, through lack of
                political will, poor marketing strategies, a failure to work
                with people from disadvantaged areas and the failure to plan
                strategically for inward investment. The Programme for
                Government fails to acknowledge the important role of agencies
                such as the IDB in redressing years of religious discrimination.
                The equality agenda has to be applied to the role of the IDB and
                an end put to its practice of inflating the numbers of jobs
                promised and of actual jobs created. In this regard, it is a
                matter of major concern that the IDB is not subject to statutory
                equality duties under section 75.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are also told in annex B, paragraph 6.5,
                that there is no power to direct investors to specific
                locations. There has been power here for generations to direct
                investors and business to specific locations, to the
                disadvantage and detriment of one community. It is about time we
                began to take our equality provisions seriously. Instead of
                paying lip-service to equality, we should be putting these
                provisions in place to lift areas up that have been
                disadvantaged through structural discrimination. Therefore I
                welcome the provisions under paragraph 5.3.1 to re-structure the
                economic development agencies, because it has been recognised
                for some time that there were major problems — particularly
                within the IDB. As an all-Ireland party, our preference is the
                creation of a single development agency on the island of
                Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, whatever structures are eventually
                put in place — whether there are single agencies or
                multi-agencies — it is essential that an ethos of openness,
                transparency and accountability is put in place. It is time that
                TSN and our statutory equality duties were taken seriously and
                placed at the heart of the Department’s policy and that a
                close relationship was built up with the IDA and Enterprise
                Ireland. In that way we could enjoy economic co-operation on an
                all-Ireland scale instead of indulging in wasteful
                competitiveness. Go raibh maith agat.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome this programme for two main
                reasons. First, there will be an advance in transparency of
                government which will become more apparent when we get access to
                the public service agreements for inspection and scrutiny.
                Secondly, I commend the promotion of cross-cutting
                interdepartmental co-operation in Government. Thus the key
                elements of the document run across the 11 Departments. I also
                welcome the Executive’s programme funds, though there are some
                questions about who will scrutinise their devising and
                application.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Chapter 4, which deals with investment,
                education and skills, is a good example of cross-cutting in
                Government in that it provides for co-operation between the
                Department of Higher and Further Education, Training and
                Employment and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and
                Investment and also between the Department of Culture, Arts and
                Leisure and the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development.
                The Higher and Further Education, Training and Employment
                Committee fully supports the aspirations outlined in chapter 4.
                Why? This is because human capital, in other words education and
                training, is now widely recognised as a key component of
                economic growth.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must try to address what may be the
                central problem of the Northern Ireland economy: low pay.
                Relative to the rest of the United Kingdom and to much of
                north-west Europe, output and employment have grown impressively
                here over the last decade, but wages have declined. Low pay is
                better than no pay, but high pay is better still. Therefore we
                need to work on these aspirations in chapter 4 of the document.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is also the question of skill
                shortages. They may not be evident at the moment in a static
                sense, but they would probably become very pressing in sectors
                such as tourism, financial services, and information technology,
                if the economy were to grow as rapidly as we fervently hope it
                will.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the light of those considerations, I doubt
                that the targets and aspirations contained in chapter 4 go far
                enough. I share the reservations of John Simpson, expressed in
                an article in the ‘Business Telegraph’ on 7 November 2000:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Are the further and higher education
                and vocational training targets high enough given the changing
                state of the market for skilled people?&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For example, are 200 higher education places
                enough, given the much higher number of places available in
                Scotland on a per capita basis, or the thousands of often
                unwilling student exiles this Province produces every year? The
                argument that 200 extra places are not enough can still be made,
                even after the Minister’s previous announcement of 4,200
                places for 1999-2004. Given this background, the 5,000% increase
                in attainment levels in further education may also be too
                modest.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In conclusion, I welcome the outward-looking
                orientation of the document. Incidentally, the objective on
                chapter 4, page 40, relating to increased university lecturer
                exchanges between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland
                should appropriately be widened to include exchanges with the
                rest of the United Kingdom and the rest of the world.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Commendably, the programme often emphasises
                accountability. My Committee would like to see more specific
                mention of the roles of Assembly Committees in this regard, for
                example, in paragraph 7·1. The Higher and Further Education,
                Training and Employment Committee has already provided the
                Finance Committee and the Minister with several dozen detailed
                comments on the text of this milestone document. It is a
                document that should help devolution to endure and work to the
                benefit of all the people of Northern Ireland.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr A Maginness:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Programme for Government. The
                production of this substantial document is evidence of the hard
                work that the Executive have undertaken in order to produce a
                programme for the good of the whole community in Northern
                Ireland. It demonstrates the value of having a devolved
                Administration and the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was surprised to hear some Members,
                particular Ian Paisley Jnr, describe this document as
                insubstantial flannel. One could not get a more substantial
                document than this. It really is a great credit to the
                Administration that they have produced such a substantial
                document. Mr Paisley Jnr should look at the document again,
                especially the part relating to infrastructure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He should look at the section on regional
                development, because he included all the Departments in his
                criticism. The regional development section talks about the
                production, by summer 2001, of a 10-year regional transportation
                strategy that will consider new funding sources. It provides for
                a strategy, from the spring of 2001, to tackle the historical
                underinvestment in Northern Ireland’s rail services, and, from
                2001, an initiative to assist Translink to replace its buses and
                coaches after 18 and 12 years of service respectively. By the
                spring of 2002, the Belfast metropolitan transport plan will be
                completed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first tranche of legislative proposals
                for trust ports will be put forward in early 2001. Further work
                on a number of strategic route improvement schemes, a Railways
                Safety Bill and a Transport Bill are proposed. Fifteen rural
                community transport partnerships will be put into operation by
                2001. These all fall under the remit of the Department for
                Regional Development — a DUP Department, so to speak. That
                shows how bankrupt the Member and his party have been in
                critically assessing this document. This is a substantial
                document that addresses the historical underfunding and
                underdevelopment of Northern Ireland’s infrastructure, and it
                places the whole problem of the underdevelopment of
                infrastructure within the context of creating a competitive
                economy in Northern Ireland. That is what we all have to do —
                create a vibrant economy, and by doing that we will create a
                situation in which the whole community benefits from the
                progress made.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We cannot develop a modern, competitive
                economy if we have Victorian infrastructure. Of course,
                recognising that problem is not sufficient — we have to apply
                our minds to remedying those deficiencies by developing
                alternative methods of funding in relation to our public
                programmes and to our infrastructure in particular.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is not fair or right for Dara O’Hagan to
                say that we should have a debate on public-private partnerships
                and private finance initatives. We have to look at all the
                options, because we do not have sufficient funds under the
                Barnett Formula to develop our infrastructure. If we do not
                develop our infrastructure, we do not develop our economy.
                Therefore, it is unfair for the Member to come to the House and
                say that she does not want PPPs or PFIs. We have to look at all
                the options. We may reject some of them, but, nonetheless, we
                have to look at them all.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is essential to develop a modern water
                system — for our environment, for public health, and for
                industry. It is also essential for industry and for people
                generally that we develop a modern transportation system in
                Northern Ireland. It is also important that we develop our ports
                to maximum business efficiency, and that is what the document
                sets out to do.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have listened with interest to the various
                contributions, and I still cannot help but think that this is a
                matter of rearranging the deckchairs on the Titanic. The
                Programme for Government does not address who should be in the
                Government in the first place. The Government are devising a
                programme with people in power who have tortured this community.
                We still have two Departments with terrorists in Government.

                what precisely is said and whether there are specific
                accusations about specific Members, for that would not be in

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I suspect that I will not for one moment be
                withdrawing that last comment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The programme does not address that
                fundamental problem. The ordinary, decent people of the Province
                will never accept, in the Government of their country, an
                Executive that includes people who are out and out supporters of
                — and in a previous life were — active terrorists. That is
                simply unacceptable. That is the rock on which the whole process
                will ultimately fail.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">By all means, it is good to have an academic
                debate on the Programme for Government, but at the next election
                the people will clearly destroy this Government, and quite
                rightly so. As a party, we are dedicated to the overthrow of any
                system that allows terrorists into the Government of the
                Province.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, there are one or two issues that
                should be highlighted. An issue that I am very concerned about
                and which, unfortunately, obviously there is going to be no
                movement on, is the early retirement scheme for farmers. There
                are 28,000 full-time farmers in the Province. Many of them are
                trapped in the industry; they cannot get out because they are
                over 50 years old, but below retirement age. There is no scheme
                which would enable them to enjoy some form of retirement, to get
                out of the industry and receive a decent income. Until we
                address that fundamental problem in the overall structure of the
                agriculture industry, we will not solve the problems of the
                Province’s farming sector. This is one of the rare occasions
                on which the Minister cannot say that she is bound by EU
                regulations. Not only do EU regulations permit such an idea, but
                it has been successfully implemented in countries such as
                France. That is a crucial point that should have been, but was
                not, addressed in the programme.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am particularly interested in the
                environment and in regional development. There is some reference
                to private finance initiatives and public-private partnerships
                in the Programme for Government. However, more emphasis should
                have been placed on finding alternative funding for the enormous
                problems faced by the Department for Regional Development. The
                Water Service requires £3 billion to be spent on water over the
                next 30 years. The Roads Service requires £2 billion to be
                spent over 10 years. Regardless of what Dr O’Hagan or anyone
                else in Sinn Féin says, the Assembly will never have sufficient
                money to meet the needs which exist under the present budgetary
                constraints. It will not happen.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I share the feelings of those who are
                concerned about privatisation. I am sure that most Members would
                oppose any moves to privatise the Water Service, for instance.
                However, between the present budgetary arrangements and
                privatisation, we have to explore every possible angle and
                create a funding package with which to overcome the huge lack of
                investment in infrastructure in the Province.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">May I be parochial and say that there are
                many towns in the Province that are still being strangled by
                congestion. It would be remiss of me not to mention Ballynahinch,
                which desperately needs a by-pass. There are one or two towns in
                every constituency where a relatively small amount of investment
                would relieve congestion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the emphasis on public transport.
                We have turned the tide on that, and the £102 million package
                for railway investment is to be welcomed. However, that only
                takes us up to the end of year three, and many people will be
                asking what will happen after that with regard to funding.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Therefore, some aspects of the Programme are
                welcome but, in others, opportunities have been missed. However,
                that does not solve the ultimate problem facing the Province.</p>

                The Programme for Government represents a consensus between
                parties who do not often agree but quite often disagree on
                political aspirations and social and economic analysis. It is
                not a radical document, but a radical departure was not an
                option, given the limited devolution and severely prescribed
                control of finance that exists. However, the Programme for
                Government contains some innovative and creative ideas, which
                are very welcome. It is churlish not to recognise that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In some respects, it is an indication of the
                benefits and effects of bringing local expertise and
                accountability to bear. However, we cannot ignore the impact of
                the subsequent actions of the First Minister. Regardless of how
                reality is presented or dolled-up, the programme was presented
                on Monday 23 October — and it was generally welcomed by the
                people of the Six Counties — but by 28 October, five days
                later, there was a programme for the destruction of government.
                Both programmes were presented by the same person. That has in
                many ways affected this lacklustre debate. There is an air of
                unreality.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Public confidence in the ability of the
                Executive and the Assembly to rise above party interest has been

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the start of today’s debate,
                David&nbsp;Trimble said that the Draft Programme for Government
                was arguably the most important business that the Assembly had
                transacted since it came into existence. He said that that might
                strike some as a bold assertion — I can think of a more
                accurate description. He went on to say that the debate
                represented the beginning of the maturity of the new politics of
                the agreement. Which agreement is he talking about? He always
                seems to be referring to a different document from the rest of
                us. That is at the heart of the difficulties that we have
                experienced.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In his statement, David&nbsp;Trimble set out
                his objectives:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;to deliver a new beginning for
                Government … Government which is responsive to the community
                that it serves and which is in tune with the people by whom it
                has been elected&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those are grand sentiments. He said that it
                would be a Government that would</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;seek to provide new and better public
                services and new and better opportunities for the community as a
                whole—Protestant and Catholic and those of other religions and
                none, Unionist, Nationalist, Republican and those of no
                particular political conviction, male and female, the young as
                well as the elderly, those of British or Irish descent and those
                who have only more recently come to live among us&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It would be encouraging if that were
                supported with integrity and consistency. We listen to
                David&nbsp;Trimble and weep, as we reflect on the reality.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We face the most serious crisis yet in the
                peace process. It has been engineered by David&nbsp;Trimble and
                the unelected, unrepresentative Ulster Unionist Council. Genuine
                supporters of the Good Friday Agreement have been disappointed
                by the British Government’s failure to establish clear blue
                water between their position and the position adopted by the
                Ulster Unionist Council and the First Minister. It is not good
                enough for Peter Mandelson to say that he will not endorse what
                David&nbsp;Trimble says—we did not ask him to endorse it, and,
                to my knowledge, no one else did. It is not good enough for
                Peter Mandelson to say that he does not have the power to force
                David&nbsp;Trimble to sign a piece of paper—nobody asked him
                to adopt those powers and nobody argued that he had those
                powers. However, the British Government have a responsibility
                under the terms of the international treaty that they signed,
                and under the terms of the agreement, to protect the integrity
                of the agreement. So far, they have failed to do so.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The agreement stipulates that if the
                North/South Ministerial Council does not function as prescribed,
                the Assembly will fall, because of their interdependence. That
                is the specifically stated, intended result of the UUP’s
                strategy. David&nbsp;Trimble set out his aims in his letter of
                26 October — create a crisis, force a suspension and blame
                Republicans. That is in writing. David&nbsp;Trimble set out a
                six-point plan to achieve that: disrupting the functioning of

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I broadly welcome the Programme for
                Government. The fact that we have a Programme for Government at
                all is testament to the solid and sustained progress that has
                been made. That progress has not been widely enough realised in
                the community, and we will have to address that issue. There is
                much for which to commend the Programme for Government and much
                to commend in the specific measures relating to the work of the
                Department of Agriculture and Rural Development. I have a
                particular interest in those matters and hold a remit from my
                party on them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No one can fault the commitment to improve
                the quality of Northern&nbsp;Ireland’s agricultural produce.
                Northern Ireland already has a good and well-deserved
                reputation, and any steps to reinforce and maintain those high
                standards must be welcomed. That reputation for quality
                underpins the commercial success of the agri- food industry at
                home and in the export markets.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the proposals and the targets for
                the number of clean cattle given E, U and R&nbsp;grades. My
                concerns about the Programme for Government’s measures for
                agriculture and rural development are not about what it says,
                but about what it does not say. I am concerned about what is not
                contained in the programme — the sins of omission, not the
                sins of commission. To say that agriculture is in crisis is an
                understatement — every schoolchild knows that. One blow has
                followed another and there are real and pressing issues to be
                tackled.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The agriculture department in any country is
                required to look to producers and consumers. The emphasis in the
                Programme for Government, while it rightly addresses consumer
                concerns here and abroad, does not favour producers and its
                comments in section 5.3.4 relating to producers are rather
                sparse. I agree that producers cannot thrive if consumers are
                not happy. I agree that it is in everybody’s interests to
                secure product quality, and I agree that we have a reputation to
                maintain in that regard, as we have been at the cutting edge in
                food production and have shown the rest of Europe the way ahead.
                A case in point would be our tracking system for beef products
                in the context of the BSE crisis now beginning to ravage our
                partners in France.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the crisis in agriculture does not
                rest with consumers, either primary consumers in the agri-food
                industry or secondary consumers, the customers in the shops or
                supermarkets: it lies with the farmers, as producers. The issues
                threatening to destroy agriculture are farm incomes and farmgate
                prices. Destroy the farmers and the whole edifice of the agri-food
                industry that rests on them will also be destroyed. Yet, I do
                not see, in the Programme for Government, any direct measures to
                alleviate the profoundly serious situation in which farmers find
                themselves.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At best, product quality measures will have
                only an indirect and long-term impact on the viability of
                farming as a livelihood. &quot;Rural development&quot; is no
                afterthought in the title of the Department of Agriculture and
                Rural Development — it is not just something tagged on to the
                end. Rural development — in this age of declining farm
                incomes, and when, because of the common agricultural policy,
                land is being taken out of production — is a critical part of
                the rural economy. It could be the means by which farmers’
                heads are kept above the economic welfare waterline. Indeed at
                section 5.1.3, the Programme for Government specifically states
                that the Executive will seek to promote other sources of income
                generation in the rural economy. But that must be more than
                words, it must be action, and action now. &quot;Rural
                development&quot; was not an afterthought. Farmers are
                diversifying into other businesses, such as agri-tourism, but
                they need time, encouragement, and most of all they need
                backing.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dallat:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the Programme for Government. This
                is a very important day for me. It is the first time in my
                lifetime that there has been an opportunity to debate such a
                programme. That is, in itself, little short of a miracle given
                our political instability in the past — when we were governed
                by absentee landlords, some of whom did their best, some of whom
                did not care, and all of whom were quite unable to give the
                attention to detail that is now possible. I make no apology for
                talking up this Programme for Government. I certainly will not
                talk it down as others have.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Good Friday Agreement promised equality
                above everything else. However, equality is not a solution in
                itself, especially if inequality is shared by everyone. Many
                groups desperately hope that the Assembly will recognise their
                plight, and I make no apology for singling out the 250,000
                people who have serious literacy and numeracy problems. There
                can be no greater injustice than having people who struggle to
                read and write or cope with simple arithmetic. That must be
                addressed, and there has to be a concentrated effort to find the
                additional resources needed to tackle one of the most
                fundamental rights of any citizen — the right to communicate,
                to understand and be understood.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are many pressures on the education
                sector, but a new start has been made. Lifelong learning is now
                a reality but it is also inadequately funded. Nevertheless, we
                will not rule out any sources of funding. Recently, the Minister
                of Education was involved in a private finance initiative scheme
                with St Genevieve’s school in Belfast, which I support. The
                additional places at local universities are most welcome, but
                thousands of our young people will still have to travel to
                England, Scotland or Wales for their education when it should be
                their fundamental right to be educated at home. The amount of
                extra cash for further education is small — will it be enough
                to train young people in the skills needed to meet the demands
                of modern industry? The Minister has highlighted that sector,
                and his efforts are worthy of our support.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Reference has been made to the crisis in the
                agriculture industry. I want to welcome the 24,000 new training
                places created for farmers — 12,000 for business training and
                12,000 for environmental training. The commitment to developing
                a rural planning policy statement by 2002 is a major step
                forward, which demonstrates that a cross-cutting approach will
                be needed to tackle the real structural problems in the rural
                community. For the first time in 30 years, these and many other
                agricultural issues are back on the agenda. As a member of the
                Agriculture Committee, I will ensure that the Chairperson
                understands the importance of rural proofing to the community
                that I represent.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rural development programmes have played
                their part in the regeneration of small towns and villages, and
                that will continue through the Programme for Government. It is
                no mean feat that, during direct rule and some of the worst
                violence, ordinary people put their ideas together, defied
                hopelessness and transformed many small towns and villages. The
                fight to save our towns and villages is not over. The future of
                our rural post offices is a challenge that must be faced
                shortly, while we must also address many other aspects of the
                infrastructure. Rural development is an important part of the
                Programme for Government, and everything must be done to ensure
                that our rural culture, heritage and economic well-being are
                preserved for this and future generations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The public attaches great importance to
                accountability. They are only too well aware that, during the
                dark days of direct rule, Government accountability was minimal.
                There is now two-way, direct communication with the Comptroller
                and Auditor General, who has demonstrated a willingness to work
                with the Assembly for the greater good of the electorate. The
                Public Accounts Committee has already done excellent work in
                scrutinising expenditure, and I fully support the moves to
                include many semi- state bodies and other providers of public
                services, which currently fall outside the remit of the
                Comptroller and Auditor General. Value for money, accountability
                and the elimination of waste are crucial to the success of the
                Programme for Government. Perhaps the most important factor,
                which will ensure the successful delivery of the programme, is
                the ability of all Members to work together. To date, there has
                been remarkable co-operation across party lines, and the public
                welcomes that because it knows we are making history together,
                despite our reservations, concerns and mistrust.</p>

                programmes that provided real social support through a range of
                training opportunities geared to real life have withered. This
                training included trade skills, household skills and care

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On 24 October we were told by the Deputy
                First Minister that our young people are an &quot;important
                focus of attention&quot; — and so they are — yet all he
                could promise was an extra 500 training places in areas of skill
                shortages. What are these areas of skill shortages? Where are
                these training places going to be provided? I also noted that Mr
                Mallon promised an extra 200 undergraduate places on top of the
                4,200 further and higher education places planned by 2004. Where
                are these 4,400 places to be located? When will they be
                available to students? What student support arrangements will be
                created so that the places can be made available to those who
                need them most?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Higher and Further Education,
                Training and Employment has promised that his student finance
                review will address the needs of part-time and full-time
                students in further and higher education. I am surprised to see
                in the draft budget for 2001-02 that despite the promised
                additional places, no provision has been made for extra funding
                for students. Is this all to be jam for tomorrow?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I call, yet again, for assurances that the
                new student finance arrangements will be working for the next
                academic year. It is a disgrace that every year 35% of all
                Northern Ireland school leavers who go on to university have to
                leave Northern Ireland. It is a disgrace that most of those who
                leave do so unwillingly, because there are simply not enough
                openings for them in Northern Ireland. It is a further disgrace
                that most of those who leave are of one religious persuasion —
                Protestant. How can we allow this to happen when we know that
                most of those who leave to study will not come back? What a
                tragic loss at a time when this battered region needs its young
                people to build a society based on the principles of social
                justice and opportunity for all.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was shocked to learn that graduates working
                in Northern Ireland consistently earn less than others
                throughout the United Kingdom — only 80% of the UK average. I
                am saddened to note that earnings in Northern Ireland are only
                86% of the UK average. Is this Programme for Government going to
                be enough, not only to provide the further and higher education
                places and skills training which existing employers need, but
                also to encourage industry to invest? Will the programme do
                enough to tackle the problems of adult literacy and numeracy
                which have been so well documented?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am disappointed that the monitoring of
                evaluation accountability arrangements gets scant mention in the
                draft programme. The Northern Ireland Assembly, in its plenary
                activities, has an important scrutiny and consultative role
                regarding legislation and policy development, and the Assembly’s
                Committees have explicit legal powers with respect to policy
                development consultation scrutiny. Where are these mentioned?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, what of the role of the Comptroller

                welcome the opportunity to comment on the Programme for
                Government, and I want to detail priorities such as securing a
                competitive economy within the wider global economy. I recognise
                the financial constraints put on this Assembly by the British
                Exchequer as regards proper funding, and I am extremely
                disappointed that the huge British war machine budget,
                accounting for hundreds of millions of pounds, has not been
                redistributed but instead has gone back to the British
                Exchequer. If we are to focus on environmental issues, we must
                do so on an all-Ireland basis. We are a small nation, and in
                respect of environmental issues, no one part of it should be
                disregarded.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must also draw a clear line under many of
                the economic and business developments — the failures of the
                past, North and South, to bring a cross-section of business
                potential to the whole of Ireland. We must also bring benefits
                to those areas and communities throughout the island that are
                most economically marginalised and disadvantaged. You may ask
                what this has to do with the Programme for Government. We are
                supposed to benefit from all-Ireland bodies set up under the
                Good Friday Agreement, but these are the same bodies that the
                First Minister is trying to destroy by putting a block on the
                all-Ireland structures.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a need for business on both sides of
                the border to live up to its wider responsibilities so that it
                can benefit from the economic growth that has occurred in the
                rest of Ireland. A number of topics fall into this category —
                union recognition, profit sharing, adequate wages, better
                working conditions, as well as ensuring that the business
                activities are not harmful to the environment. There must be
                greater co-operation in areas such as roads and rail
                development, electricity, gas, waste management and recycling,
                not to mention telephone communications, infrastructures, the
                harnessing of taxes and a single currency for the whole of the
                island.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must capitalise on all-Ireland bodies by
                forging greater links in economic planning and policy making,
                driven by bottom-up participation. When building the economy
                here in the Six Counties, we must look to the future, and that
                future must recognise cross-border trade. At present, 26% of
                exports from the Six Counties go South, while only 4% of exports
                from the Twenty- Six Counties come North. The two
                Administrations agree that it would be in their mutual interests
                to exchange information on co-ordination and work on trade and
                business development and other related matters, with a view to
                bringing benefit to everyone on the island. This will happen
                only if everyone is ready to play their part. The Programme for
                Government must give the lead. Go raibh míle maith agat.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr McDonnell:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mention was made of the rural economy. All
                too often, I see that rural economy recognised as being
                agriculture, with maybe a bit of tourism thrown in, and a few
                people living out there who commute to the towns and cities.
                However, we may have missed out on a big slice of rural life.
                There is a large rural economy consisting of perhaps small
                businesses; some of them may be only metal bashing, for example,
                but some of that metal bashing turned into major operations such
                as Powerscreen International Ltd in the Dungannon area. There
                are small woodworking operations, firms that deal in concrete
                products and other commodities. For example, Finlays Block
                Making Equipment in Ballygawley and the Quinn Group do business
                all over west Fermanagh and west Cavan. There are also equally
                good opportunities for small-scale food processing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not want to delay unduly, but I want to
                raise those issues. All too often we look at the rural economy
                as being purely agriculture-focused, and it does employ a
                considerable number of people. I get the distinct impression
                that LEDU and other agencies are perhaps not as favourably
                disposed towards these small rural companies as they would be if
                they were in an urban setting.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the general aspects of investment
                in public transport, but there is a need for a major overhaul of
                Translink and its accountability. I am somewhat bemused, if not
                befuddled, by the prospect of coaches being subsidised, which is
                a tour-operating rather than a public- transport issue. I would
                like more information on that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Briefly, I turn again to the question of
                overall government. Improvement and greater efficiency in
                services is mentioned. I emphasise an interest in e-government
                in the modernisation programme. There is an opportunity, as yet
                unrecognised by many and an urgent need for early pilot projects
                across every Department. This was touched on indirectly at
                Question Time. We should not be passive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I could spend some time outlining the
                opportunities in health. It should not take three or four weeks
                for communication between a GP and a hospital to reach its
                destination, but in some cases that happens. It is equally
                difficult to find a patient’s hospital discharge letter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would welcome the opportunity for a pilot
                jobfinder project in the Training and Employment Agency. All too
                often, certainly in the Belfast area, people looking for jobs
                are herded towards Gloucester House. If they could work on an
                interactive programme and personal profile themselves, or create
                a curriculum vitae, the work involved in job placements could be
                reduced by between 50% and 60%. This is not to criticise the
                people who currently deal manually with these matters, but I
                wonder how we can remove some of the more laborious and boring
                administrative aspects. Every project could be worked at by
                every Department. I can only imagine the benefits to farmers if
                some farms were put on an e-government process.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr McDonnell, your time is up.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Kane:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I must begin by saying that the elevation of
                rural issues is a significant feature in the Programme for
                Government proposals. There is an acceptance of the number of
                the people who work, are educated and live in the countryside.
                The implications for the rural communities and the aspirations
                for how this programme should affect rural life are, in theory,
                noble. The reality may prove less than a match for expectations.
                The constraints that have been placed on the budgetary scope of
                the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development have created
                a situation in which we may have missed the point. Measures
                designed to restructure rural life to provide opportunities to
                improve the skills and qualifications of the work force are
                desperately needed and are, therefore, welcome.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, in one calendar year the number of
                farm businesses in existence that offer traditional forms of
                rural employment has shrunk by 4%. To that extent we have missed
                the point. By training our young people we are in danger of
                preparing them to move away from rural communities. Our
                agriculture industry is heading towards retirement, and there is
                no incentive for young people to go into it.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.45 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The retirement scheme would have actively
                engaged young people in meeting the challenges of modern
                farming. Instead, they will drift away from our rural
                communities in search of employment. To that extent, expenditure
                targets have failed to address the problem. To put these
                comments into context, in the Moyle area, where I am a
                councillor, 25% of the population depends on agriculture for
                direct and indirect employment. That illustrates the essential
                need for radical restructuring of individual farm businesses in
                order to protect employment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Failure to provide assistance for capital
                investment on farms would have a twofold effect. First, the
                farming industry and the rural economy have been so damaged by
                crisis that it is well-nigh impossible for farm resources to
                meet the requirements of investment in deadstock, that is,
                buildings, boundary fences and fields, et cetera. Secondly, the
                impact of continued rural ruin on tourism will be such that we
                will have nothing concrete to offer.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are some positive and constructive
                proposals in this programme to sustain the life of Northern
                Ireland’s rural communities. However, because of the diversity
                of their requirements, the implications of the Programme for
                Government have not been as comprehensive or as far-reaching in
                some areas as they should be. Therefore, I contend that in some
                key areas the programme has been remiss and continues to miss
                the point.</p>

                I would like to address chapter 5, ‘Securing a Competitive
                Economy,’ from an agriculture and rural development point of
                view. The draft Programme for Government is quite a good
                document; it is extensive, although somewhat vague. The
                introduction to chapter 5 says</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;If we are to achieve a cohesive,
                inclusive and just society which places people and communities
                at its centre, it is essential that we create a vibrant economy,
                to produce employment and wealth for the future.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Two of the action points at the bottom of

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;the promotion of enterprise, innovation
                and creativity … if local industry is to compete and prosper
                in the global economy.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Agriculture is one of the main industries in
                rural areas. I am disappointed that there is no real commitment
                to farming. There is nothing in the document in relation to an
                environmental scheme which has broad support from farm
                organisations and the farming community and which the
                Agriculture and Rural Development Committee asked for. The
                Programme for Government makes no mention of a retirement scheme
                or restructuring, nor is there any installation aid to help
                young farmers get into the industry.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is nothing in the document to show that
                money will be directed to farming to raise prices, ease the debt
                situation and put money directly into farmers’ pockets. In
                defence of this, the Minister and the Department of Agriculture
                and Rural Development say that the European Union will not allow
                state aid to be handed down to farmers directly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the South this week they are launching a
                new seven- year plan in which they have given IR£3·9 billion
                to the farming economy. If they are spending that sort of money
                in the South and giving that commitment to their agricultural
                economy for the future, while we have just tinkered around the
                edges with a few things like training and the upkeep of what is
                already there, then someone has got it wrong. That is why I am
                particularly disappointed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What we asked for is what the farmers are
                asking for, and the matter will have to be looked at in the
                future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the wider economy, joined-up Government
                must look at the trade and industry side to allow small business
                development to help to replace some of the shortfall that will
                occur in the agriculture industry over the next few years. The
                IDB and LEDU — or perhaps an amalgamation of the two —
                should be of some help to the small industries. At present, the
                IDB does not help small businesses, because it can assist only
                in much larger job creation ventures.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The North/South structures of the Good Friday
                Agreement would have been very helpful. I know that there are
                those who are totally against them for their own political
                reasons, but it makes sense to work on policies which relate to
                an all-island structure. We have the same type of geography and
                farming practices here as they have in the South, yet the
                British Government policies work directly against us in almost
                every area.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As far as targeting social need is concerned,
                nowhere needs money to be directed towards it more than the
                rural areas generally and the farming industry in particular. I
                am somewhat disappointed in the part of the programme that
                relates to the rural economy. There is no real commitment to
                enhance that economy over the next few years. That has to be
                changed. Whoever is in charge of the relevant Departments in the
                future must think about moving forward and putting money into
                the base industry. The base industry must be strengthened so
                that we have something there for the future. Go raibh maith agat.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McFarland:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have listened today to a succession of
                Sinn Féin Members complaining about David Trimble. The solution
                to their problem is very simple. Sort out the weapons issue, and
                politics can return to normal. The people of Northern Ireland
                did not vote for an armed peace. Also, in listening to the DUP,
                one could be forgiven for assuming that its Ministers had
                absolutely no input into the Programme for Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Programme for Government and,
                in particular, the Executive’s action on a regional
                development strategy. For the first time we will have a cross-
                departmental strategic plan for the Province. The plan will
                spawn a rural development strategy to ensure sustainable
                development in the countryside, so that farms may diversify and
                remain viable and small villages may expand with incoming jobs,
                encouraging young people to remain in the rural areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The strategy also proposes the development of
                our infrastructure. If we are to take full advantage of the
                expected economic benefits of peace, we will need airports and
                seaports and a rail and road infrastructure which can cope with
                that. It is particularly welcome that the programme accepts that
                the rail network needs to be stabilised and developed. Next year’s
                transport strategy will map out a way forward to start rolling
                back years of underfunding.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The regional development strategy also paves
                the way for an urban regeneration strategy to introduce an
                agreed plan on how our urban areas, particularly Greater
                Belfast, are to be developed. I particularly welcome the review
                of planning statement policies. I hope that the review will stop
                the destruction of old buildings throughout the Province
                resulting from the construction of flats for financial gain.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At a time when the system of setting a 60%
                limit on building on brownfield sites in Britain is being
                revised upwards, I hope that the review will reverse the present
                proposal to set brownfield development at 40% in Belfast. Such a
                policy would provide open season for the large developers to
                destroy the hills around Belfast and most of north Down’s
                green belt.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Overall, the cross-departmental strategy
                should make Northern Ireland a better place to live in. The real
                test will come next year when detailed rural, urban and
                transport strategies will come into being and their resulting
                costs will become known.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have listened today to what I can only
                refer to as a disorganised farce passing for a debate. It is
                clear that what we have heard is a collection of individual
                views. Why? The Committees have not had sufficient time to form
                a view and present it to the House. Therefore, today’s
                exercise cannot be the last word, the second last word, or the
                third last word on this programme. The views expressed must be
                co-ordinated by the respective departmental Committees to
                preserve the integrity of the House. They must be prioritised
                before we can contemplate agreeing a final programme.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I said in October, much of the programme

                consider what we cannot see? The public-service agreements are
                extremely important: they will set out the aims, objectives and
                targets for each of the Departments. How can we offer
                constructive comment on a programme, particularly when it refers
                to the longer term and the anticipation of those public-service
                agreements? This seriously calls into question our whole modus
                operandi.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Throughout the document we are promised that
                various strategies will be put in place. On page&nbsp;45 there
                is a reference to a strategy to ensure that all of Northern
                Ireland has a world-class telecommunications infrastructure.
                That is a wonderful idea, but how is it going to happen? When is
                it going to happen? How much is it going to cost?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are told that by next summer a ten-year
                regional transportation strategy will be produced. I say
                &quot;Hallelujah&quot; to that, but will it be a rail- or
                road-orientated strategy? I do not know, because it is not in
                the draft programme. Until we see these programmes and
                strategies fleshed out, how can we tell if they meet the
                expectations of the people and address their priorities? Equally
                important is whether they are affordable within a reasonable
                time span.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The public have major concerns about health,
                education, and administration, yet it is not programmes for
                action or strategies that we see. It is reviews, and reviews
                mean more uncertainty. With a devolved Government run by locally
                elected politicians, the people want to be assured that that
                their hospital will be secure and that Northern Ireland will
                have more intensive care beds. They want to see the 11-plus and
                student fees abolished and an efficient and effective
                Administration with fewer quangos, less bureaucracy and savings
                used to finance the type of changes to which I referred earlier.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The draft programme needs strengthening in
                other areas. For example, there has been much talk about a new
                multi-sports arena for Northern Ireland. That is not mentioned
                in the document. There have been many calls at district council
                level to allow third-party planning appeals. Are these to be
                ignored? I am unclear as to whether ‘Strategy 2010’,
                referred to on pages 12 and 43 to name but two, is going to be
                speedily implemented. Where are the targets for gross domestic
                product (GDP), new business start-up, exports, et cetera? What
                about a single development agency or an economic forum?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While I appreciate that the Budget for
                2001-02 deals with the costing for that year, projected costs
                for future years would have helped. That could help
                prioritisation, and it would certainly help transparency. A
                review of public administration will be introduced to reduce the
                cost of administration. No doubt this will involve looking
                closely at local authorities, their numbers and their powers, et
                cetera. However, why is the completion of the review on the
                calculations of the resources element of the general exchequer
                grant one of the draft Programme for Government’s action plans
                for 2001? That will involve more legislation and expense.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Bradley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Programme for Government, and I
                am pleased that emphasis has been put on agriculture and rural
                development. Twenty-five years have passed during which we had
                no printed proposals to debate or anything to contribute.
                Therefore my welcome is understandable.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">6.00 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In particular, I welcome the announcement
                that within the next five&nbsp;months the Assembly will
                implement final arrangements for formal co-operation between the
                two Governments on animal health issues on the island of
                Ireland. I further welcome the announcement of a specific target
                date of March&nbsp;2002 for implementation of joint strategies
                for the improvement of animal health on both sides of the
                border. If this common-sense approach is properly implemented,
                we may see the eradication of costly diseases such as BSE,
                bovine TB and brucellosis within the next decade. The joint
                exercise makes sound economic sense, as duplication and
                expenditure will be greatly reduced when the respective research
                centres unite to address the common goal of good animal health.
                The subsequent benefits that the marketing of top-quality food
                will bring to producers and consumers alike is a plus factor to
                which we can all look forward</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the proposal for free travel for
                senior citizens. This could be implemented very quickly if the
                Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, the
                Minister for Social Development and the Minister for Regional
                Development accept that it is within their respective powers to
                assist financially a free travel programme. Some Members have
                claimed the free travel proposals to be the policy of their
                respective parties. In the SDLP we have sought this facility for
                decades, but just like the other parties, our message was
                falling on the deaf ears of direct rule Ministers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the fact that efforts are being
                made to secure proposals for the introduction of North/South and
                north-west gas pipelines. I hope that if they are not introduced
                simultaneously, the North/South aspect will get priority.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I endorse the comments of those who addressed
                the positive attention paid to matters such as protecting our
                villages and hamlets, training for members of the rural
                community, the importance of infrastructure and transport, the
                beef quality initiative, et cetera. I ask all Members to adopt
                as policy the words of the Executive in section 5.4.1 of the
                Programme for Government:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;We will work together to regenerate the
                rural economy.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, as party spokesman for agriculture,
                I welcome the announcement in the rural regeneration section of
                the programme that the Executive have agreed to establish a
                ministerial group to proof all Government policies for rural
                impact. This paragraph alone will offer great assurance to the
                rural community and those of us concerned with the future of
                agriculture and rural development.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr William McCrea:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr J Wilson said earlier that this Programme
                for Government was a great gain brought about through the
                Belfast Agreement. The old saying is that the proof of the
                pudding is in the eating. The community is going to have to
                digest some very serious pudding. I have no doubt that much of
                the document is designed for presentational purposes and that
                behind much of the rhetoric there is little of consequence.
                However, it will be a good benchmark by which we can judge the
                operational effectiveness of individual Departments.
                Alban&nbsp;Maginness said that one of the most substantial parts
                of the document was that relating to the Department for Regional
                Development. Naturally I concur that my Colleagues take their
                departmental responsibilities seriously and will prove to be
                excellent Ministers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Paragraph&nbsp;1.8 could be regarded as
                outlining the Programme for Government’s mission statement on
                environmental issues. It says that a good quality built and
                natural environment is the key to our economy, helping to
                attract investors and visitors as well as being integral to the
                future of agriculture. It adds that sustainability must be the
                key theme running through the Executive’s work.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those are very fine words, but the words
                might be the weightiest part of it, because the Environment
                Committee does not consider that sustainability is a key theme
                of the Programme for Government. Does the Minister consider that
                it has been given a sufficiently high profile, and if he
                believes it has, can he explain how and where it appears in the
                Programme for Government? The Committee understands that it is
                unlikely that the environment will benefit to any significant
                extent from the Executive’s funds.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does this reflect the real priority attached
                to the protection of our environment? The Environment Committee
                is concerned that there is virtually no mention in the Programme
                for Government of the need to protect the built heritage. Can
                the Minister tell us why? This absence is borne out by the
                failure of the bid for additional funding for the historic
                building grant that will lead to a loss of funding from the
                Heritage Lottery Fund. Is this how we will protect our heritage?
                Those are fine words, but what of substance?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Section 5.2.3 sets out a number of actions to
                be taken to create a more efficient planning process. The
                Committee would like to know if the Department has secured the
                necessary resources to carry forward this work. If not, how
                realistic is the aim of the programme to clear the backlog in
                planning applications by December 2002?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Section 3.1.5 refers to &quot;The Well-being
                of our Children&quot;. The Environment Committee welcomes the
                active increase in the number of road safety education officers.
                The safety of our children is of paramount importance to the
                Committee. At its first public inquiry, the Committee will be
                looking into the legislation which allows up to 101 children
                under 14 years old on a 53-seater bus. How can the Programme for
                Government claim that the emphasis on improving road safety
                through education will continue, when the Department itself
                considers that overcrowding of school buses is safe?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Section 3.3 states</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;we will not only fulfil our EU

                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Can the Minister assure me that the
                Department of the Environment is now in a position to implement
                EU Directives and will no longer be in danger of infraction
                proceedings? Can the Minister guarantee that we will fulfil all
                our EU obligations as stated in the Programme for Government? If
                not, this claim should not be made.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Section 7.4 of the Programme for Government
                refers to</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;greater accountability for all services
                through a more efficient and effective structure of

                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given that we are to have local government
                elections next year, the Environment Committee has been
                endeavouring to obtain information about accountability from the
                Minister and his Department. Is it not time that the Department
                came clean on this issue?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Kennedy:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am grateful for the opportunity to address
                the Assembly on this subject. The Programme for Government is
                ambitious, and it remains to be seen whether all that is
                promised will actually be achieved. Only time will tell. As
                Chairman of the Education Committee, I would like to bring a
                number of comments to the attention of the Assembly. This
                document puts strong emphasis on new TSN at an educational
                level. The Education Committee is unable to confirm that the
                action it has planned reflects the issues in the Programme for
                Government or vice versa. We await the outcome of that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Equality issues are also prominent in the
                document, and the Department of Education is still awaiting a
                response from the Equality Commission on whether its equality
                scheme will be acceptable. Many issues remain unresolved, and
                the Education Committee will scrutinise that work.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Through its memorandum on the Budget, the
                Education Committee has sought to obtain an allocation of the
                Executive’s Programme Funds for education. In the coming years
                it will press for as many resources as possible for education.
                Education is a priority. We also note the inclusion of
                public-service agreements in the Programme for Government and
                intend to scrutinise these targets to assess their educational
                value to the Department.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Education recently issued a
                consultation paper on the viability criteria for Irish- medium
                and integrated schools, and the Education Committee wants the
                same viability criteria to be applied to all schools, while
                ensuring that there is educational choice for every child and
                parent.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given the rural nature of Northern Ireland,
                the Education Committee acknowledges the important role schools
                play, particularly in rural regeneration. We note the actions
                which relate specifically to education and will monitor closely
                the implementation of these targets and stated policies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Education Committee has asked the
                Department of Education to undertake research into early formal
                education, given that children in other European countries start
                their education at a later age. We will make comparisons and
                monitor the future progress of the transfer system.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Education has stated that
                it intends to review the current educational arrangements of
                what are called &quot;quangos&quot; — quasi-autonomous,
                non-governmental organisations. My Committee welcomes this and
                would like to see proposals for taking this forward at an early
                stage.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A great deal is promised in this Programme
                for Government, but much of the detail is missing at this stage.
                Only as we scrutinise the work of the Department of Education
                over the coming months will our members be convinced that
                everything is possible and that appropriate action is being
                taken on all these points.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Gibson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have heard many comments about this
                document today. Some people have called it transparent, and I
                would certainly call it transparent — to the point of
                opaqueness. It is a great wish list. It is a weaker document
                than many believe, for it is transparently unrealistic.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us turn to the last three paragraphs on
                page 10 that pay particular attention to the needs of victims.
                The sum of £4 million goes to prisoners who have perpetrated
                the deeds against the victims, while the victims receive
                £40,000. We are committed to helping those affected by economic
                difficulties and to give them equal opportunities. I have sat in
                this Chamber and heard about a partnership which distributes
                European and British money to the Catholic population that
                describes itself as a Catholic body with a few token Prods. Is
                this tackling inequality? Certainly not. Is this a just society?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Last Saturday evening a truck came in to blow
                up another Armistice Day commemoration. There have been 49
                contract murders since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us look at the top of page 11. Two
                sentences there show that some people are more equal than
                others. When we examine this document in detail, we see it as a
                willy-nilly wish list, a grouping of clichés that may be
                acceptable to some people in this Building who have no contact
                with reality.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to pursue this and to examine the
                transparency needed to achieve equality in the distribution of
                funds to schools, because 80% of funding goes to the Council for
                Catholic Maintained Schools sector. Is that equality? Those of
                us who are used to the real world must view this document with a
                little scepticism.</p>

                criteria to help promote integrated education — 2% of
                education. By 2001 we will implement new viability criteria to
                help promote Irish-medium education — only 1% of the
                population can speak Irish. Where are our priorities? We then
                have some obscure statement about an Environment and Heritage
                Service education strategy. Alban Maginness is right, and those
                Ministers who have taken themselves seriously have put down a
                programme that can be costed and targeted with an implementation
                date. In many cases we have wish lists. Education is every
                citizens’ bedrock, regardless of class or creed. The Minister
                may have been a field marshal elsewhere, but the abilities
                demonstrated in this document are those of a field mouse —
                maybe a Mickey Mouse.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We can turn to other areas that have been
                neglected in the past few years. The Minister of Health will
                review the cardiac services to assess their efficiency and
                effectiveness and develop best practice. We have backlogs
                running into months. The Western Health and Social Services
                Board has been forced to send patients to London. It was cheaper
                to send the patient and his wife to London than to have the
                operation here in Northern Ireland. Why do we not treat hip
                replacements in the same way? Why have we not tackled the
                problem? Rather than a wish list, we have developed a review of
                cardiac services. It can be done, but it has not been done. The
                truth of the matter is that there is neither the will nor the
                ability within those Departments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When we look at the packaging of care, on
                page 34, we see four wish lists. The truth is that the patient’s
                charter has come off every hospital notice board. Already there
                has been a departure from what is written here.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In section 1 of the draft Programme for
                Government I note a vision that we can all aspire to for a
                Utopia in Northern Ireland sometime in the future. In the
                meantime we have to address the first sentence of the mission
                statement on page 13:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;to make a difference to the lives of
                our people, enabling them to grow as a peaceful, fair and
                inclusive community.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I question the commitment of Sinn Féin
                Ministers and their Members to this statement and wonder when,
                if ever, the shadow of the gun will be removed from our society.
                My party, and every party on this side of the Chamber, questions
                that. The SDLP should also question that, but it seems to be
                adhering more to the Hume/Adams agreement than to the Belfast
                Agreement. Maybe there is another Programme for Government
                coming from that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The broad-brush scope of sections 2 to 7 in
                the draft must be fine-tuned. I hope that the final programme
                the Executive produces will take on board the many concerns that
                have arisen today. We all know that everything cannot be done at
                once. In general I welcome the action plans, but I await greater
                detail on an overall prioritised list for implementation as
                asked for by Mr Close before I can give my final verdict.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Item 2.4 promises regeneration of the
                physical built environment and is most welcome, given that its
                remit extends across the whole community, rural and urban. It
                recognises that strong communities are central to economic,
                social and cultural development. I strongly support those
                Members who have already addressed the sincere concerns of the
                rural community, particularly in the west, with regard to
                equality of access to primary care services, hospital treatment
                and after-care facilities within the Health Service, under
                section 3. This must be done, as Mr Gibson has said, in a
                reasonable time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the finest education systems in the
                world has been weakened by quick-fix, mainland-imposed policies.
                Any reviews under paragraph 4 of the programme must seek to
                restore confidence both inside and outside the school system,
                particularly in vocational areas of study. I welcome the
                development of this field, in both secondary and tertiary level
                education. In today’s world, education is closely linked to
                the creation of a secure competitive economy, as is the
                implementation of provincewide infrastructural policies.
                Therefore, I welcome the aim of ensuring that there will be an
                infrastructure for competition.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I seek assurance that the Executive’s final
                programme will ensure that priorities throughout Northern
                Ireland are treated equally. Actions under paragraph 6 to
                promote Northern Ireland’s image abroad are also most welcome.
                However, in the strategy for securing high-profile international
                events there must be a recognition of the need for appropriate
                facilities and for Northern Ireland to be considered as a whole
                in any marketing strategy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, I ask Ministers to consider very
                carefully the proposals for arrangements to ensure that the
                rates provide an adequate level of funding for public
                expenditure. I remind the Executive that, for three consecutive
                years, the regional rate was increased by 8% by direct rule
                Ministers. This was a cumulative rise of 26%, which, we were
                told, would be channelled specifically into infrastructural
                development. I am concerned that the Assembly should seek to
                continue this situation prior to a proposed review of rating
                policy by March 2002.</p>

                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Education (Mr M McGuinness): </b>Go
                raibh maith agat, A LeasCheann Comhairle. I am grateful to my
                Colleague, Seán Farren, who opened this debate, but I stress
                the importance of the Programme for Government in setting our
                agenda on education.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have a successful education system, which
                has shown progress in recent years. Our economic success depends
                on the quality of our education and training system. The
                experience of the South is an illustration of what can be
                achieved with a well-educated and highly-motivated workforce.
                Therefore, there is no alternative to investment in education if
                we want to improve the quality of people’s lives and offer
                them the prospect of fulfilling, well-paid and stable
                employment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our education system has improved in recent
                years, despite its legacy of problems and significant under-
                investment over a considerable period. However, much remains to
                be done. We have had one of the lowest levels of access to
                pre-school education in western Europe. We still face serious
                problems of low and under achievement. This was illustrated
                today when Ian Paisley Jr admitted that he had go to the Library
                to find out the meaning of the word &quot;sustain&quot;.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must also respond to the challenge of the
                digital revolution and to the phenomenal growth of ICT. We need
                a secondary education system which values our children and
                develops their potential to the maximum. I want to put the three
                &quot;Ens&quot; — encouragement, enlightenment and enjoyment
                — at the heart of our education system, and it is vital that
                we do so. This is the underlying rationale for the schools and
                youth sections of the Programme for Government, which is rooted
                in a clear analysis of our needs. We must invest in our
                education system to ensure that there is equality, excellence,
                choice and accessibility.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A central element of the Programme for
                Government is our pursuit of co-operation through the
                North/South Ministerial Council. Our education systems, North
                and South, spring from the same historical roots, and we face
                the same problems of under achievement and unfulfilled
                potential. We are both struggling to cater for the special
                educational needs of our most marginalized children. We need to
                co-operate, to share best practice and to develop joint
                provision for the most specialised forms of support. The
                North/South strand is a key element of my programme, which has
                the potential to deliver real and immediate benefits to all
                children. I am deeply concerned that the attitude and actions of
                the First Minister will impede this work and have a directly
                negative effect on the education of our children.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many were sceptical of the Executive
                Committee’s ability to reach agreement on the draft Programme
                for Government. I am delighted to say that their scepticism was
                confounded, because those of us who support the agreement
                determined that this was an opportunity to deliver change and,
                within the monetary limitations imposed upon us, to make a real
                difference for all our people. I had hoped that we could enter
                this debate in that same spirit of co-operation and partnership.
                However, the decisions taken by the Ulster Unionist Council at
                the Waterfront Hall represent a full-frontal assault on the
                institutions established under the terms of the Good Friday
                Agreement. It is bizarre that we are conducting a debate on an
                agreed Programme for Government, when the First Minister has
                informed his party that it is his objective to see the
                institutions suspended or collapsed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The decisions taken by the Ulster Unionist
                Council must call into question the commitment of the Ulster
                Unionist Party. The party’s decisions also call into question
                the commitment of its Assembly team and its Ministers to the
                Programme for Government. Most pointedly, the attempt to
                obstruct the functioning of the North/South Ministerial Council
                blatantly contradicts the commitment in the draft Programme for
                Government to the development of North/South co-operation and
                relations. The exclusion imposed on the Minister of Health,
                Social Services and Public Safety and the First Minister’s
                discrimination against her, directly contradict the commitment
                he declared in the draft Programme for Government to equality,
                inclusivity and partnership.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First&nbsp;Minister’s actions also fly
                in the face of his commitment to the Executive as a unifying
                force for the community. To have any prospect of achieving a
                cohesive, inclusive and just society requires, in the first
                instance, a cohesive, inclusive and just Executive Committee. We
                need to get real, folks. This debate is being conducted against
                a background of determined attempts by the Ulster Unionist Party
                to collapse this Assembly, and with it the other institutions in
                which we are involved. This is ridiculous.</p>

                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of the Environment (Mr Foster): </b>Despite
                the ominous and destructive Republican weapons of war, and the
                backdrop of terrorist activity in my home county of Fermanagh
                over the weekend — 13 years after Enniskillen — I welcome
                this opportunity to take part in the debate. The Programme for
                Government is an important document which illustrates what can
                be achieved when local Ministers work together. It clearly
                demonstrates that a locally elected Executive can make a real
                and positive difference. This could be destroyed by Republican
                intransigence.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was pleased with the emphasis placed on
                environmental matters by many Members today. Several Members
                referred to the importance of sustainability. My ministerial
                Colleagues and I support that. The Programme for Government
                undertakes to prepare a sustainable development strategy.
                Sustainable development covers every aspect of Government, and
                it ensures that we consider fully the needs of future
                generations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is equally important for environmental
                issues. The Programme for Government recognises the crucial
                importance of the environment to a healthy community and a
                competitive economy. This is supported by the draft budget
                allocation, which will be discussed tomorrow and which provides
                a 14.4% funding increase for my Department — a clear signal
                that the Executive has recognised the need to deal with former
                underfunding of environmental issues, road safety and local
                government functions. We will work to ensure that the additional
                £10&nbsp;million allocated in the draft budget for implementing
                EU Directives will help improve our air, land and water quality.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In reply to Rev Dr William&nbsp;McCrea, the
                budget for environmental programmes next year will increase by
                almost 40%. This is a true reflection of the importance that the
                Programme for Government places on environmental matters.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In this section of the debate, we are
                specifically considering the actions in the Programme for
                Government to secure a competitive economy.</p>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The protection of the environment is critical
                for economic growth, and we want to ensure that businesses
                develop in a sustainable manner. International businesses in
                particular will be very aware of their environmental
                responsibilities, but these responsibilities are not just for
                them. Members will be aware of the major conference on climate
                change which commenced today in The Hague. Some 5,000 delegates
                from 180 countries will be discussing how greenhouse gas
                emissions can be cut. We must all take steps to ensure that the
                environment is protected.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Programme for Government deals with other
                areas of my Department’s remit. Earlier in the year, I
                announced that I was increasing the number of road safety
                education officers and intensifying the road safety advertising
                campaign. The Programme for Government commits the Executive to
                a new road safety plan which will set out a strategy for further
                reductions in the totally unacceptable level of carnage on our
                roads.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another aspect of my Department’s activity
                reflected in the Programme for Government is planning. A growing
                economy requires development, and we all want to encourage that.
                We also need to protect the environment and social amenities
                and, therefore, we need a proper and efficient planning process
                which will make a major contribution to facilitating economic
                growth. I have already initiated a review of the processes in
                the Planning Service, and I am committed to addressing the
                backlogs with planning applications and to furthering area
                development plans, including the major Belfast metropolitan area
                plan.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also welcome the commitment to a review of
                public administration in the Programme for Government. I want to
                ensure an efficient and effective local government for
                ratepayers and full consultation for district councils in review
                plans.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As shown by the debate in the Assembly today,
                there has been a keen interest in the Programme for Government,
                and a number of Members have raised specific issues relating to
                my Department. In the short time available to me, I cannot
                address each of those issues, but I have sought to comment on
                the main themes. I trust that Members will realise the
                significance of the programme and give it their support.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Agriculture and Rural
                Development (Ms Rodgers):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to place on record my thanks to
                ministerial Colleagues for their co-operation in ensuring that
                the importance of the rural economy and rural society is
                recognised in the draft Programme for Government. I also thank
                the great number of Members who have spoken in this debate about
                the importance of our rural economy and the agriculture
                industry. That proves — if proof were needed — the
                importance of the rural society to Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In referring very briefly to the comments
                made by Jim Wells about early retirement, I remind him that that
                issue is not contained in the rural development regulation plan
                submitted to Brussels and, therefore, that it cannot now be
                introduced until the review stage. I have not ruled it out. I
                will remind Mr Wells, however, that the three and a half months
                of suspension of the Assembly — which he approved and
                supported — was at the time when the plan was being prepared,
                and we as an Executive and an Assembly were denied an input at
                that crucial stage.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also wish to inform Mr Wells that the
                feedback I get on a daily basis from farmers in all sections of
                the community indicates that they want to retain their local
                Administration and that they appreciate the accessibility and
                responsiveness of a local Minister. If further proof were needed
                of that, we have it in this programme, which shows that the
                Assembly is responsive and that it is making a difference. This
                a clear spur to all of us to reach agreement and to ensure that
                the structures we have remain in place.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One area that has been very neglected under
                direct rule is agriculture. It is my intention to build on the
                impetus that has already been established. I am especially
                pleased to have secured a commitment that all major Government
                policies will in future be rural proofed. By this I mean that
                all major policy proposals will be carefully and objectively
                examined to determine their impact on rural dwellers. We all
                want to see public services being fairly made available to all
                people in Northern Ireland, regardless of where they live, and
                we want people to be able to realise their potential and their
                aspirations without being hampered by whether they live in a
                city or a town.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The draft Programme for Government also sets
                a new direction for assistance to farmers and gives a new
                impetus to rural development. I am acutely conscious of the
                genuine hardship being experienced by farmers and rural
                dwellers, but as I listen to them, I have also been struck by
                their sense of frustration. They believe that their views are
                not being listened to and that policy makers too often bring to
                bear an exclusively urban perspective on problems.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rightly or wrongly, they fear that solutions
                may be adopted that do not fit rural circumstances. The
                Executive Committee is agreed that we need to take action now to
                ensure that we do not foster an urban/rural divide in a society
                that has already suffered too much from divisions. That is why
                the commitment to rural proofing is so important.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The draft Programme for Government contains
                an explicit commitment to build on the recommendations of the
                vision for the future of the agri-food industry exercise. It
                outlines initiatives to enhance the competitiveness of farming
                by improving quality, particularly beef quality, and by
                developing education and training programmes aimed at enhancing
                competitiveness.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is also an emphasis on the environment
                that includes assisting the fishing industry to develop in a
                sustainable way and enhancing forestry programmes. Furthermore,
                there is an explicit commitment to the regeneration of rural
                areas, particularly the most disadvantaged. The proposed new
                approach covers not only agriculture, forestry and fisheries,
                but also the economy in rural areas and support for rural
                societies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have a well-established rural development
                programme, and we are integrating its contributions with the
                rest of Government to produce a co-ordinated approach. A good
                example of that is the initiative to establish a natural
                resource rural tourism programme which draws together my
                Department, the Northern Ireland Tourist Board and the
                Environment and Heritage Service of the Department of the
                Environment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also welcome the commitment to work more
                closely with the South on a formal and strategic basis. In the
                cases of agriculture, fisheries and certain animal health
                issues, there are practical benefits. There is also support for
                the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission. We will also
                be developing a strategy to promote rural development on a
                cross-border basis by working through various community
                initiatives with European Union support to develop network links
                and enhance different parts of the rural economy and society on
                a cross-border basis.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also welcome the commitment to put rural
                community transport partnerships into operation, and the
                Department for Regional Development’s commitment to preparing
                a regional planning policy statement on the countryside, as well
                as their commitment to put in place 15 new rural transport
                partnerships.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Minister, the time is up.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister for Regional Development (Mr
                Campbell):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that I do not have to avail of the
                extra 13 seconds that the previous contributor used.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some Members who spoke earlier were diverted
                into a series of political issues, but I do not wish to be so
                diverted. There are a number of matters within the Department
                for Regional Development’s responsibility that I intend to
                pursue vigorously in the forthcoming year. I will do that in
                keeping with my election commitment until we get a satisfactory
                governmental system that has the consent and support of the
                Unionist community as well as the existing one that has the
                consent of the Nationalist community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some Members referred to free fares for the
                elderly. That is a top priority for my Department. I have
                identified it as a priority, as did my predecessor, and we are
                determined that it should be introduced at the earliest
                opportunity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some references were made to the burden that
                was being placed on local councils as a result of the
                consultation exercise. Members will be aware that we had a
                series of consultation exercises and that this will be a
                voluntary scheme for councils that wish to participate. If
                Members do not wish to burden local councils, they will have, in
                the Budget debate, the opportunity to vote the several million
                pounds that would be required to have the scheme implemented and
                controlled directly by the Department for Regional Development.
                I would welcome that, as I bid for the money in the first
                instance.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The regional development strategy will
                provide the strategic planning to plan our infrastructure more
                effectively. I want to put in place innovative arrangements at
                sub- regional level to ensure the effective implementation of
                that strategy. The regional transportation strategy, which my
                officials are working on, is an offshoot of that. Many in the
                House, and those outside, commented favourably on the work of
                the officials who were on the railways taskforce. The same group
                is working on the regional transportation strategy. I hope to be
                able to bring out the first draft of that document before the
                summer recess. It will be of fundamental importance to the whole
                of Northern&nbsp;Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will move to rail travel. I mentioned that
                the taskforce carried out very comprehensive and worthwhile
                work. A party Colleague said that under the draft budget
                £102&nbsp;million was put in place, but the figure is actually
                £105&nbsp;million. We are in a position to put the framework in
                place, but that will not be the ultimate solution. It will not
                deliver a two-tier rail service, but it will provide the
                infrastructure and the bedrock upon which we will build a
                comprehensive rail strategy for the whole of Northern Ireland,
                not just for the most frequently used lines.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In conclusion, I want to refer to two
                fundamentally important issues — the infrastructural fund and
                the reference to it in the Programme for Government regarding
                roads and water. The underinvestment is such that I will support
                any effort to get a one-off payment for an infrastructural fund.
                Several Members have mentioned this, but we need something
                substantial. Without encroaching on the next Member’s time, I
                want to thank the Regional Development Committee for its
                assistance throughout, and I look forward to its assistance in
                the coming year.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Mr Speaker in the Chair)</p>
                </i><b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and
                Investment (Sir Reg Empey):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is not possible, in the time available, to
                carry out a normal winding-up of the debate or to respond to the
                many points made.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, I want to mention a matter raised by
                Mr Close on the procedures available to Members who wish to
                comment further. This is a draft Programme for Government, and
                it has been submitted to the Assembly for consideration and
                ultimate approval. We are currently seeking the views of
                Assembly Committees, particularly on actions relevant to the
                first year of the programme, but the views of others also have
                to be taken into account. The Civic Forum has been asked to
                consider the proposals set out in the draft programme and will
                give its views on those. The document has also been made
                available more generally to key stakeholders such as district
                councils, trade unions and representative bodies across many
                sectors and to other interested groups and individuals. People
                have been encouraged to respond with their views on its
                contents, and we welcome that. The feedback will be used to
                improve the document so that we can present a more detailed
                programme to the Assembly in the new year, one which will
                incorporate public-service agreements for each Department, which
                is fundamental to how the programme is joined up and the actions
                determined.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The third and concluding part of the debate
                focused on education, training, the economy and infrastructure.
                Like other priorities in the Programme for Government, these are
                important issues for our community’s future prosperity and
                quality of life. While I, and the Education, Regional
                Development, and Higher and Further Education, Training and
                Employment Ministers clearly have lead roles in these
                priorities, all Ministers and Departments have a contribution to
                make in achieving these goals. The fact that in the last few
                minutes we have had contributions from the four parties making
                up the Executive is not without its own significance.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Members for their worthwhile
                contributions throughout the day, although at times one or two
                of them appeared to be on autopilot, probably blissfully unaware
                of what they were saying and participating in. Nevertheless, the
                general contribution has been important. Members have made some
                very good suggestions that should be followed up.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">6.45 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These suggestions should be taken up in the
                Committees’ Consideration Stage, and I welcome the fact that
                people were able, albeit briefly, to make an initial response to
                the programme. Copies of Hansard will be available to the
                Departments. I have asked my officials to take note of certain
                points on which I picked up, in the context of my portfolio, and
                other Ministers will do the same. Ultimately, we have a unique
                opportunity to make a real difference to this community, in
                spite of our political problems. The Minister of Education and
                his colleagues made known their views. However, it is an
                unavoidable fact that they have a major contribution to make and
                a responsibility for these matters. The problems we face today
                are not for someone else but for everyone to deal with —
                perhaps Mr McGuinness will devote some of his attention to this
                fact.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The programme does have its weaknesses, and
                there are areas in need of improvement, but it has nevertheless
                been a comprehensive attempt to merge, for the first time, the
                various strands of Government, the different themes and the
                cross-cutting elements. It has been an attempt to get away from
                the silo mentality and to try to offer a vision of what this
                Province could be like if we get the opportunity to implement
                the programme.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must bear in mind the 30 years of misery
                which have gone before us, with all the wasted opportunities,
                and the fact that we have very little time left to catch up with
                our major competitors. European funding will come to an end in
                five or six years’ time; competition is at an all-time high;
                and developing countries throughout the world are snapping at
                our heels. Nobody owes Northern Ireland a living, and my
                Colleagues will be doing their best to provide the best possible
                service and infrastructure, using the resources available, to
                provide the people of Northern Ireland with a real future for
                themselves and their children. I commend this programme to the
                House.</p>
