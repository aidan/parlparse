                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That this Assembly calls on the Minister of
                Finance and Personnel, the Executive and the Chancellor of the
                Exchequer to respond to the current crisis resulting from the
                outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease by introducing a hardship
                relief package to reflect the fall in incomes being experienced,
                not only by farm- related businesses but also by businesses in
                the tourist industry.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, I will explain the basis of the
                motion. The motion came about after a joint meeting of the
                Committees for Finance and Personnel and Enterprise, Trade and
                Investment. I welcome the cross-departmental Committee approach
                to the matter and hope that we will receive a cross-departmental
                response. It is important that we achieve joined-up Government
                on this issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion reflects a recognition of the
                major crisis in Northern Ireland as a result of foot-and-mouth
                disease. The two Committees have agreed to sponsor the motion,
                but I am speaking on a personal basis as a Member of the
                Assembly, not as the Chairperson of the Finance and Personnel
                Committee. I have had no direction from the Committee. My
                comments are my own recollections of the matter.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker.
                The motion is clearly in the name of the Chairperson of the
                Committee for Finance and Personnel. The Member now says that he
                is not speaking as Chairperson but rather on a personal basis.
                Either the Order Paper is wrong or something else is wrong. Will
                you give a ruling?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Madam Deputy Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member is moving the motion on behalf of
                the Committee of Finance and Personnel, and, in that capacity,
                he is moving the motion as Chairperson of that Committee.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Kennedy:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Further to that point of order, Madam Deputy
                Speaker. I thought I heard the Member say that he did not have
                the permission of his Committee to speak as Chairperson. It is
                not an agreed response, and he is, therefore, putting forward
                his own personal view.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important to clarify to the House
                whether Mr Molloy’s remarks are supported by the weight of his
                Committee, or whether he is merely expressing his personal view.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Madam Deputy Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would be grateful, Mr Molloy, if you would
                clarify that point before continuing.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Molloy:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A LeasCheann Chomhairle, I will explain my
                position in an attempt to avoid any problems later. I am
                proposing the motion as Chairperson of the Committee. I have the
                endorsement of both Committees. Having first proposed the
                motion, I went on to speak in my own capacity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion calls for the Minister, the
                Executive and the Chancellor of the Exchequer to respond to the
                crisis by introducing a hardship relief package to reflect the
                fall in incomes. This crisis hit the farming community,
                particularly farmers, who have suffered severe hardship. We are
                all linked to that community, and the economy is strongly based
                on agriculture, therefore every aspect of life, particularly
                business life, is affected by this crisis. Farmers whose flocks
                have been destroyed have been compensated for their animals, but
                they have not been reimbursed to cover restocking and loss of
                income. They have nothing to sell at the end of the year, no
                ground to rent, and ground rents to pay. They face an uncertain
                future which, because of that uncertainty, the banks do not want
                to hear about.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All farmers are affected by the crisis, but
                they cannot get compensation to alleviate a number of those
                losses. For instance, sheep on common grazing ground cannot be
                turned out on that ground. Where should those sheep graze at
                present? Farmers do not know whether to sow fertilizer for
                future grazing — if they sow it but then cannot use the land,
                how are they to be compensated for that loss?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Culled sows cannot be exported to Germany at
                present, with the result that there is a build-up of stock on
                farms, thus leading to excessive bills for feed. Even if a
                farmer is eventually able to sell those animals, he will not
                have benefited from this delay. A mechanism is needed by which
                those animals can be culled and taken off the farms, thereby
                reducing the cost of keeping those animals alive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These are the questions that farmers have
                been asking. These problems need to be responded to through a
                package. Farmers are also suffering the knock-on effects of the
                closure of the countryside. I do not refer solely to the closure
                of country walks, but to farm marts, which in some cases have
                been closed by the Department for ten weeks. These closures have
                been reinforced by the European Union. Marts are gaining no
                turnover because farmers are banned from using the facilities.
                The income of one mart has been reduced to 15% of an average
                year’s profit. There are no cattle or sheep sales, and no land
                lettings for those marts. The fact that people are unable to
                enter farms means that income cannot be generated from other
                sources, yet they still have to pay rates and other bills.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Over the last few years, farmers have been
                advised to diversify their activity by starting up farm
                businesses. I received a letter from the owners of a saddlery
                business, which has lost its normal turnover of £75,000 to
                £80,000 a year. This loss is a result of the cancellation of
                horse shows throughout Ireland and the restriction of other
                means by which the business can be carried out.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They are depending on the countryside and
                shows being opened up. Michael Meacher’s scheme for small firm
                loans does not affect them; they cannot access those loans.
                These people have no security; on paper they have no future, so
                the banks do not want to know.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">School trips and tours to the countryside
                have all been cancelled. Various sections of the tourism
                industry have been closed down, so coach companies are operating
                about one third of their previous business. Open farms —</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker. It
                is increasingly difficult for Members of this House to listen to
                the concern expressed by Mr Molloy and his Colleagues for the
                farming community. One considers vivid pictures of ladies having
                to guard their husbands and tractors as he and his Colleagues
                sought to murder them and put them out of business — to take
                their lives, never mind their livelihoods. It is nothing short
                of a disgrace.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Madam Deputy Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order. As regards points of order, I will ask
                the Member to make reference to the Standing Order he invokes.
                Please continue, Mr Molloy.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Molloy:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thank you, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Open farms
                have been closed down completely, therefore no income has been
                earned from them. Farm shops are closed. While they may have had
                a good start to the year, machinery businesses have now found
                that hire- purchase companies and lease companies are refusing
                to grant leases. That is because businesses have no money, no
                prospects of money coming in and, again, no security. Banks do
                not want to lend money, and in some quarters the farm businesses
                that are selling machinery and supplies to the industry have
                been closed down.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While hotels and bed-and-breakfast
                accommodation are still open and still have to pay their bills,
                they do not make any income, because tourists are not arriving
                in the numbers which had been expected. Tourist areas like the
                Glens and the Sperrins have been affected dramatically in that
                way. For these businesses, costs continue, but no income is
                being made.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Even in urban areas, shops have been
                affected. Farmers were part of that trade; they supported
                business and shops in small towns, but now they do not have the
                income. Business is affected, because farmers do not know where
                their future lies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I certainly do not purport to have all the
                answers to this. However, I am sure that we will throw out many
                ideas in today’s debate. First, we must recognise that this is
                not just a crisis on the farm; this problem has a wider aspect
                to it. Our economy is based around agriculture, and while many
                full-time farmers derive their income totally from farming, many
                others are part-time farmers and in various jobs. They need farm
                business so as to support their families. They also need the
                support of the broader community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need to stimulate a cross-departmental
                response. It is for that reason that the motion calls for the
                Executive to produce a package which will actually respond to
                this catastrophe.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chancellor of the Exchequer must put that
                package of finances together. If we try to do it out of the
                grant under the Barnett formula, then it simply will not happen,
                as that grant will not provide sufficient funds. We need the
                Chancellor to open up the war chest and ensure that it is used
                now in a very productive way to alleviate the emergency in the
                farming and rural community. If we try to do it ourselves within
                the Barnett formula, we will extend the problem rather than
                alleviate it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Social welfare is one area in which an
                immediate response can be initiated. In that respect, we need to
                take into account the prices for farmers but not the land that
                the farmers live on. In the past, farmland, machinery and assets
                were all taken into account before people were deemed entitled
                to benefit. In the circumstances, I hope that the Department for
                Social Development can actually set that aside for now and deal
                with this in a flexible and considered way. It must be taken
                into account that farmers are in crisis and do not normally go
                looking for social benefit. There is real fear in their
                community that they may be forced to sell their land, machinery
                and plant if they apply for benefits.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">10.45 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rates rebate is one of the options that may
                come up in the package — a means of dealing with the crisis
                right away. If we use accelerated passage in the way that we
                have done for certain finance legislation, I am sure that there
                would be cross-community support to ensure that that happened
                quickly. Farmers are in a crisis. They have no money coming in,
                but the rate bills still come. It is not good enough to defer
                payment for three months. They will still have to pay the full
                bills over nine or ten months. Deferring payment will not help
                farmers or farm businesses, who will be forced to pay a high
                rate. We need to take into account the fact that there has been
                a reduction in income and turnover when calculating the rates
                and not deal with them as before.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The best way of alleviating the problem would
                be to give a direct grant. The Exchequer could put a
                direct-grant package together, payable to businesses across the
                spectrum that have lost income because of the crisis. They would
                have to provide proof that loss had been incurred, and their
                accounts could be used for this.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There should be a regeneration grant for farm
                businesses that are trying to restock and get going again to
                ensure that they will be able to do this. Farm businesses are
                affected in the same way as other businesses. The IDB and other
                agencies put packages together to try to attract businesses.
                Here we have businesses that are already part of the economy,
                and it is important to help them rebuild. They will, after all,
                be rebuilding the economy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I urge the Minister and the Executive to put
                pressure on the Chancellor of the Exchequer to put such a
                financial package together. Others may have ideas about what to
                include in that package, but we need to recognise the urgency of
                this. It needs to happen right away. The situation cannot be
                allowed to linger, because the farming community will go under
                as a result of this crisis. It needs to be dealt with now.</p>

                Investment (Sir Reg Empey):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since we last addressed this issue the full
                extent of the hardship is beginning to emerge in surprising
                places. My office is currently dealing with between 40 and 50
                cases of a variety of businesses that are suffering significant
                degrees of distress. The most obvious and urgent impact is
                primarily on the tourism industry. However, difficulties are
                also emerging in many consequential businesses. For example, the
                cancellation of agricultural shows has affected the suppliers of
                cups and rosettes and others who service these events. They have
                suddenly found their incomes completely obliterated. People who
                sell farm requisites such as barbed-wire fencing are also
                finding a sudden drop or cessation in their turnovers. The most
                obvious difficulties are in the tourism sector, where it is
                clear in many cases that there have been overall reductions. In
                other cases businesses have flatlined completely due to their
                proximity to agricultural land or a fishing estate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Members know, my Department has initiated,
                through the Northern Ireland Tourist Board, a recovery plan for
                tourism. This was an initial reaction to try to show that
                tourist facilities are open for business, provided people follow
                the guidelines set out by the Department of Agriculture and
                Rural Development. This reaction has taken place throughout the
                United Kingdom and in the Republic of Ireland as well. We see in
                today’s press that the Republic is also gearing up for similar
                types of activity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some local authorities and others are trying
                to fill the gap left by the cancellation of many major events.
                Attempts are being made in Coleraine to put a package together
                to compensate for the loss of the North West 200, which is the
                most obvious and serious cancellation. I support that. It is the
                right thing to do. Activities of that nature, provided they are
                focused on trying to get bed-nights and entertainment for local
                people, are to be welcomed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are naturally focusing on consequential
                compensation, which is understandable in the circumstances. It
                could be of assistance to many businesses. The major solution to
                this problem is not compensation — it is to get our visitors
                back. That is the main objective that we must set ourselves.
                Only when we get our visitors back will we be able to help those
                businesses in a meaningful and long-term way.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our tourism throughput and revenue grew last
                year by approximately 11%. That followed a series of years
                during which growth was enjoyed. A significant amount of
                investment has been made by companies, bed-and- breakfast
                proprietors and chalet owners at the behest of, and with the
                assistance of, the Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It must be remembered that we have been
                appealing for farm diversification for years. People have heeded
                that advice and have diversified, in many cases, into
                resource-based and natural-based tourism and rural development,
                and public funds have been directed to assist that.</p>

                dependence on agriculture, are now under threat. I support the

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was very impressed by the positive approach
                taken last week by the two Committees, as a result of which we
                are able to debate this realistic motion. Farming has been the
                focus of much of the attention in recent weeks, but given the
                Committee’s remit on tourism, I will deal with that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee met with the Northern Ireland
                Hotels Federation. The current forecast is of a 30% reduction in
                bookings for this season. The Chairperson will give other
                statistics. This crisis affects both urban and rural hotels. The
                federation was lobbying for VAT relief, but that will provide
                only short-term cash-flow relief. The more important matter,
                about which it has spoken to the Minister of Finance and
                Personnel, is rates relief.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the meeting that the Minister had
                last week with his tourism Colleagues from other parts of the
                United Kingdom. It is important that we act together as far as
                possible on this. I take on board the point that more people
                must be encouraged to visit our shores, and we will respond to
                that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to emphasise the plight of the horse
                racing industry in Northern Ireland. I met with the officials of
                the Down Royal racecourse. They have not held a race meeting
                since last November, and this has led to job losses and
                financial difficulties. I hope that the Department of
                Agriculture and Rural Development can provide some relief for
                them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I appeal to the Executive to clarify the
                criteria for the return of horse racing to Northern Ireland.
                Will it be the case — as it was in the Republic of Ireland —
                that horse racing could recommence 30 days after the last
                outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease? We need clarification on
                that issue soon or there will be huge problems for the future of
                horse racing in Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was approached recently by coach operators
                throughout the Province. Many of them would normally be
                transporting schoolchildren to various events. However, this is
                not happening. They have no income but still have to pay for the
                maintenance of their buses. Some of them are very concerned
                about the attitude of the financial institutions in Northern
                Ireland towards the problems that they are facing. I plead with
                the Assembly for the Executive Committee, or another Assembly
                body, to meet with the banks in Northern Ireland to see whether
                something can be done to deal with the current crisis.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There have been substantial lay-offs in
                several areas of various industries that have been hit by the
                foot- and-mouth crisis. It would be helpful if we made a case to
                put to the Chancellor of the Exchequer. We should be quantifying
                the number of job losses that are taking place. This is
                important if we want to move forward on the issue.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not need to tell Members that foot-
                and-mouth disease is a common enemy and that every person in
                Northern Ireland has been affected in some way. The ordinary
                person in the street has been affected as well as those who work
                in farming and tourism. It is important now for everyone to
                stand shoulder to shoulder to combat the disastrous effect it
                has had on our economy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is the first crisis that we have faced
                as a new, devolved Government, and the way that we handle this
                matter will set a precedent for the way that we will deal with
                any future crises. The harsh reality is that no one knows, or
                can accurately predict, the long-term impact of foot-and-mouth
                disease or the outcome of the disaster. The real scale of the
                problem for the farming and tourism industries could be
                colossal, and it will have a ripple effect on a large number of
                businesses.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must acknowledge that this is not only an
                economic issue — it is also an equality issue, and we must
                address it as such. One of the main problems is that we do not
                have a hardship fund here, and there is an immediate need to
                establish one as soon as possible. However, decisions such as
                how much money should be diverted into such a fund, and where
                that money should be diverted from, must be made sooner rather
                than later.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We do not want a knee-jerk reaction. We must
                be realistic, because we cannot wave a magic wand and hope that
                the problem will go away. There may be some short and
                medium-term remedies, but we have to look at the overall picture
                and study the long-term effects of foot-and-mouth disease on the
                community and the economy as a whole.</p>

                important that there be solid cross-party support for the
                Executive’s developing an approach that meets the needs of
                those who are affected by the crisis. At the same time, the

                across the board. Will the Assembly direct unallocated funds, or
                can it use end of year flexibility to meet the needs? These
                questions must be carefully considered and answered. The
                Assembly must also have a solution that will use any
                consequential funds from the Treasury as well as existing

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Agriculture and Rural
                Development Committee (Rev&nbsp;Dr&nbsp;Ian&nbsp;Paisley): </b>Last
                Friday the Agriculture Committee met a deputation from the
                Northern Ireland Livestock Auctioneers’ Association.
                Twenty-four firms were represented who operate 30 livestock
                marts. They were led by the chairperson of the association. The
                marts have been closed down by law; they are not like any other
                part of the sad saga that is going on. They are not legally
                allowed to operate, so their losses cannot be described as
                consequential; their losses are a result of the law. I am not
                arguing that the law is not good or right. The auctioneers all
                agreed that this had to be done. The marts could not continue to
                operate as if nothing had happened — they had to close.
                However, the law closed them down, as a result of which the
                auctioneers went completely, totally and absolutely out of
                business. They voiced real concern about the fact that their
                colleagues in Scotland, whom they had met a couple of days
                before, had been told that £13·5 million has been set aside by
                the Scottish Parliament to deal with the foot-and-mouth crisis
                there.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Whether the Department’s actions in closing
                the marts were legal may be tested in the courts because of
                compensation claims. However, that is not what the Committee was
                discussing or that the auctioneers were advocating. The
                auctioneers need to get back in business as soon as they can.
                The losses caused to the marts are immediate and directly
                related to the movement ban and the closures. The chairperson of
                the association estimated that £1 million of income has been
                lost during what is normally the busiest and most profitable
                time of the year. However the marts still have to pay rates. The
                Committee heard of a bill of £36,600 for two marts. In some
                cases the marts must pay rent to local councils; they also have
                overdrafts to service and insurance bills to pay, and the list
                goes on and on. The marts have had to lay off some 400 full-and
                part-time staff, some of whom will be permanently lost to them.
                Redundancies are resulting in further costs to the marts.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The auctioneers are in dire financial
                straits, and members of the Agriculture Committee agree that
                they should be compensated. Members also shared the auctioneers’
                concerns about the future of their sector, because their work
                comes from the stock market of the industry.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is where prices are set; that is where
                the market can be examined and prices given in a competitive
                way. If that is taken away, there will no competitiveness left.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the markets are closed it will strike a
                blow and sever an artery in the local community. In many places
                where the local mart was closed down there was devastation in
                the community — particularly in the business community of the
                town or village concerned.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the opportunity given by the two
                Committees to debate this issue and to ask the Government to
                provide a relief package for all concerned. There are many
                people, across all areas, who are very severely affected by
                foot-and-mouth outbreaks. Many sectors are involved — some
                more than others. Entire businesses are affected, and there is a
                question mark over whether those businesses will have a future
                at all. That has to be taken into account.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Consequential losses are much more severe in
                some cases than in others. In particular, some people, including
                farmers and those who are involved with farming, have moved
                towards tourism as a way of increasing their income. That means
                of income has now been taken from them because of the
                foot-and-mouth situation. Some compensation should be given to
                those people. In particular, compensation should be given to
                businesses that have been almost completely closed, almost
                forced to close — in many instances, businesses have not been
                forced to close completely because they would have had to
                receive compensation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The marts are a case in point. They were
                forced to close. They had no choice. They were not advised, as
                others were, and therefore they need particular compensation for
                their losses. They are still being asked to pay rates and cover
                costs, and they will be asked to increase the amount of measures
                to be put in place before they can reopen. That may mean that
                for some of the marts, particularly the smaller ones, it will
                not be economical to reopen. That will be a severe consequence
                of foot-and-mouth disease for many small communities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most marts, like cattle, are west of the Bann,
                so the impact of the foot-and-mouth crisis is greater there.
                Those farmers have been unable to sell their stock. They do not
                finish beef and, therefore, are not in a position to sell their
                stock directly to meat plants. Those farmers have not had an
                income for a very long time — since the crisis began — and
                they still do not know when they will be able to sell stock and
                get an income. What has been done with regard to farmers’
                welfare and telling them how they can find other ways of earning
                an income in the meantime? A package to deal with those matters
                needs to be put in place, as well as some sort of compensation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the things that has emerged from the
                crisis is the general public’s focus on farming and the
                countryside. Members of the public have given particular
                sympathy to farmers, both here and in Britain. They have had to
                look at the industry as they have never done before. It seems
                that what was happening in farming before the crisis began was
                of little consequence to those outside the industry. The crisis
                has had an impact on those sectors that are outside the farmgate,
                and people have had to listen and take note. They should take a
                greater interest in the quality of the food they eat and the
                future of the farming industry and also in what can be done to
                alleviate this problem and prevent it from happening again.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are people involved in the food sector,
                in producing and processing food, who have lost severely as
                well, people, for instance, in the pork and bacon business who
                exported across the border. They were closed down at the
                beginning of this outbreak. They have been put totally out of
                business and may well not be able to start up again. I know of a
                number in the Fermanagh area, in Tyrone and in some of the
                border counties. Those people have suffered severely and have
                had no one to whom they can voice their concerns. They need to
                be looked at in particular by the IDB or anyone else who can
                possibly help them, because they are going to have severe
                difficulties in expanding their businesses.</p>

                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McClarty:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion. Over recent weeks, my
                Colleagues and I have highlighted with varying degrees of
                expertise and authority the dire consequences of foot- and-mouth
                disease on our farming, tourism and hospitality industries. We
                all know — indeed society at large is only too well aware —
                of the pervading consequences of the crisis for our entire
                economy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With that said, I am sure that most of us
                here have been relatively fortunate and have had limited, if
                any, first-hand exposure to the detrimental effects of this
                virus. It is often from theoretical knowledge that we speak, and
                not from experience. That is why it is imperative that we all
                now get alongside those who have suffered during recent weeks,
                those who have suffered financial loss, hardship or even ruin,
                and those who, through no fault of their own, face economic, not
                to mention psychological, depression.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many people — farmers, hoteliers, those in
                the tourism industry and small business proprietors — are
                experiencing very real pessimism. There are too many people in
                the doldrums of economic insecurity. That is why the time is
                right to show those who have been affected by foot-and-mouth
                disease that we support them in their hour of need. We are
                fortunate that with a devolved Administration we can do just
                that. We must all show solidarity with the people of this
                country who have been, and continue to be, affected.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It would be a tangible and beneficial gesture
                to give affected businesses financial relief measures. While
                such measures would be for discussion at the Executive and at
                central Government level and could include business rates
                relief, I strongly advocate that action be taken sooner rather
                than later. While a financial package of relief would not be a
                panacea for the mounting financial problems of the past two
                months, it would, at the very least, provide a financial
                kick-start to many affected businesses.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support a compensation package that will be
                swift to emerge, cutting in its effectiveness and non-
                cumbersome in its delivery. I have spoken to many people from
                the farming community in my constituency of East Londonderry and
                to many in the tourism and hospitality sectors who were relying
                on the financial boost provided by a successful North West 200.
                These people have very real and immediate insecurities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They, I and all those who have made
                sacrifices, big and small, can only view with horror and disgust
                the few, the greedy, the defrauders, the cheats and the liars
                who have put self first and their fellow citizens and neighbours
                last by flouting the law with illegal animal movements,
                fraudulent claims and lies. They are the guilty — guilty of
                dishonest practice. They have jeopardised the livelihoods of so
                many others. They deserve to be hounded by the law and condemned
                by every single person who has chosen the responsible course of
                action, frequently at personal inconvenience, financial loss or,
                indeed, ruin. Let us not forget those who are the heroes and
                those who are the villains of the foot-and-mouth crisis.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.15 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the motion says, if there is to be a
                hardship relief package, let us not focus solely on those who
                have the wherewithal to make media headlines, but also on those
                who are quietly suffering and who might be anticipating a period
                of despair.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In conclusion, many voices are singing for
                financial assistance during this time of economic hardship. Each
                voice is worthy of being listened to — and must be listened
                to. We have a responsibility not only to hear the parts, but to
                realise the gravity of the tune they sing and to respond
                accordingly. I support the motion.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr ONeill:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I too support the motion. The severe
                hardships of the agriculture industry — and farmers in
                particular — have already been well amplified. Against this
                background, many have reduced incomes, and many have no income.
                Those problems have occurred with increasing regularity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I am sure Members well remember, sheep
                farmers in my area have already endured serious hardship as a
                result of the ban on grazing in the Silent Valley catchment
                area. Can you imagine the hardship that those men and their
                families are now suffering? There is injustice in the fact that
                the infection was not actually caused by sheep but by
                infrastructural deficiency, despite attempts by departmental
                officials to cover this up. What has happened to all these
                people’s requests for compensation?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am also struck by the position of the
                tourist and leisure industry. I am reminded of the great
                hardships they experienced over the last 30 years and their
                resilience and endurance when their businesses — which were
                often based in their own homes — were declared to be economic
                targets, attacked and often destroyed. They have had to battle
                against an increasingly bleak situation and negative publicity.
                Yet, in the Newcastle and Castlewellan area, which I represent
                — often described as the &quot;jewel in the crown&quot; of
                Northern Ireland’s tourist industry — some seaside hotels
                have, in the past, been forced to let their staff take summer
                holidays. This was because the hotel staff were so successful in
                mastering the conferencing trade that they could only take leave
                during the summer. Despite all those hardships, they succeeded.
                Those establishments now tell me that their business, in this
                present crisis, is being reduced by up to 70% in some weeks of
                operational business. There is a particular need to provide
                support for those people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In my area — which, as I said, is a tourism
                area — there are many pony-trekking and horse riding centres.
                I can cite one example, which is very familiar to me, of a man
                who has worked for the last 30 years to build up his business.
                He now has 40 ponies for trekking, but he has not gained one
                shilling of income since the outbreak of this crisis. If anyone
                in the House knows what it costs to keep one horse for one week,
                he should have some idea of the plight of someone who has had to
                try to keep 40 horses for the last six or seven weeks without
                any income. Some people will have reduced income; some of the
                farmers who have suffered will even get compensation, but people
                in this type of situation receive no support — there is no
                hope. He will soon have to sell off everything and close the
                business after 30 years of hard work. If that is not a clear
                example of the need for consequential financial support to
                sustain such people, I do not know what is.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The responsibility to provide that falls on
                the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer. I know
                that our Minister of Finance and Personnel will make strong
                representations to ensure that we get the package of financial
                support that we need, and I was heartened to hear the Minister
                of Enterprise, Trade and Investment correctly identify the
                support that we need to ensure that our businesses regain
                confidence.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Paisley Jnr:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the Easter recess, we were recalled to
                debate an issue that Members on the opposite side of the House
                said was not essential. However, they were able to turn out then
                and pack those Benches. It is a pity that the presence on those
                Benches today does not reflect the urgency of this issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We face a crisis. It is important that the
                Government demonstrate today that they will get a grip on that
                crisis and demonstrate that they have a way forward for the
                entire economy. In the early part of the crisis, policy was
                marked by confusion. One day it appeared that Northern Ireland
                was closed for business; the next the Executive launched a
                multi-million pound tourism initiative. The following day, a
                huge tourist event was cancelled, but events in other parts of
                Antrim were able to proceed. Nothing was done to stop a rave at
                Nutts Corner that attracted about 15,000 people. It is essential
                that such confusion be addressed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The confusion was not just in Northern
                Ireland; there was confusion in the Isle of Man, England,
                Scotland and Wales. There has been no long-term planning for a
                disaster such as foot-and-mouth disease. The United States of
                America runs a foot-and-mouth disaster plan every year, and that
                disaster plan has proved successful; they have not had
                foot-and-mouth disease since 1926 or 1927. Our Government have
                been found wanting in their disaster planning. I hope that they
                will put a disaster planning strategy in place.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members will agree with what Reg Empey said
                this morning. In the medium and long term, we must get visitors
                back to Northern Ireland. We must, however, ask the question
                that was raised by his statement: when the visitors come back
                — next year or later this year — will we have the facilities
                to cater for them? Many people feel that the problems that have
                affected the tourism industry and the catering trade could be
                long-term ones. It is up to the Government to produce a proper
                package of measures that will help us get over the crisis.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The cancellation of the North West 200 has
                cost north Antrim and east Londonderry about £6 million. If
                such an event were to have taken place in Belfast but had been
                cancelled, the loss — adjusted accordingly — would have been
                £50 million. Belfast could not sustain that financial loss, and
                my region should not be asked to sustain its loss without
                adequate compensation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The information supplied in the first few
                days of the crisis was disappointing. Red tape still impedes
                many businesses. We must ensure that we ease the pressure on
                tourism and retail businesses in the most drastically affected
                areas. A regulated impact unit should make a snapshot study of
                what is happening, and the Government should implement the
                findings of that study. I hope that the Minister will consider
                that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Shops, restaurants, hostels, hotels, and
                bed-and- breakfast businesses cannot see any light at the end of
                the tunnel. The Government must throw them something to show
                that there is going to be light at the end of the tunnel. A
                massive tourism and business drive must be initiated, and I
                welcome some measures that have been taken. I hope that the
                Government address the insurance premiums which these businesses
                have to pay, additional rates relief and other imaginative
                programmes to help businesses get out of the problems they face.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In conclusion, we need stopgap compensation
                for regions already hit by the consequences of foot-and- mouth
                disease. My region in Moyle depends on seasonal employment. That
                has gone for good this year, and what is the Government going to
                put in its place?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Gildernew:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Chairperson of the Committee for
                Finance and Personnel and the Chairperson of the Committee for
                Enterprise, Trade and Investment for bringing this motion to the
                House. This is the first time that the Assembly has debated the
                debilitating effect of foot-and-mouth disease on the community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Coming from a farming background, I am
                acutely aware of how badly foot-and-mouth disease has affected
                us all. While the damage to tourism has been severe, the fact
                that the people who live and work here all year have much less
                money to spend on a daily basis has resulted in downturns in
                spending in shops, pubs and restaurants. Indeed, it has often
                been said that when the farmers are doing badly, we are all
                worse off. Their spending power is critical to the economy on
                this island.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fact that a rates rebate has not been
                made available to businesses is a major mistake. While a
                three-month stay of execution will give temporary relief, it
                will only put an additional burden on businesses, as the same
                rates will still have to be paid, albeit later. Businesses
                should have been given a discount on their rates, which would
                help them keep their heads above water — not a cosmetic
                exercise, which will have no real benefit.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While the country has been focusing on the
                farmers’ plight, and rightly so, many other businesses face
                closure and hardship due to this unfortunate outbreak of
                foot-and-mouth disease. I know of one business in my
                constituency, the East Coast Adventure Centre, which has lost
                business in excess of £30,000 a month, has had to lay of staff
                and is facing the prospect of closure.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Gildernew:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank my Colleague for his intervention.
                Many businesses are probably going to go under this year because
                of the impact of foot-and-mouth disease on their revenue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need to be imaginative about how we tackle
                the increase in job losses, which are an additional blow to the
                rural community in Fermanagh and Tyrone. An average farm income
                is usually supplemented by a wage from an outside source.
                However, with so many jobs lost in the textile industry and food
                production, this source of revenue is lost also. A county like
                Fermanagh, which has had to rely on tourism and agriculture for
                the vast majority of its economic revenue, has felt the effect
                of foot-and-mouth disease twice as much as any other county in
                Ireland. In general, the rural community has responded well to
                the needs of the farming community. Organisations like the GAA
                have been extremely responsible and patient as they wait for the
                disease to diminish.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A hardship package is a necessity to
                alleviate the prospect of financial ruin for many people. A
                joined-up approach from all agencies, especially from the
                Minister of Finance and Personnel and the British Chancellor of
                the Exchequer, is required to support the farming community, the
                tourist industry and the rural economy. Measures like organic
                farming, for example, will need to be supported financially to
                increase confidence in the products provided. We must do all in
                our power to help the farmers — the backbone of the rural
                economy — to get back on their feet.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion. Go raibh maith agat.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Armstrong:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I speak on this motion with a heavy heart and
                the utmost sympathy for farmers and their families, who have
                bore the brunt of this foot-and–mouth disease, and for the
                effect it has on wider industry in our Province.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must now take stock of our farmers’
                plight and the knock-on effect in associated agri-food
                operations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The farming industry has yet again been hit
                by a crisis; this time it is foot-and-mouth disease. It is
                important that Members be informed about how the disease came
                about. The first case of foot-and-mouth disease in the United
                Kingdom came at the beginning of February. Sheep were imported
                to be slaughtered, but they were not slaughtered. We must find
                out how those sheep found their way on to unsuspecting farms.
                Had the handling of those sheep been carried out properly,
                Northern Ireland would have fared a great deal better.
                Prevention is better than cure.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.30 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To date, four cases of foot-and-mouth disease
                have been confirmed. In what way has the epidemic impacted on
                Northern Ireland? If Northern Ireland is to legislate properly
                in respect of the disease, we must first give an accurate
                assessment of its effects. As a representative of Mid Ulster I
                have had first-hand experience of the effects of the desperate
                disease. Two of Northern Ireland’s cases to date have occurred
                in Mid Ulster.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Just as the economy of our Province was
                beginning to pick up in the wake of BSE, foot-and-mouth disease
                hit the industry. I would be failing my constituents if I did
                not tell the House of the suffering of the wider rural
                community. Social events have been cancelled, fewer meals have
                been eaten in hotels, and forest parks are shut. Those are just
                a few examples. Sporting fixtures had to be cancelled
                Province-wide, and the burning of cattle has done nothing to
                attract visitors to Northern Ireland. However, we find ourselves
                in an emergency, and it is the Assembly’s duty to lead. The
                Assembly must provide whatever help it can to those worst hit by
                foot-and-mouth disease.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Compensation has rightly been awarded to
                those farmers who have seen their livelihoods destroyed by the
                disease. But what of the wider rural industries affected by the
                disease in our Province? Are they forgotten victims? Rural
                tourism has also been adversely affected in our Province as a
                result of the disease.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Farmhouse and bed-and-breakfast accommodation
                is at a complete standstill. Boat and coach hire companies have
                been decimated by cancellations. Major international events,
                including the Balmoral Show and the North West 200, have been
                cancelled. Tourism is worth over £350 million to the Northern
                Ireland economy, and it employs 38,500 people. The Northern
                Ireland Tourist Board has warned of a £2 million loss due to
                foot- and-mouth disease. The entire tourism infrastructure is
                threatened, and the effects of that will be felt across the
                economy of Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The EU has closed all auction marts, but
                livestock marts are still paying rates. Their rates should be
                frozen until auction marts are back in business. We need to
                ensure that those auction marts are still operational when the
                threat of foot-and-mouth disease has passed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I appeal to the Ministers of Finance and
                Personnel and Agriculture and Rural Development to get their
                heads together. They must provide the best package they can
                muster to help all affected industries — especially the wider
                rural industries — in this time of dire need. The Province is
                on its knees after the BSE crisis, which clobbered farmers with
                disaster. Allow me also make a plea to the Department of
                Agriculture and Rural Development to complete all outstanding
                payments of premium even if it means some element of derogation
                from Europe. I support the motion.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Courtney:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion. Since mid- February
                nightly reports on our televisions have shown the results of the
                foot-and-mouth disease on the farming community, and the
                scarring of the countryside with burial pits and burning pyres.
                That has had a devastating effect on the farming industry and on
                those businesses that are countryside-dependent. As the Minister
                of Agriculture and Rural Development said last week,
                compensation is unfortunately limited to those who have had
                livestock slaughtered or feeding-stuff seized.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Government’s current position is that
                there is no provision or precedent for consequential
                compensation. That also applies to livestock markets. Last week
                Ulster’s premier rural showpiece, the Balmoral Show, was
                called off with an estimated loss of £5 million. That
                cancellation of a three-day event that attracts more than 60,000
                people each year was a severe blow.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Businesses other than the farming industry
                are also affected. The cancellation of major events such as the
                North West 200 will have a negative impact on the local economy
                and cause hardship for many businesses.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In an article last week the chairman of the
                Institute of Directors (IoD), Eric Bell, said that the IoD had
                surveyed UK members at the beginning of April. Thirty-five per
                cent of them responded that their businesses had been affected.
                These include small businesses from farm suppliers to
                bed-and-breakfast establishments. They are all counting the
                cost. Compensation has, quite rightly, come to farmers who have
                lost herds. A rates deferral scheme is operating, and small firm
                loan guarantee schemes have been amended and extended. The
                Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister is
                considering what compensation schemes are required and how they
                may be administered.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The £1&nbsp;million marketing-based tourism
                recovery plan is crucial to future visitor numbers. Recently the
                Enterprise, Trade and Investment Committee met with the Northern
                Ireland Hotels Federation, which gave some stark statistics.
                Losses in tourism are running at three times those of
                agriculture, with a forecasted loss of over £8&nbsp;billion for
                2001. Business is down by 50%. Hotels across the country have
                had a flood of cancellations. Hospitality and tourism employs
                35,000 people across Northern&nbsp;Ireland, with 30,500 employed
                directly in hotels. These people are now being laid off. The
                industry is worth £350&nbsp;million to the
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland economy. The Northern Ireland Hotels
                Federation pressed the Committee for urgent assistance with
                business viability and a marketing strategy to rebuild tourism.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recently hoteliers in Derry and the
                north-west told me that bookings are down dramatically, some by
                up to 75%. Hotels have cut prices, but it is becoming difficult
                to survive as conferences are being cancelled. Easter was
                particularly quiet with only one third of rooms occupied. When
                prices are cut, it is very difficult to get them back to a more
                normal rate. Hotels are also affected in other ways; limited
                supplies for menus mean higher retail prices. All in all it is
                becoming more difficult to operate. The knock-on effect is
                considerable. Every facet of our economy is being affected. A
                broad range of support measures, such as payment deferrals and
                rebates for VAT, rates and other taxes, as well as compensation
                for lost earnings, and interest-free loans is needed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I call on all Departments in the Executive
                and the Chancellor of the Exchequer to ensure that any
                assistance is not dogged by red tape and delay. Swift help is
                needed if Northern&nbsp;Ireland is to recover from the
                foot-and-mouth crisis and tackle the longer term issues which
                will determine our future prosperity. There was an article in
                last night’s ‘Belfast Telegraph’ on a survey carried out
                by PricewaterhouseCoopers. It gave a loss of £200&nbsp;million
                as being the best-case scenario for Northern&nbsp;Ireland. In
                the same paper a guest house owner had written a letter saying
                that he is almost visitor-free due to the foot- and-mouth
                crisis. These are the grim effects. We need a relief package to
                prevent Northern&nbsp;Ireland’s becoming an economic desert. I
                support the motion.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Poots:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is an issue of great concern. Many
                people would say that tourism in my constituency of Lagan Valley
                has not been badly affected, but that is not the case. Lagan
                Valley has the largest horse-racing festival in
                Northern&nbsp;Ireland; the second largest motorcycle race —
                the Ulster Grand Prix; the largest cinema complex; and the top
                leisure swimming pool complex in the United Kingdom. Last year
                25,000&nbsp;tourists used the tourist information centre in
                Hillsborough village.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A recent report from Sir Reg Empey showed
                that some £9&nbsp;million was spent by tourists in Lagan Valley
                over the last year. Tourism is a major business in our community
                in spite of the fact that the constituency does not have seaside
                venues, unlike the constituencies of other Members who have
                spoken. Local businesses are suffering the effects, and many are
                complaining that their trade is down. While many businesses can
                absorb a loss of trade even for a sustained period, others are
                not in such a position. Business is very poor for those who have
                bed- and-breakfast establishments, especially those who offer
                farmhouse accommodation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also have to mention coach operators. They
                are not getting the business, because people do not want to go
                on tourist trips around the Province. Many of the locations that
                they would like to visit are closed. Coach operators are being
                severely hit by the current foot-and-mouth-disease crisis. The
                Executive and the relevant Ministers have to look closely at
                this issue. They have to do something to compensate those people
                for their losses.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also ask that specific reference be made to
                livestock marts, which are a separate case in that they have
                been instructed by the Minister of Agriculture and Rural
                Development to cease trading. That decision has been backed up
                by the European Commission In my opinion, this creates a legal
                question for the Minister of Finance and Personnel, given that
                mart owners still have to pay rates. Something is wrong if one
                Government body says that an individual is not allowed to carry
                out his business, but another charges him a business rate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have a Government which talks a good deal
                about fair treatment and which has equality policies. We also
                hear a good deal about joined-up government — let us see this
                happen. Let the Minister of Finance and Personnel get together
                with the Minister of Agriculture to deal with this issue. Five
                hundred people are employed in the livestock marts. My concern
                is that many marts will not reopen their doors when the
                foot-and-mouth crisis is over. Today in Northern Ireland sheep
                farmers receive for their lambs about half the price received by
                farmers in the Republic of Ireland. Clearly, that is because in
                Northern Ireland there are only four meat plants where lambs can
                be killed. The trade which we would normally have had with the
                Irish Republic has gone.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the livestock marts are not open when
                Northern Ireland gets back to business, the farmers will suffer
                further, because the meat plants will have the monopoly on the
                sheep trade, just as they have dominated the meat trade for the
                last five years since BSE emerged. It is essential that we give
                these people the support that they need to see through this
                crisis. We need to be there when it is over, because it will
                have a major effect on the entire agriculture community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I ask the Minister to take particular note of
                that, but also to examine the situation of coach operators and
                those who offer bed-and-breakfast accommodation. They have been
                hardest hit by the foot-and-mouth crisis. Farmers have been
                badly affected, but although I am from a farming background, I
                must say that the tourist industry and the livestock marts have
                been worst hit. It is imperative that the Minister look at these
                issues and give these people the support they need.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Carson:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am pleased to speak in strong support of
                the motion. The outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease has been
                another crippling blow to the farming community, which is still
                reeling from the consequences of BSE. Those consequences reach
                into every part of our daily lives and into all parts of the
                Province’s economy. Several Members mentioned the plight of
                farmers and the unique problems of the cattle marts. There are
                several marts in my constituency, and something must be done
                directly to help them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today, however, we ask the Minister of
                Finance and Personnel to respond to the crisis outside the
                immediate farming community by providing a financial package to
                alleviate hardship suffered by these farm-related businesses and
                the tourist trade.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In all parts of my constituency, but
                particularly in Fermanagh, tourism has been extremely hard hit
                by cancellations of bed-and-breakfast accommodation, hire
                cruisers and all associated amenities. Thankfully, the fishing
                waters have now reopened, and a slow trickle of tourists is
                returning. The overall loss to the tourist trade, however, has
                been grievous. Everything possible must be done to encourage
                visitors to return. We saw interviews with some American
                tourists who had weird ideas about the effect of foot-and-mouth
                disease on humans. Publicity must be spread further afield to
                counter such ideas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the Minister considers his financial aid
                package, I ask him to look outside the immediate area of tourism
                and to take account of those with ancillary businesses. I speak
                of specialist shops where there has been a drastic drop in sales
                of fishing tackle and accoutrements and outdoor clothing.
                Souvenir shops — even coffee shops — have all lost income.
                The list is endless.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I ask the Minister to encompass businesses
                outside the immediate perceived tourist areas when looking at
                relief packages. As some other Members have pointed out, tourism
                reaches right across Northern Ireland. I have been told of one
                business in south Tyrone that has tackle and tack for sale for
                outdoor pursuits. It has had a huge drop in income — up to
                80%. These business people are the backbone of Northern Ireland,
                and I hope they will not be excluded from any forthcoming relief
                package.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Gallagher:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I too support the motion. We have heard of
                the serious drop in business experienced right across Northern
                Ireland. That is especially true in border areas. In the
                constituency where I live a significant level of business is
                cross-border. Fermanagh and South Tyrone is a constituency which
                has many border crossing points to counties such as Monaghan,
                Cavan, Leitrim and Donegal, so for many businesses a significant
                proportion of trade is cross-border, and many traders there are
                experiencing serious difficulties.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Carson referred to the situation for
                those who operate self-catering enterprises or run guest houses
                or hotels or hire cruisers. There is a strong case for a greater
                response from the Government in view of the difficulties.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Food processing is another sector where
                difficulties are great. That is due to the restrictions imposed
                by the Government on the southern side of the border. I spoke to
                a food processor today who has already lost £50,000 worth of
                business and has had to allow three of his employees to go. I
                spoke to a butcher about a week ago, and he told me that 95% of
                his business was cross-border.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the idea of assistance for the
                traders in difficulties. A number have submitted plans for
                assistance to bodies such as the Northern Ireland Tourist Board
                and LEDU and are asking &quot;What now?&quot; about them. Are
                those agencies taking account of the different and difficult
                circumstances that have obtained since those plans were
                submitted? I urge agencies such as LEDU to be more proactive and
                have a greater presence in the areas that are experiencing the
                greatest difficulties. I see no reason why LEDU and the Northern
                Ireland Tourist Board should not, temporarily at least, open
                offices closer to the problem. Their presence there would act as
                an important link between local businesses and the Government
                Departments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I refer to Government Departments in the
                North and South. If there were a local presence which liaised
                with the Government agencies, it would reassure and restore
                confidence to those affected by the situations I have described.
                LEDU, the Northern Ireland Tourist Board and the Training and
                Employment Agency should be more proactive in providing advice
                and assistance, and this should be dealt with urgently.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Shannon:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion. I want to talk more the
                tourism aspect. According to the figures we received, the cost
                of the crisis to the economy is approximately £200 million.
                When this cost is looked at in the context of the whole
                Province, it gives us an idea of how much everyone has to lose.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">PriceWaterhouseCoopers carried out an
                extensive study into the impact of the crisis on the agriculture
                and tourism sectors. The problem is that the agriculture
                industry, when it did not have problems, diversified into the
                tourism sector. We now have a double whammy, because tourism has
                also been affected by foot-and-mouth disease. The crisis is now
                affecting every aspect of the agriculture economy, not just
                those directly involved in agriculture, but others who suffer
                the ripple effect of foot-and-mouth disease.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report also suggested that the figure
                quoted might reflect a best-case scenario. It stated that the
                eventual cost to the economy could rise beyond £200 million. If
                every high-profile, crowd-pulling, sporting, recreational and
                cultural event continues to be affected, and subsequently
                cancelled, the cost to the economy will spiral. Every
                constituency will feel the pinch.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In my constituency of Strangford, as with
                most other constituencies, we have a very strong rural community
                whose livelihoods depend on agriculture and the diversified
                field of tourism. There is an incredible fear among many people
                in agriculture and other sectors, because they do not know where
                their next pay cheque is coming from. Our farming industry is
                already on its knees, and it seems to be suffering one blow
                after another. Farmers are extremely vulnerable, and they need
                to do everything they can to protect their livelihoods. The
                crisis is now rippling through to other sectors in a virus-like
                way, spreading anxiety throughout the economy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Outside agriculture, the tourist industry,
                which represents 8% of the local economy, is now experiencing
                the very same slump as has been reported on the mainland. The
                crisis on the mainland is more widely publicised through its
                greater PR and bigger headlines. The closure of numerous public
                attractions, including such National Trust properties as Mount
                Stewart, and the cancellation of big events have caused the
                demand for accommodation literally to disappear.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a result, for those farmers who
                diversified into tourism, for example those who set up
                bed-and-breakfast accommodation, the market has dried up. The
                tourism industry in the Kingdom of Down, which covers four
                council areas, is worth between £7 million and £8 million
                annually, and services such as bed-and-breakfast establishments
                face a worrying and uncertain future. The number of bed-nights
                has slumped to an all-time low. To compound their problems,
                tourist organisations face VAT demands which they are simply
                unable to meet. I understand that HM Customs and Excise has made
                some concessions by offering help to farmers and those involved
                in tourism. Despite this, however, it is impossible fully to
                compensate their loss.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To illustrate the plight of some of those
                involved in tourism, a local newspaper reported that a
                guest-house owner who had been in business for more than 40
                years and his colleagues in the same sector had been left almost
                visitor-free by the foot-and-mouth crisis. They fear for the
                future of the industry. How much worse could it get for these
                people? They can make their livings only during the six months
                of spring and summer, and their profits have to take them
                through the winter and early spring. Those people have appealed
                to the Tourist Board, the Executive and the Assembly to
                intervene and help them. The sympathy we feel towards the
                farmers and the agriculture sector should extend to the tourism
                industry, as it is also in difficulty.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The same story applies across the Province,
                not just in the Strangford area. It is very worrying to watch
                the infrastructure that our positive angle on tourism has built
                up over the years dissolve in front of our eyes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This also has an impact on the retail sector
                with regard to goods produced for outdoor and country pursuits.
                As a consequence, from next week, firms in Newtownards that make
                outdoor socks for walking in the countryside will be working a
                three-day week.</p>

                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Savage:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is often public misunderstanding of the
                issues involved in farming. This is probably due to the fact
                that the bulk of the population are now urban dwellers. Nowhere
                is this misunderstanding more apparent than with regard to the
                question of compensation paid to farmers in the wake of the
                foot-and-mouth crisis.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The public needs to understand that
                compensation for the market value of an animal is only the
                beginning. Along with buildings and land, animals are the main
                asset of the farmer, but animals are an active asset which in
                normal times generate income. A farmer’s work in rearing and
                feeding animals represents what we would call &quot;value
                added&quot; in business terms. That is a concept the wider
                public will understand.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A farmer’s income is derived from the value
                he adds to the animals through feeding and nurture and a small
                element of profit in addition. That profit was already eroded
                before the foot-and-mouth crisis. It is a profit margin which,
                in the wake of recent crises such as BSE, has already turned
                into a loss for many farmers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The key point is that the farmer needs to be
                compensated, not only for the market value of the animals he has
                lost, but also for loss of the income he could reasonably have
                expected to earn from those animals in normal circumstances.
                This must also be part of the equation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Furthermore, it is not simply those farmers
                whose herds suffered an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease who
                are affected. Nor is it just those whose land adjoins farms
                where outbreaks have occurred and have had their animals culled.
                The foot-and-mouth outbreak has caused a collapse of normal
                market conditions everywhere. All farmers have been affected,
                not to mention the dependent industries and related businesses
                such as tourism. My Chairperson and many other Members have
                mentioned that the livestock marts have been instructed to close
                by Government officials. Machinery dealers and all industries
                associated with the agriculture industry are affected. As our
                Colleague across the Chamber said, the horse industry is
                practically at a standstill. Top racehorses who have come over
                here to be covered by stallions cannot get back from the stud
                farm to their own farm. The entire farming community has
                suffered losses consequential to the economic displacement
                caused by this epidemic.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the Agriculture Committee on Wednesday 18
                April, the Minister said that such consequential loss would be
                infinite and that it would create huge problems. That may well
                be true. I agree with the Minister that in normal circumstances
                the Northern Ireland block grant could not handle it, but these
                are not normal circumstances.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the most important consequences of the
                present crisis was revealed in a survey in ‘Farming Life’.
                According to that study, one third of the farmers affected by
                foot-and-mouth disease have decided to sell up or to leave the
                industry.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clearly, this is crucial. The unprecedented
                economic dislocation experienced since the first outbreak
                necessitates immediate and urgent consideration to be given to
                an early retirement scheme which I have outlined before in this
                Chamber. Only a scheme of this dimension can handle the
                inevitable restructuring of farming. People, including the
                Government, are only beginning to appreciate the size of the
                agriculture industry. We heard how tourism and interrelated
                industries in Northern Ireland have been affected. I am glad to
                see that the Minister of Finance and Personnel is here today.
                The situation affecting the agriculture industry is so serious
                that there will need to be an imaginative response which marks a
                real departure from the past. We have witnessed the last
                generation of farmers who are prepared to work for nothing.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have had meetings with the Minister, and
                the Department is fully aware of the problems. It realises that
                only a radical response from the Government will do. I hope that
                this compensation package —</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Finance and Personnel (Mr
                Durkan):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Chairperson of the Committee for
                Finance and Personnel and the Chairperson of the Committee for
                Enterprise, Trade and Investment for affording the Assembly the
                opportunity to have this debate. We have had a serious and
                important debate on the implications of the foot-and-mouth
                disease, the threat that it represents to our entire agriculture
                sector and individual farm businesses, as well as the wider
                consequential damage to other sectors, not least — but not
                only — the tourism sector.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive have been alert to all the
                dangers posed by foot-and-mouth disease since its outbreak
                across the water. We know now that we are witnessing the worst
                outbreak of the disease in Britain for a generation. The
                Executive were aware of all the risks from the beginning. We
                have moved decisively — and with all possible speed — to
                protect our vital interests in agriculture and, in turn, to try
                to contend with the difficulties posed for the wider economy. We
                have a clear strategy for trying to achieve this objective.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first priority has been, and will
                continue to be, effective action to contain outbreaks and to
                eradicate the disease. In this way alone will we be able to
                recover the disease-free status that our farmers need. The
                Department of Agriculture and Rural Development has been at the
                forefront of this effort. I pay tribute to the outstanding
                leadership shown by Bríd Rodgers, who has worked ceaselessly
                throughout this crisis. In a subsequent motion today, she will
                have a further opportunity to update the Assembly on the current
                position, and she may address many of the serious issues that
                have been raised by Members in this debate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I stress that the fight against
                foot-and-mouth disease is the responsibility of all Government
                Departments. The Executive have made it clear that the work on
                containment and eradication that has been led by the Department
                of Agriculture and Rural Development will be supported by
                additional personnel and resources drawn from across the public
                sector as necessary. I pay tribute to the support and
                co-operation of all Ministers and their Departments in meeting
                those additional personnel needs. The Office of the First
                Minister and the Deputy First Minister has a role in trying to
                co-ordinate cross-Executive efforts to try to reinforce the hard
                work of the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second prong of the strategy has been to
                get markets moving again, to take effective measures to restore
                confidence in the tourism sector and to try to attract visitors
                back to the region. Central to this effort, as we heard, has
                been the work on the new tourism strategy that was launched on 5
                April by the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment, Sir
                Reg Empey.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Sir Reg Empey explained, the strategy
                injects an additional £1 million in tourism. It will support
                promotions in the US, Canada, Europe and Scotland. The money
                will also be used to provide for more locally centred
                initiatives, including trade and media receptions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Renewed efforts will be made within the
                island of Ireland through television, radio and press to raise
                awareness of the excellent holidays that we offer. As Sir Reg
                Empey emphasised, the most important thing we can do for the
                long-term benefit of tourism is bring the visitors back.
                Customers are the best answer to the problem.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive are well aware that the effects
                of foot-and-mouth disease do not stop at the farmgate. There is
                a wider adverse economic impact from the disease and from the
                measures that have been needed to tackle it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive have set up a task force led by
                the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister
                to monitor the wider consequences of the outbreak. It will also
                consider what feasible and practicable measures would be
                appropriate to support those sectors most affected, taking
                account of local circumstances. That group has links to the
                rural task force in Great Britain to ensure that Northern
                Ireland benefits from any initiatives that are taken in Great
                Britain.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Steps have already been taken to help
                businesses adversely affected. Customs and Excise and the Inland
                Revenue are working together and taking a sympathetic approach
                to deferring payment of tax for businesses suffering financial
                problems as a result of foot-and-mouth disease. No interest will
                be charged for any period of deferral. In addition, all possible
                steps are being taken to speed up VAT repayments to farmers to
                aid their significant cash-flow difficulties.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Further aid is available through the
                Department of Trade and Industry’s small firms loan guarantee
                scheme, which has been specially extended to help businesses
                affected.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I announced on 15 March that the Rates
                Collection Agency would enter into agreements with any business
                facing hardship because of foot-and-mouth disease to defer rates
                payments for up to three months. That help has been put in place
                very quickly and is assisting a number of hard-pressed cases.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I take issue with the suggestion that any of
                the deferment schemes — rates, VAT or others — are mere
                cosmetic exercises. They are measures that we have been able to
                take within available discretion. Given the limit to other
                measures, those measures should be recognised as welcome
                initiatives.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These measures provide a breathing space for
                businesses adversely affected by foot-and-mouth disease.
                However, the Executive have also been acting over the past weeks
                to ensure that more is done and that more measures are taken to
                give effective relief in cases of hardship.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive’s general approach to
                hardship relief is guided by the principle, reflected by many
                Members today, that businesses here should be supported in as
                beneficial a way as businesses in Great Britain. The picture
                there is changing, and there are variations in the approach
                taken in different areas across the water. Members are also
                aware that the legislative framework available to us is
                different in both character and detail from that in Great
                Britain.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We cannot simply introduce the same rate
                relief scheme as has been introduced in Britain, because the
                statutory basis for operating such a scheme does not exist in
                Northern Ireland. I know that it has been suggested that we
                could get the statutory basis if we legislated by means of
                accelerated passage. Notwithstanding the possibility of
                accelerated passage, our legislative regime is not the same as
                Great Britain’s, given the implications of the equality duty
                and the need to go through the full period of consultation. Any
                rate relief scheme that we introduce on that legislative basis
                would require secondary legislation as well as primary
                legislation, therefore it could not be achieved as readily as
                some Members might want it to be or assume that it could be.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On 12 April, the Executive remitted the
                Department of Finance and Personnel, the Department of
                Agriculture and Rural Development and the Department of
                Enterprise, Trade and Investment to make proposals for a scheme
                of a similar nature and with an effect similar to Great Britain’s
                scheme. Those Departments are working on a range of options
                which will be considered by the Executive as a matter of
                urgency. When decisions have been made, the details will be
                announced as soon as possible. The work that is being done by
                the three Departments will be presented to the Executive by the
                task force, chaired by the Office of the First Minister and the
                Deputy First Minister, which is dealing with the economic issues
                created by foot-and-mouth disease.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Wells:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is there to be a form of rates moratorium or
                a general consequential loss package? In my constituency, there
                are businesses that are about to go to the wall but who pay very
                low rates — some are run from home. Some of these businesses
                face hundreds of thousands of pounds of loss. Is the package
                that the Minister proposes simply a way of reducing the rate
                burden, or is it a wider consequential loss package that will
                identify the top 20% to 30% of affected businesses and provide
                compensation for the huge losses that they have incurred?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I refer the Member to my earlier point that
                we have concentrated on as many people as this debate has made
                reference to. We have tried to ensure that the benefits that we
                make available to businesses in Northern Ireland are comparable
                to those extended to affected businesses across the water. Many
                Members have referred to questions about rates, therefore that
                is the matter that I have been addressing.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr Ian Paisley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Minister know anything about the
                £13·5 million that the Scottish Parliament has set aside for a
                compensation package?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Different measures and criteria are being
                employed by the devolved Administrations in Scotland and Wales
                as well as the different councils in England. We are aware of
                different amounts of money that have been announced as part of
                packages and schemes. We are putting forward a case to the
                Treasury based on our need for additional resources to help us
                alleviate the effects and consequences of foot-and-mouth
                disease. The funds are to be used not only to alleviate the
                consequential difficulties faced by different businesses, but to
                cover the considerable costs of contending with the disease. We
                are continuing to put pressure on the Treasury to ensure that we
                receive a full and fair share of the moneys that are made
                available from the contingency reserve.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department has had contact with the
                Treasury. On the basis of that, we are confident that any scheme
                developed here which has similar effects and delivers similar
                benefits to those that are being run across the water will be
                the subject of a read-across of extra money to us. That does not
                mean that we will be paid the full cost of any scheme that is
                adopted. I therefore ask Members to be realistic in that regard.
                The Assembly cannot come up with any scheme, at any cost, and
                automatically get the money from the Treasury. Many Members have
                made the point that more resources are needed from the Treasury.
                In reality, while Members can agree that the Treasury should
                listen to that case, there is no guarantee that it will.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In those circumstances and within the limits
                of what is available to us, we must explore how best we can
                assist the cases of hardship, and that is what the Department is
                trying to do. In his opening remarks, the Chairperson of the
                Committee for Finance and Personnel said that the money should
                not be coming out of the block grant. Many Members have said
                that that case should be made to the Treasury. We could face
                circumstances where little addition is made to our existing
                block grant for these needs. There is no guarantee that the
                Department of Finance and Personnel and the First and Deputy
                First Ministers’ representations to the Treasury will deliver
                as much as Members would like. In that instance the Department
                must decide how it can fund the measures we want to implement to
                mitigate the effects of this emergency on businesses. We will
                not be able to compensate for all of the trading difficulties
                and losses that different business sectors are suffering. We can
                try to mitigate the effects as they impact on particular sectors
                and localities. Therefore we are looking at options aimed at
                doing that. Obviously, as Sir Reg Empey indicated, the Executive
                are trying to look at other means of assistance that can be
                given to businesses by way of support and information.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Allow me to answer points that were made at
                the end of the debate. This issue is not just about the amount
                of money that might be made available; it is also about the way
                in which services and support are provided across the range of
                public sector agencies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Particular reference was made to the
                livestock marts. Many Members stressed that the livestock marts
                are a case apart, because, effectively, they are closed by order
                of law. That is a factor that the Executive are sensitive to,
                and, as Minister of Finance and Personnel, I am alert to. The
                Executive will be considering it fully.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I recognise the severe effect of
                foot-and-mouth disease on the entire economy and on the
                agriculture and tourism sectors in particular. Both sectors are
                central to our present and future economic strength. We cannot
                afford a major downturn. Members have cited the figure from
                PricewaterhouseCoopers of £200 million that appeared in the
                newspapers. While that includes the effects of other factors
                such as the downturn in trends in the world economy, as well as
                foot-and-mouth disease, the Executive recognise that we must
                respond as effectively as we can. However, we must take account
                of the statutory limitations that prevented us from taking those
                steps that some people wanted us to take before now. We must
                also realise that if our efforts with the Treasury do not
                deliver the additional moneys we want, we may face financial
                limitations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to make sure that the concerns that
                have been reflected in this debate are fully reflected by the
                Executive when we consider the sort of measures and package to
                be put together. It is very useful that the debate has coincided
                with the Executive’s considerations. The mandate that we
                received predated this motion. The Executive’s considerations
                are not being prompted by the motion, but they will be assisted
                and enlightened by the useful points that have been made.</p>

                the Chairperson of the Finance and Personnel Committee, Mr
                Francie Molloy, and the Deputy Chairperson of the Enterprise,
                Trade and Investment Committee, Mr Sean Neeson. They praised the
                joint-Committee and cross-party approach to the motion and said
                that it was an effective way to move on the severe hardship that
                is being felt throughout the Six Counties.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and
                Investment, Sir Reg Empey made a very pertinent point in his
                submission. He said that the focus was on getting visitors back
                and getting the industry back on its feet. He also said that
                last year there was an 11% growth in the industry. I commend his
                efforts last week when he met his counterparts in Scotland,
                Wales and England to try to get the tourist industry back on its
                feet.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion focuses on the immediate need for
                a hardship relief package. This is not only an issue for the
                business industry but for farm-related businesses too. The
                financial burden of a hardship relief package must lie with the
                Chancellor of the Exchequer. However, the Minister of Finance
                and Personnel, and the Executive collectively, must request such
                a package of him.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Francie Molloy said that the crisis is not
                confined to the farms — it is much more widespread. He said
                that we must regenerate grants for farm businesses beyond the
                farmgate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Sean Neeson spoke of a 30% reduction in
                bookings in hotels for this season and of the need for
                clarification of the criteria that will used in the horse racing
                industry when it returns to normal.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister spoke of the need to bring the
                industry back to growth, of his efforts to do so — there was
                an 11% growth last year — and of the need, which has been
                ongoing for a number of years, to diversify beyond farming
                itself and into tourism.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Lewsley spoke of the overall, long-term
                picture and of how we must carefully consider the allocation of
                funds.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Ian Paisley focused on the facts that, by
                law, marts are closed down, that the Scottish parliament has set
                aside £3·5 million pounds to deal with these losses and that
                the marts have already laid off 400 full-time and part-time
                staff.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Gerry McHugh focused on farmers west of the
                Bann, on how they have had no income since the foot-and-mouth
                outbreak started and on how they cannot sell their animals.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">David McClarty spoke of the need to provide
                financial relief measures sooner rather than later.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Eamon ONeill mentioned horse riding and pony-
                trekking and highlighted the case of one person who has 40
                ponies to look after, with absolutely no income. He said that
                the burden must fall on the Prime Minister and the Chancellor.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ian Paisley Jnr spoke of the need for a
                disaster plan and for the Executive to focus on bringing such a
                strategy forward. Michelle Gildernew felt that it was a major
                mistake that only a rates rebate was being given; she felt that
                much greater relief was needed and that there should be a
                discount.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Billy Armstrong mentioned the effect on the
                38,000 people who are employed in tourism. Annie Courtney spoke
                about compensation’s being limited to those whose livestock
                had been culled or whose feedstuff had been taken, and she
                mentioned that tourism was suffering at a ratio of three to one
                when compared to farming — an issue that needs to be dealt
                with.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Edwin Poots focused on bed-and-breakfast
                establishments and farm bed-and-breakfast establishments in
                particular. He made the point that sheep farmers here are
                receiving half the compensation that such farmers are receiving
                in the South. Joan Carson spoke of the need for publicity to
                feature the fact that we are open for tourism and to explain the
                real effects of foot-and-mouth disease, as opposed to the phoney
                ones on which some media commentators, particularly in America,
                have been focusing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Tommy Gallagher spoke about the food
                processing industry; the loss of £50,000 in some businesses; a
                case where staff had been laid off; and the ongoing effect on
                the industry. Jim Shannon spoke about cutbacks in stocks and the
                fact that many companies were going on a three- day week —
                something that needs to be alleviated.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">George Savage referred to the knock-on
                effects beyond the farmgate on machinery dealers and all
                businesses associated with farming. He pointed out that the
                block grant was simply not enough. Mark Durkan made a number of
                points, perhaps too many to enumerate. He did say that the
                Executive were working on measures for hardship relief, that all
                Departments were involved and that they were putting a case for
                a fair share of the contingency reserve. Earlier today I spoke
                with the Minister of Education, who informed me that fishing and
                tackle shops were also experiencing severe cutbacks.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On April 3, the Enterprise, Trade and
                Investment Committee interviewed the Northern Ireland Hotels
                Federation. We had 44 pages of evidence dealing with its plight.
                I will read an extract to highlight that. Mr F Mooney said</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Since the outbreak of foot-and-mouth
                disease in Ireland many hotels, particularly city hotels, have
                experienced a dramatic downturn in the number of conferences …
                being booked. The city hotels seemed to be bearing the brunt of
                cancellations in the initial period. As the tourism season
                unfolds for tourist-based properties, the industry is
                forecasting the possibility of a 30% reduction in bookings. The
                ability to maintain the present quorum of people employed in the
                industry has yet to be finally assessed. However, many people
                are indicating that to get them through the current season they
                are looking at either reducing working hours from 40 to 30 hours
                or reducing their staff complement by 10% or 15%.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have come through a period of preparation
                for business in Northern Ireland. We have invested in training
                our staff and in improving our product, and at present we are in
                a very vulnerable state. If we cannot manage the revenue streams
                coming in, the cost centres must be looked at. Some of the cost
                centres are at the rateable valuation of the properties, PAYE,
                VAT et cetera. Those are some of the tax burdens that, with
                help, we can alleviate over the next six months.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I sit on a number of committees that
                represent industry in both the North and the South. The picture
                in the South is no better. Even though it is a developed tourism
                destination, the message that has been given to people thinking
                of holidaying in Ireland is ‘Not this year — come back and
                think about Europe next year’. For long-haul destinations in
                particular the hotel industry is forecasting a 50% reduction in
                bookings. It is forecasting that June, July and August will be
                very poorly affected. The tour operators who are running niche
                market activities such as fishing, golfing et cetera are all
                very badly affected.</p>

                families and the wider rural community in responding to the
                Executive’s policies and guidance regarding foot-and-mouth
                disease, and calls on the Minister of Agriculture and Rural
                Development and her Executive colleagues to act to alleviate
                these difficulties as quickly and imaginatively as possible.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Savage, the Deputy Chairmperson of the
                Agriculture and Rural Development Committee, will reply to this
                debate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While the statements made by the Minister to
                the Assembly on Monday mornings are very welcome, they offer
                only a limited opportunity for questions, and we felt that such
                a crucial issue should be the subject of a full-scale debate —
                bearing in mind the debate this morning.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Throughout this crisis the Committee for
                Agriculture and Rural Development has met with the Minister each
                week. The one exception was when we took a written update to
                hear the most up-to-date position on the foot- and-mouth
                outbreaks and to express our constituencies’ views on the
                Minister’s handling of the crisis. During these meetings a
                wide variety of topics were discussed, and it was clear that
                Members wished to see tight controls in place, both to keep any
                further infection from entering Northern Ireland and to ensure
                that the virus was contained. At times Members have questioned
                the Minister’s policies — not to indulge in political point-
                scoring but in a genuine attempt to understand the issues — to
                ensure that constituencies’ concerns are aired and to provide
                a focus of accountability to the public. That is part of the
                role of a departmental Statutory Committee.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members have also shared the Minister’s
                anger at those who have brought this plague upon Northern
                Ireland. I do not wish to concentrate this debate on a
                denunciation of those involved, because the general public has
                already denounced them. I trust that they will soon be brought
                before the courts and receive severe sentences. My Committee and
                I want to see relief for the many innocents who are suffering
                severely. Throughout the Committee’s deliberations there has,
                quite understandably, been an emphasis on the needs of the
                farmers. Members have called for action on regionalisation,
                direct compensation for slaughtered animals, swift and
                uninterrupted payment of subsidies to farmers and consideration
                of the seasonal realities being faced by farmers with regard to
                feeding and moving livestock. All members of the Committee have
                received distressing telephone calls and letters and have been
                met by deputations of people who are really suffering.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will give the Minister a summary of the
                most pressing matters that have been put to the Committee.
                Movement licences do not apply to many farms, especially beef
                and sheep farms where the sheep are on the fields and cattle
                cannot be let out. On welfare grounds, we need an urgent
                solution — when I say urgent, I mean it with all my heart and
                soul. Farmers could be sued for not treating their animals
                according to proper welfare standards, but they have no other
                option, because they cannot get them out into the fields. That
                is an urgent matter, and I trust that the Minister will make a
                response on that today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many farmers have had no income for the last
                nine weeks. Farm-to-farm sales must be started immediately.
                Subsidy payments must be speeded up; delays in payment are
                unacceptable, particularly in this crisis. The IACS forms are
                impossible to complete, as farmers cannot say whether they will
                be able — or allowed — to rent land or purchase livestock. I
                trust that the Minister will take that on board. Rather than
                adding further costs to the farmer, the Department of
                Agriculture and Rural Development should meet veterinary costs
                associated with animal movement licences. The Minister has
                suggested the end of August as the end of the timetable for
                registration. That is unacceptable. Stores of milk products are
                building up. We need to resume lamb sales to France, and blood
                tests should be a priority. That is a summary of what farmers
                are saying to us.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee has begun to consider the
                lessons that we must learn for farming policy and has already
                made recommendations to the Department’s vision group,
                including the registration of livestock dealers and the
                introduction of electronic tagging for better traceability. I
                have corresponded with the Minister, sending her details
                provided by an expert in foot-and-mouth disease, who says that
                it is a great disappointment that in the United Kingdom —
                including this part — there is no central strategy for dealing
                with a foot-and-mouth outbreak. That lack of preparation has
                left us trusting to luck for the prevention of a major
                foot-and-mouth outbreak. It is also in sharp contrast to the
                attitude of foot-and-mouth disease-free countries.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The USA has not had an outbreak since 1929
                — why is that? In the last decade, the US Government have run
                three foot-and-mouth control exercises, involving the Department
                of Agriculture, the army and the civil defence forces. The whole
                country was alerted to what could happen, and there was a
                strategy to deal with it. Unfortunately, we had nothing of that
                kind.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee has also acknowledged the
                suffering in other sectors. The food processing industry,
                livestock marts, the tourist and hospitality industry and event
                organisers are among those who received specific mention. The
                Committee has ensured that the difficulties faced by those
                sectors were also referred to the Minister, and she has heard
                from members of the Committee about the effect on those sectors.
                In passing, I will mention the livestock marts, about which I
                spoke at some length in a previous debate. They are a special
                case, and I have referred it to the Minister. She knows my
                position — and that of others — on the matter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that there will be news to alleviate
                the great fears about the complete closure of that sector of the
                industry. We heard in the previous debate today that there is to
                be a hardship relief package to take account of falling incomes.
                However, we must also look beyond this. Through this motion, the
                Deputy Chairperson and I hope that Members who have rural
                interests at heart will make constructive suggestions on how to
                bring about the long march towards the recovery of farming and
                the whole rural economy. We also need a constructive response
                from the Minister. Rural communities are looking to the Minister
                and to this Assembly for signs that their way of life will not
                be lost and that hope for the future remains.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are interested in the buying-out scheme
                that has been launched by the Dutch Government under which
                surpluses that have built up as a result of foot-and-mouth
                disease can be taken up. Could a similar scheme be operated in
                Northern Ireland so that the Government could take over these
                animals?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would also like to mention to the Minister
                that in the Report of the Committee of Inquiry on Foot-and-Mouth
                Disease 1968, Part Two, it is stated that</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Burial of carcasses is preferable to
                burning. When burning is unavoidable there is as yet no better
                means than making a pyre than with coal and wood&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is it the view of the Minister’s Department
                that burial is preferable to burning? Would she like to comment
                on that?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is a time of crisis for us, especially
                because our economy, unlike the economy of Scotland, Wales or
                England, is an agricultural economy. If farming does well, the
                country does well. If farming goes down, the country goes down.
                If farming fails, the country fails, and so we have a
                responsibility to see that this industry does not go down, that
                it is not lost to us, that there is a future for the young
                people who want to engage in it and that there is a comfortable
                retirement for those who have borne the burden and the heat of
                the day. It is a difficult time and a time of crisis, but
                mountains are made to be climbed up and over. We have to face
                this mountain, and by the help of Almighty God I believe that we
                will get over the top of this peak.</p>

                accordingly. My aim is obviously to facilitate as many Members
                as possible, because there is great demand from Members to speak
                on this motion. The Business Committee has restricted the length
                of the debate to two hours, and this is why Members’ speeches
                must be limited to five minutes.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker.
                The Northern Ireland public is becoming increasingly and acutely
                aware that, as Mr Bradley said, major issues are being given a
                very miserly length of time for discussion by this Assembly,
                which sits two days a week and which is now on short time. I
                believe that on some occasions we are now starting at 12 o’clock
                instead of at 10.30 am. On behalf of the House, it should be
                brought to the attention of the Business Committee that it is
                not good enough.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That was going to be my suggestion. That
                issue should be brought up by the Member’s representative on
                the Business Committee.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr Ian Paisley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker. I
                delivered my speech as quickly as possible. I do not want people
                to go out and say that Ian Paisley hogged the time.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Leslie:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will use my four and a half minutes to
                address the future rather than dwell on the current problems,
                which have been well outlined by Dr Paisley and which I trust
                the Minister is acutely aware of. When we know how long the
                markets will remain closed, we will know what the cost of the
                crisis will be to the producing farmer. It is hard to quantify
                now.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, it is clear that farm-related
                businesses have suffered an immediate and severe impact.
                Depending on when a reasonably priced market returns to Northern
                Ireland, it may turn out that farm-related businesses suffer
                more than those farmers whose stock is unaffected by the
                disease. It should be borne in mind that immediately before the
                Cushendall and Ardboe outbreaks, lamb prices were quite strong.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Looking ahead, it seems that the message is
                the same as it has been every time that Members have looked at
                this issue in the Chamber — production in the farming sector
                must fall. Current production levels are not sustainable by the
                markets to which they are being taken. The likelihood,
                therefore, is that the amount of land in production will fall
                and the number of farmers farming that land will fall as it was
                doing prior to the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease. My
                Colleague, Mr Savage, will talk about the farmers’ retirement
                scheme in that context.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is difficult to see how significant
                changes can take place without a complete review of the common
                agricultural policy (CAP). I am relieved to see that Germany has
                started to come around to our point of view on this matter. That
                might change the balance of power in negotiations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If one looked at Northern Ireland’s land
                and climate and asked what type of farming should be carried
                out, the shape of the industry would be different to the one
                that exists, which is heavily influenced by the incentives
                provided by subsidies. There is a considerable belt of
                countryside in Northern Ireland where the warm, wet climate is
                ideal for the nursery stage of the horticulture industry in
                which Northern Ireland is scarcely engaged at present.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">New Zealand abolished subsidies and as a
                consequence discovered that a great deal of the product that it
                had been producing had not been making the best use of the land
                and climate. That took 10 to 15 years to emerge. There are
                lessons there for Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In that marginal land — and I reflect on my
                own constituency of North Antrim, with its north coast and the
                Glens of Antrim — it is essential that any future plans
                involve an integrated approach between the planning authority
                and rural development. I would like to see planning policy
                favouring farm diversification at the expense of irrelevant and
                damaging development. Sometimes that relationship is
                misunderstood.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In England it is virtually impossible to get
                planning permission to build a new dwelling in the countryside.
                That is why farm conversions are so popular. When one goes to
                the highlands of Scotland one will see scarcely any new
                buildings. The Scots are preserving the integrity of the
                landscape, because that is the amenity that attracts the
                visitors. If we permit widespread development along the
                coastline, we will cut the farmer off at the knees, because he
                might wish to enter the bed-and-breakfast industry by converting
                buildings for accommodation use.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In reality, that is more expensive than new
                build. Developers can completely overdevelop our coastline, and
                they are detracting from its aesthetic attraction. If we are not
                careful we will cut out the opportunity for diversification
                before we are able to consider it properly. I continually draw
                this matter to the attention of the Minister of the Environment.
                Finally, there are good prospects for farm-based enterprises,
                but the prospects are less good for farming-based enterprises.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion. By the end of the
                debate I hope that the ongoing additions to the financial
                problems of our farmers as a result of foot-and-mouth disease
                will have been highlighted to maximum effect. I hope that we
                will get the necessary attention needed to resolve the crisis
                being experienced by this sector of rural society. The motion
                calls on the Executive to play its part in the compensatory
                programme that, I hope, will be advanced as a result of our
                deliberations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to direct my opening remarks to the
                Minister for Social Development and the role that his Department
                has to play in providing part of the solution that is needed
                urgently. Following the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease and
                the related financial problems that came in its wake, the
                build-up of hardship has brought a new and wider dimension to
                the stress being experienced in farming households. The
                financial problems have now escalated into those of social need.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The problems being experienced in recent
                months on our farms due to lack of working capital have now been
                overtaken by the lack of ready cash needed to put bread and
                butter on the table and for making essential everyday purchases.
                The outdoor cash crisis on the farm has now entered the family
                home. It has become a major issue, and the Social Security
                Agency has an immediate and significant role to play. I was
                encouraged to read the agency’s commitment in its declared
                objectives in the ‘Strategic and Business Plan for 2001-04’.
                The agency’s main aim is written in large bold print in the
                centre of page 11. The agency aims to give</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The RIGHT support to. The RIGHT people
                at. The RIGHT time. EVERY TIME.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It goes without saying that farmers fit into
                that category perfectly. Therefore, I call on the Minister for
                Social Development to put together a team of advisers
                immediately who will visit farming families in difficulties and
                advise them about the level of help on offer from the
                Department. Traditionally, farmers have had little or no contact
                with social security offices. Many of them would not even know
                where the nearest local office is, or the role that it plays
                towards those in need.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On page 39 of the ‘Strategic and Business
                Plan’ — in the section on service standards — the agency
                offers to provide at least one telephone number to deal with
                related enquiries to its offices. I suggest that a helpline for
                farmers — if one does not already exist — might be worth
                consideration.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is difficult for those who are removed
                from the current problems on our farm holdings to comprehend
                fully the stress in the family home when the farmgate is closed
                and when the doors are locked for the night. The absence of
                ready cash is impossible for those who do not have the problem
                to understand fully. In normal times it was no problem to
                provide money for children’s school trips, and there was
                always money available to respond to a &quot;top-up&quot; call
                from a student son or daughter who was living away from home, or
                for prescriptions to meet the family’s medical requisites. In
                other words there was always a &quot;roughness&quot;, as they
                say in the country, to meet the foreseen and unforeseen needs of
                the day. It is to be regretted that those days are gone, and it
                is the Government’s duty to step in to bridge the gap until
                the current agri-financial crisis is resolved.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I apologise for the repetition of this issue
                following the questions and answers yesterday during questions
                to the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development and this
                morning’s debate and questions by other Members. However, the
                foot-and-mouth outbreak is very relevant to the motion. First,
                the ever-increasing financial difficulties faced by our
                livestock marts have arisen directly because of the initial
                closure ban following the foot-and-mouth outbreaks, which was
                firmed up by an EU Directive. Nobody can challenge these
                understandable bans, but by the same token nobody can say that
                the enforced closures were other than as a direct result of the
                foot-and-mouth outbreaks. I contend that compensatory claims
                cannot, and should not, be fitted into the consequential loss
                category. The Minister of Finance and Personnel said that he
                would address this issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I suggest a pro-rata reduction on the rates
                bill matched to the open and closed days of the marts. Perhaps
                the banks could also play a part by putting a freeze on interest
                charges. Secondly, the Executive should, if necessary, seek
                assistance from the Chancellor of the Exchequer to finance the
                cost of the private veterinary licences required by farmers
                prior to moving livestock. There is absolutely no way in which a
                farmer should be charged for complying with this directive or
                for co-operating with it as required.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My third point is not directly related to a
                foot-and- mouth compensation package. It is, more or less, a
                gentle reminder to the Executive that the many problems which
                existed before the foot-and-mouth crisis are still there and
                should not get lost in the commotion. I am concerned, for
                example, that the County Down fishermen, the potato growers or
                the Silent Valley sheep farmers might feel that their problems
                are being forgotten about during this problematic period. I seek
                assurances from the Executive on their behalf.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In conclusion, my opinion is that the
                greatest problems for the cash-strapped industry is the
                difficulty of getting the true situation fully appreciated and
                the need for greater communications from the powers that be.</p>

                too must complain about being confined to five minutes. The
                Business Committee should have allocated three hours to this
                debate. It has allowed three hours for debates on lesser
                subjects.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this
                issue, but we can barely touch on the subject because of the
                time limit. We can try to get only a few points across, and I
                resent that. We must ask why we are in this situation. That is
                more important than targeting particular groups or individuals
                who are perceived to be to blame for bringing the problem into
                the country. The problem is a result of the push by
                multinational companies and others for low prices. That issue is
                not local; it is a global one. We have to grapple and deal with
                it. Do we want people outside this country to produce the food
                we eat, or do we want it produced here where there are proper
                traceability systems? Do we rely on multinationals to bring in
                our food from wherever with minimal labelling? Members should go
                to the shops and try to read from the labels where the food
                comes from. It is impossible. I have looked — and not only in
                this country. This relates to the push for profit and global
                control of food and everything else by large conglomerates.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Tesco made a great noise about its £1
                billion profit and how well it managed its position in the face
                of farmers who have made absolutely no profit in the last few
                years. While Tesco would say in its defence that its profit was
                not only from food, that is what brings people into its
                supermarkets. It relies largely on that. In looking at what it
                can do to leave us with a base industry, it has a part to play
                in the current situation and in the future. It can have quality
                raw material here, instead of working with ever larger outfits
                and turning to other countries which neither have nor intend to
                have traceability.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I disagree with the opinion that farms should
                become smaller. Compared to those in Brazil, for example, they
                are already small. I quote from the ‘Farmers Journal’</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Is our insistence on keeping food
                prices artificially low as bad for the entire country as it is
                for the future of family farms? What is the effect on our health
                and the fabric of Irish society of the ever more intensive
                farming methods that are necessary to keep prices low enough to

                type of food production we want. Do we want quality food, or do
                we want to put up with what we have had? In the years to come,
                do we want more outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease, more
                instances of BSE? We are at that point.</p>

                Fisheries and Food (MAFF) allowed the situation to arise in

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">MAFF had an opportunity two years ago to
                install a state-of-the-art computer system which could trace and
                tackle foot-and-mouth disease. It was an idea from New Zealand
                inspired by the concept of stopping the disease before it became
                an outbreak. The computer system was not installed, and the
                money was put elsewhere. GB farm organisations are saying that
                — it is not something I am dreaming up. That is where the
                blame lies. MAFF therefore needs to compensate us. It is for the
                British Government to look into the matter, deal with it and pay
                for the consequential losses. Government policy failure at top
                level is the reason for our present predicament.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ford:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall endeavour to follow the Chairperson’s
                lead and keep my comments brief. I do not intend to repeat all
                that has been said so far, but I must refer to the issue raised
                by the Committee Chairperson — the matter of the livestock
                traders, the Northern Ireland Livestock Auctioneers’
                Association — who have been closed down by Government order
                and who have yet to receive any compensation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Mr&nbsp;Leslie has already hinted, some of
                the greatest losses are not being suffered on ordinary farms.
                With the price for milk there is enough suffering on farms that
                are relatively closed and away from the current disease
                outbreak. There are particular problems for those who have
                engaged in farm diversification activities and who have followed
                the advice given by the Department of Agriculture over the
                years. In some senses they are now suffering and would have been
                in a better situation if they had not taken that advice but had
                confined themselves to the ordinary pattern of farming. Most
                farm diversification involves a close interaction with people
                off the farms, whether it is a farm shop bringing people onto
                the farm; the provision of bed-and-breakfast accommodation,
                perhaps through the conversion of redundant buildings; or
                provision of other visitor facilities such as an open farm,
                pony-trekking or even quad bike driving. All these activities
                involve bringing people onto the farm and create greater
                difficulties than if the farmer had confined himself to
                traditional farming activities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It seems illogical that those who are
                suffering most are those who have followed the advice from the
                Department and have invested in alternative enterprises in order
                to maintain farm income and keep younger members of the family
                employed in the countryside. They have perhaps gone to the bank
                and borrowed heavily. In some cases, however, they have not even
                needed to do that to be in difficulties. Those people have done
                what they have been asked to do — provided employment and
                enhanced the rural infrastructure. They are keeping people in
                the countryside and keeping shops, facilities and schools open,
                and yet they are the ones who now face the greatest threat and
                the potential of closure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Farming activities have maintained some level
                of income, although not what they should, especially for those
                whose cattle go over-30 months, those who are presently trying
                to sell sheep in Northern Ireland or those who are faced with
                the commodity price of milk. It is ironic that it is those who
                have sought to diversify, to be progressive and to provide job
                opportunities who are faced with these problems. That is why
                there must be a case for consequential compensation, and it must
                be answered by Ministers responsible to the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the end of the debate I have no doubt that
                the Minister will tell us that she and the Minister of Finance
                and Personnel have limited funds available. That is correct, and
                that is why we must support any pressure applied by the
                Executive to the Chancellor of the Exchequer who has his
                billions stockpiled for his pre-election boom, whenever he
                chooses to bring that about. Compensation for the foot-and-mouth
                outbreak will be a small share of what he made from selling
                mobile phone licences over the last 12 months.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There must also be a case for saying that we
                need to examine what is available in our budgets. I forget how
                many times between Christmas and the end of March the Minister
                of Finance and Personnel announced that he had found an extra
                few million pounds in his back pocket. There must be a case for
                looking at the priorities of the Executive and the money that
                needs to be made available to keep essential rural businesses in
                operation. It is my understanding that there have been some
                moves in that direction in Wales and Scotland — even in
                advance of movement from the UK Chancellor. If it is good enough
                for Wales and Scotland, it ought to be good enough for us as
                well. It is not acceptable that we sit and do nothing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, on the issue of welfare movements,
                the Minister has told us of the need for stringency. I fully
                accept that. However, we seem to be stuck in a dichotomy. A few
                months ago we were not stringent enough on those who traded in
                cattle and sheep, on those who brought sheep from across the
                water and moved them around, through mart after mart, within a
                few days. Now we are being excessively stringent on ordinary
                farmers who do not own every inch of the road along which they
                wish to move cattle. I ask the Minister to look at whether we
                are not being too stringent.</p>

                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Douglas:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This has been the most disastrous period for
                agriculture and the wider rural community in my memory. It even
                surpasses the BSE problem. It has been made worse by the fact
                that the farmers were beginning to see a light at the end of the
                BSE tunnel. When a scourge like this hits the agriculture
                industry it does not hit farmers only; it also causes suffering
                for all the reliant industries that supply the farming
                community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As has been stated, one of the casualties of
                the crisis which has seen its income wiped out overnight is the
                livestock option business and its employees. To date, there is
                no means by which to provide compensation for this sector, but
                financial help is needed urgently. The livestock market is
                important to Northern Ireland. When we have no livestock market
                it gives cash-hungry meat plants the opportunity to increase
                their prices. They enjoy a harvest and increase their profits.
                This will continue until the markets are re-opened. I urge the
                Minister to do something immediately, and in any way possible,
                for these businesses in the livestock industry that are most
                important to farming.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many farmers and their wives have diversified
                into bed-and-breakfast accommodation and other businesses, as
                they were encouraged to do. Now they find that their income is
                nil. People in bed-and-breakfast businesses are suffering the
                most, as people have been discouraged from visiting rural areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is also a need for farmers to be able
                to move stock in a sensible and progressive way. Our first
                priority is to beat the disease, but we must also allow movement
                to ensure that we do not cause greater hardship than we
                alleviate. By allowing monitored movement we can keep as much
                control as possible over the potential spread of this disease.
                When controls are tightened to draconian levels, as they are at
                present, we see more illegal movements, with the consequential
                loss of traceability.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many Members have highlighted the general
                problems faced, and I will not labour these points. However, the
                one area that needs to be explored more than any other is the
                movement of livestock — and even dead stock — into this
                country. The initial problem, as we all know, was caused by the
                improper control of imported sheep. This is something that must
                be properly controlled and monitored. We must ensure that any
                animals, especially those that are imported live, go only to the
                places allowed by their permits. Veterinary staff must ensure
                that this is what happens, so ensuring proper traceability.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Furthermore, we must have proper checks on
                animals coming into the country, so as to prevent, as far as
                humanly possible, health problems multiplying in our herds and
                flocks. Many animal health problems appear to have begun when
                proper border controls in Europe — and closer to home — were
                relaxed as part of closer European integration. The controls
                must be tightened once again in order to protect our industry.
                If we do not do it, no one else will.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must also ensure that imported food meets
                the standards that apply to our own producers. Food should not
                be imported from countries where foot-and-mouth disease is
                endemic in the animal population, when we are making such
                strenuous efforts to eradicate it from our own animals.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Illegal imports must be stopped immediately.
                Reports of rotting meat in suitcases and blood leaking from
                baggage at Heathrow airport show only some of the diseased meat
                and products coming into the country illegally. The Minister
                should tell Nick Brown in no uncertain terms that we must not be
                made the whipping boys of the world as far as imports are
                concerned.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department is to be commended on the work
                already undertaken, but the Minister should help prevent the
                spread of many farm diseases by considering simple measures,
                such as the reintroduction of grant-aiding and planting
                stock-proof hedging with appropriate fencing. I support the
                motion.</p>
                <b>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Much has been said about the immediate
                problems facing the farming industry as a result of
                foot-and-mouth disease. Everyone acknowledges that both the BSE
                crisis and foot-and-mouth disease were largely the product of
                central Government’s incompetence.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Paisley highlighted the preventative
                measures taken in the United States and other countries to
                prepare for a possible outbreak. Nothing of the kind took place
                in the United Kingdom. When the outbreak first occurred, it was
                suggested that the priority of the Government was their
                electoral position, rather than a speedy and effective programme
                for dealing with the disease.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to talk about the long-term effects of
                this particular crisis on the farming industry in Northern
                Ireland. There are those in the United Kingdom who look on this
                outbreak as a mixed blessing. They see it as accelerating the EU
                policy that the UK, including Northern Ireland, is not to be
                designated as a food-producing area for Europe.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The extension eastwards of the EU will
                include countries like Hungary and Poland, large proportions of
                whose gross domestic products (GDP) are devoted to agriculture.
                Why should we bother producing food in the United Kingdom when
                it can be produced much more cheaply in other areas that will
                come into the EU?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has been a policy to suggest that
                people should not be concerned about that, because farming
                products represent less than 1% of GDP. Foot-and-mouth disease
                has just accelerated a process that was already in the pipeline.
                Farmers in Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom will be
                converted into custodians of the countryside, while food is
                produced more cheaply in other parts of the EU.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now and in the recent past, the farming
                industry has benefited from subsidies and from some aspects of
                the common agricultural policy. People have been obsessed, to a
                degree, with exports. As agriculture forms a very large part of
                Northern Ireland’s GDP, that was understandable, but is it not
                a short-term attitude to take when the strategic aim of the EU
                is not to include the UK as one of its major food-producing
                areas?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are already political and other
                commentators writing in United Kingdom newspapers and asking why
                we should be excited about farming. What is the difference
                between the farmers and the miners? The miners, like the farmers
                at that time, were responsible for producing a relatively minor
                proportion of the GDP. We could buy coal more cheaply from
                Poland, the USA, South Africa and other places. They question
                why it should be any different for farming, given that food can
                be bought more cheaply from other places. Why should the farmers
                not fall into line with the programme designed for the United
                Kingdom within the EU? Under this programme, the UK is seen as a
                centre for tourism, entertainment and service industries but not
                for farming. That is why the farmer, in the future, is to be the
                custodian of the countryside.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The farming industry should look very
                carefully at the behaviour of central Government. The central
                Government do not care very much about how farming in Northern
                Ireland is affected because, although farming in Northern
                Ireland accounts for 6% of the GDP, it creates less than 1% in
                the UK. Although we are most acutely affected by the
                incompetence of central Government, the issue is not one that
                wrings the withers of many people on the mainland. It is
                important that our Department of Agriculture and Rural
                Development has a clear and unique programme for defending
                farming in Northern Ireland, because our industry is distinctly
                different from farming in any other part of the UK. Farming in
                Northern Ireland requires very special and effective treatment,
                if it is to be protected.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rural Ulster is at the point of despair.
                Ulster farming is going through another crisis on top of BSE,
                the Agivey fire that decimated the pig industry and the various
                regulations imposed by the European Union. Only Northern Ireland
                and the rest of the UK rigorously and vigorously apply those
                regulations to farming, while the rest of Europe just seems to
                toddle along. They make the regulations, but, of course, they
                also break them. Northern Ireland sticks to those regulations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a wide range of farming problems
                with major financial implications for the farming community.
                Workable solutions need to be found, and each solution has a
                financial implication. However, the finances available to the
                Chancellor of the Exchequer are very healthy, and a wise use of
                the multi-billion pound surplus that was announced recently by
                the Treasury will help the UK to recover from this calamity. Of
                course, that will happen only if the Treasury has the will to do
                it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The short-term future of the industry depends
                on the eradication of foot-and-mouth disease. However, the
                medium-and long-term future of the industry will be assured only
                by the provision of a massive financial investment package for
                the defence of the industry. Consumers need to support local
                produce, and the proper labelling of Northern Ireland produce
                will help that. A fair price for the farmers’ products would
                help, since there seems to be a large discrepancy between the
                amount paid to the farmer after his hard labour and the price
                paid by the housewife when she goes to the supermarket.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This morning, Dr Paisley mentioned the
                difficulties faced by the livestock markets. The Government
                ordered the closure of those markets, and staff had to be laid
                off. I have been sent copies of some of the rates bills that are
                still arriving on the premises, despite the fact that the doors
                of the businesses from which rates payment is being sought have
                been shut in accordance with the Government’s order. What
                steps is the Minister of Finance and Personnel going to take to
                guide these businessmen, and what relief are they really going
                to get?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This morning I listened to the Minster’s
                winding-up speech in which he told us about the problems with
                passing primary and secondary legislation. He said that there is
                no statutory basis for introducing the type of rates relief
                scheme that is being asked for and that there are difficulties
                with accelerated passage. I say to the Minister that where there
                is a will, there is a way. The sooner the Minister starts the
                programme, the sooner that help will become a reality to those
                who need it. Has the Minister of Finance and Personnel responded
                to the concerns that have been expressed about rates rises, some
                of which he and his Colleagues unfairly hiked?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Because they were ordered to close, will the
                rate demands for the premises be deferred until it is known for
                how long the premises will remain closed? The owners are paying
                rates, and they are getting demands for insurance. The Minister
                of Agriculture is holding up her hands to show that she does not
                know, and I accept that. However, the Minister can pass this
                question on to the Minister of Finance and Personnel.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Veterinary costs for animal movement licences
                should be the responsibility of the Department of Agriculture
                and Rural Development. There is no use in saying that it is
                everyone’s responsibility to beat the crisis when the
                debt-ridden farmers have no room to manoeuvre. I have
                consistently asked why there seems to be a different
                disinfecting policy at the border with the Irish Republic. Those
                travelling south are vigorously searched and go through a
                rigorous disinfectant process, but those coming from the South
                drive on into Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Farmers who have had their stock wiped out by
                BSE and the cull are left with a considerable amount of costly
                meal worth several thousand pounds, but no account has been
                taken of that for compensation purposes. Those same farmers must
                lay off their workers. They are faced with the obligation to
                make redundancy payments, but they are told that they will not
                receive any compensation for this.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other problems are also being faced. Pigs are
                overweight, because they have been kept on the farms.
                Nevertheless, when farmers take the pigs to the factory they
                will not get payment for the extra weight after the pigs come up
                to the specific demand weight, and, therefore, the farmers need
                compensation. The same applies to the animals that have been
                kept on farms for over 30 months and must be culled. There is a
                £200 differential. I would have expected a longer debate to get
                some answers to the problems that are faced by my constituents.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Armstrong:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issue is of grave concern to many people.
                It is important to inform people of how the disease came to the
                Province. The sheep were imported to be slaughtered but were
                not. Questions must be asked about how the sheep found their way
                to unsuspecting farms. If the handling of the sheep had been
                properly carried out and the papers that accompanied the animals
                checked off at their proper destination, I believe that the
                sheep would have been slaughtered at an abattoir, and Northern
                Ireland would not be in the situation that it is in today. We
                cannot relax our health standards — prevention is better than
                cure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There have been four cases of the disease in
                the Province to date. What way has the episode impacted on
                Northern Ireland? If we are to legislate properly to control the
                disease, we must first make an accurate assessment of its
                effects. I have first-hand experience of them; two of the cases
                occurred in the Coagh area of my constituency of Mid Ulster.
                They are within several miles of my own farm, and it is still in
                a 10km zone.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Farmers in that area are in a state of shock
                over their loss of livelihood. Does anyone care? The days are
                long; farmers have no stock to feed or tend and no financial
                income. UK farmers are also in a state of bewilderment. Farmers
                now represent the largest occupational suicide group in Britain.
                Farmers do not benefit from a 35-hour week, nor do they have a
                minimum wage. Industry has long been deprived of protective
                legislation but not of red tape and bureaucracy. Farmers have
                been exploited at the gain of the supermarkets. Everybody likes
                exotic fruit from faraway places, but is health not more
                important? There is an old saying, &quot;If you have your
                health, you are a millionaire&quot;. It is time we got our
                priorities right.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The personnel involved with farms and
                farm-associated enterprises are nervous wrecks; social events
                have been cancelled; fewer meals are being eaten in hotels;
                forest parks are closed; province-wide sporting fixtures have
                been cancelled; and the burning of cattle has done nothing to
                attract visitors. As Assembly Members we have a duty to give
                leadership during the crisis. We must provide whatever help we
                can to those worst affected by the situation. Compensation has
                been rightly awarded to those farmers who have seen their
                livelihood destroyed by the disease. What about the forgotten
                victims? What about the farmer who has sold all of his cattle to
                the abattoirs and the meat plants? He then finds that he cannot
                restock, because there are no livestock markets. Farmers need
                auction markets, and such markets are more hygienic than a lot
                of the places where farm sales are taking place.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What is to happen to my neighbouring farmer
                who has had all his animals culled and is left with a meal bill
                of over £5,000? Meal bills must be paid. Who will pay them?
                Will this farmer get compensation? I do not think so. According
                to the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development
                officials, no scheme exists to compensate farmers indirectly hit
                by foot-and-mouth disease. I call on central Government to
                provide a package to assist those people who have lost earnings
                from all types of farm business because of foot-and-mouth
                disease.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thankfully, to date, the disease has been
                rapidly contained. The use of disinfectant mats, the spraying of
                vehicles and general caution have helped to do that. We need
                practical solutions to deal with the crisis. I want to see a
                change in the present policy concerning the movement of animals.
                I recognise the need for caution, but I also see the importance
                of getting animals out to pasture as soon as possible. I would
                support disease-free animals being moved to disease-free areas
                thirty days after the last outbreak.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The EU has closed all auction markets. That
                is a big problem. We need auction markets, and they should be
                reopened. There is only one way to achieve that, and that is for
                us to have a disease-free area. When that happens, auction
                markets will again open.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Serious animal welfare problems can be seen
                already, so we need to introduce an animal welfare movement
                scheme to alleviate this problem. Farmers are the stewards of
                the land, and Northern Ireland farmers are among the best in the
                world. The sooner the agriculture industry is revived, the
                better it will be for all dependent industries. I look forward
                to the day that the industry thrives again and the Province as a
                whole is better off.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dallat:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree that the Executive have an important
                role to play in addressing the problems of farming and rural
                communities, as they have in all aspects of life. I am pleased
                that this fact is acknowledged in the motion from the
                Chairperson of the Agriculture Committee, Rev Ian Paisley. It
                would be nice if the two DUP Ministers would join their
                Colleagues on the Executive and help to deal with the problem.
                In time, perhaps they will.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The families directly affected by
                foot-and-mouth disease are a special case, and while they will
                receive compensation for their losses, it is freely accepted
                that the fall-out from such losses of stock, built up over many
                years, will have an impact for years to come. It has been
                suggested that some farmers may never recover, and had we still
                been living under direct rule, that would have been the case.
                However, with our Assembly we can do something, and the public
                expects us to.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Farmers need compensation for their loss of
                earnings. However, there must be a holistic approach to the
                economic needs of the rural community. There must be massive
                reinvestment, structured not simply to make up for the effects
                of foot-and-mouth disease but to regenerate the entire
                countryside.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is often said that when the farming
                community catches a cold, the rural community gets flu. How much
                worse it is then when there is an outbreak of foot-and-mouth
                disease. It is at times like this that we begin to realise just
                how dependent our economy is on the farming community. The
                ripple effect is quite startling.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Foot-and-mouth disease has had a profound
                effect on mainstream tourism, as Sir Reg Empey and others have
                pointed out. However, very little has been said about the
                downturn in rural tourism. Rural tourism is fundamental to the
                economic regeneration of many communities and plays an
                increasing part in rural diversification. With the fall-off in
                visitors from abroad and the closure of visitor centres, forest
                parks and angling and equestrian centres, rural tourism has come
                to a virtual standstill. Shops in small towns, already reeling
                from the uncontrolled development of out-of-town shopping
                centres cannot afford to go through the economic slump that has
                been caused as a result of the foot-and-mouth epidemic. They are
                facing serious cash-flow problems.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is only at a time like this that we
                realise just how many people are involved in a wide range of
                industries in rural communities dependent, to some degree, on
                farming. There are many cogs in the economic wheel, and they are
                all inter-dependent. Many of them have already been referred to,
                so I will not repeat what has been already said, but I support
                the pleas for help. Nothing good can come out of the
                foot-and-mouth outbreak other than perhaps a realisation that
                farming is much more important to the economic well-being of the
                community than has been previously thought.</p>
                <i>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have heard often today of the
                interdependence of different segments of our economy. That is
                welcome. Out of this crisis there may come some good. For too
                long, we have not fully appreciated just how much we depend on
                each other. I have no doubt that the Executive will address that
                problem and do everything possible to obtain additional
                resources from Britain and from Europe. As time passes, the
                economy will recover. The farming ship can be refloated,
                provided everyone is rising on the tide of recovery together.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Perhaps the Agriculture Committee has not
                spent enough time discussing rural development per se, and that
                has been a mistake. We can now move forward with greater
                maturity and a sense of just how important the whole rural
                community is. Let us never forget that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It would be remiss of me not to acknowledge
                the sterling work done by the Minister of Agriculture and her
                staff. Indeed, most people have behaved with honour and
                integrity during this crisis. I have to say with regret,
                however, that the scurrilous claim made by Rev Dr William McCrea
                — that animals affected by foot- and-mouth might be buried on
                the farm of the Donnelly family at Ardboe — was nothing short
                of an absolute scandal, for which he has still to apologise.
                Others also tried to make political capital out of this
                disaster, but surely that was the worst example. I hope that the
                Minister will have something to say about that. Let us hope that
                the Executive will support the Minister fully in the demands
                that she will be required to make for additional resources. I
                believe that they will do their best, and they have my support.
                I support the motion.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.
                I welcome the opportunity to discuss this matter. The social
                effects of foot-and-mouth disease on the farming community can
                be compared to those of the industrial revolution on England and
                other parts, because people who were farming prior to the
                foot-and-mouth outbreak will not be farming again. The social
                effect that that will have on those communities cannot be
                quantified at this time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Bob McCartney said, the bureaucrats in
                Brussels and elsewhere will be quite comfortable with the plight
                that the farming community finds itself in. They could not have
                legislated for the farming community in the way that this
                disease has. To them, foot-and-mouth disease, in decimating the
                farming community, particularly in this part of Ireland, takes a
                thorn out of their side. Those farmers who want to come back to
                farming will be coming back on Brussels’ terms, and not on the
                criteria of local needs and local economic circumstances.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many will be quite comfortable with the
                tragedy facing the farming community. I regret that we do not
                have the time that we should to debate this critical and tragic
                circumstance. We do not have much time to address all the issues
                that have been raised with us at local level. We do not have the
                opportunity to expand on the full effects that this is going to
                have on the lives of people in the farming community. I will
                touch on just a few elements.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The value of animals and the compensation
                being paid to farmers look good. People are talking about
                someone’s getting £1 million. However, let us look at the
                replacement value of sheep and cattle. They are going to become
                a very scarce commodity in big demand. We all know the economic
                consequences of a scarce commodity and a high demand: the price
                of livestock will be driven up. Those who are paid £90 to £135
                compensation for ewes today will not be able to replace them at
                that price. The same applies to cattle.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What about those farmers who have lost their
                dairy herds and do not have their creamery cheque coming in
                every week? If they want to re-engage in dairy farming, they
                will have to wait a long time for another creamery cheque.
                Indeed, they will have to wait a long time to be able to replace
                the herds that they have lost due to the foot-and-mouth plague.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is also the question raised by some in
                the farming community of the delay in payments. In addition,
                there is the question of the Department of Health, Social
                Services and Public Safety requiring some farmers to produce
                evidence of their earnings over the last 15 months. This
                compares unfavourably with the package for farmers in the rest
                of Ireland who lost their animals because of foot-and-mouth
                disease.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are also concerns about the slaughter
                of healthy animals. However, we cannot discuss all these issues
                in the short time that is available to us. People in Moyle —
                an area that has the highest unemployment rate in the North of
                Ireland — have no means of earning a livelihood other than
                farming. They have earned their livelihood through farming for
                generations and are now unemployed with nowhere else to go for
                employment. They are suffering grievously. Compassion and
                charity ought to be extended to those in the farming community
                who are suffering rather than the concept of a witch-hunt.</p>

                foot-and-mouth outbreak first commenced in this country — the
                area of Meigh. There are many deep concerns in the south Armagh
                area, especially about the illegal movement of sheep and the
                money that has been wasted in past years because of that illegal
                movement. I want to know from the Minister what the Department
                and the Executive intend to do about the subsidy collectors. I
                do not call these people who have been wasting public money for
                years &quot;farmers&quot;; I call them &quot;subsidy
                collectors&quot;. They have being acting illegally in south
                Armagh and across the country for years. What does the
                Department intend to do about these people?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What measures does the Department of
                Agriculture and Rural Development have in place to deal with the
                issue of smuggling? This is an issue that the Public Accounts
                Committee is going to have to zoom in on closely, because money
                is being wasted. All the farmers in south Armagh are not
                carrying out this activity. I stress that. There are many decent
                farmers in south Armagh, from both sides of the community, who
                have been affected. The ridiculous behaviour and illegal
                activities of some people have put the brakes on this Province
                — not only on the agriculture industry but also on tourism and
                businesses across the country.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are many questions that must be asked
                today. Indeed, they have already been asked by many Members.
                There were concerns in the Newry Divisional Veterinary Office in
                the middle of March that the numbers of sheep that were claimed
                for did not match the number of sheep that were being culled. I
                want the Minister to tell us exactly the number of sheep premium
                claims measured against the actual number of sheep culled. That
                is an issue that must be cleared up and that the Minister must
                address.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not saying that the Minister has been
                turning a blind eye to this, because she has been very critical
                of people who have been acting illegally in the south Armagh
                area. There have been concerns in that area since the cull
                commenced. A veterinary officer removed members of the grants
                and subsidy inspection unit in the Newry area from the cull
                site.</p>

                There is anxiety in south Armagh and across the country because
                foot-and-mouth disease has entered the Province. It is because
                of the Republician movement in south Armagh that there is this

                various organisations involved at the sharp end of this crisis

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is an historical context that others
                have mentioned. There were outbreaks in 1967 and 1865. I indulge
                the Minister and refer her to one of the minor prophets in the
                Old Testament, Joel, who had much that is strangely relevant to
                say on this issue. I invite the Minister to look at that. The
                Chairperson of the Agriculture and Rural Development Committee
                will no doubt be aware of it already.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to deal with the practical problems
                arising from this plague, its outbreak and spread, the
                containment measures that are being brought forward and the
                ongoing measures against it. The impact of this disease on the
                rural economy and the Northern Ireland economy in general has
                been profound, and in this morning’s debate we heard of many
                of the problems being experienced by those who are affected by
                the consequential losses. All farmers and associated businesses
                expect and need the assistance of the Ministers, Executive and
                Members of this Assembly to lessen the impact and to give
                valuable help.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Like other Members, I welcome the easing of
                the restrictions announced recently by the Minister in relation
                to the movement of livestock. I join in the call of other
                Members for the Minister to confirm that private veterinary fees
                will be met in full either by her Department, by the Ministry of
                Agriculture, Fisheries and Food or by the Treasury in London.
                Having spoken to many constituents and farmers affected by this
                plague, I know it is a very big issue, and I hope that the
                Minister will address it when she speaks later. I impress upon
                the Minister the need to ensure that urgently required measures
                of assistance are not impeded by red tape and that urgent
                consideration be given to the plight of those affected in all
                sectors.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I draw the Minister’s particular attention
                and concern to the plight of the livestock marts and to the
                precarious position of their owners, operators and employees. We
                will look to the Minister today for an announcement of
                assistance to that particular sector.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also impress upon the Minister the need for
                a multi- agency approach to this crisis. Helpline numbers and
                the various necessary contacts that will be available to deal
                with the social dimension of this particular crisis should be
                made known to the general public either by public advertisement
                or by media campaign. I hope that the Minister will be in a
                position to announce a major co-ordinated plan as part of the
                response to this crisis.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Time does not permit me to say much more
                except that everyone in Northern Ireland accepts the need for
                urgent help to be given to the agriculture industry.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGrady:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although some of us are city-based, all of us
                in this Assembly represent rural constituencies; indeed our
                whole ethos is based on the rural community. We know that the
                impact of foot-and-mouth disease will be felt not just this year
                but for many years to come in both the farming industry and its
                auxiliary industries.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have no doubt that given the opportunity
                and appropriate assistance, our farming community is resilient
                enough to overcome this fresh disaster and re-establish itself
                as a primary industry in Northern Ireland with its products
                hailed throughout the world for their health and quality.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion asks the Executive to alleviate
                the difficulties of the farming community quickly and
                imaginatively. Members must confine themselves to that. It is
                tempting to look forward to what may happen in the future, but
                we are talking about what can happen today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I represent a rural community, both highland
                and lowland, and on a day-to-day basis I see the trauma and
                difficulties faced by the farming community. It is up to the
                Assembly to give that community its total support. We must
                address two matters — regulation and finance. On the
                day-to-day basis of regulation, most farms — particularly the
                sheep farms on the highlands and the cattle housed over winter
                — have exhausted their winter fodder and the immediate grazing
                fodder that they were on before movements were restricted.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive must not slavishly follow
                everything that happens in Great Britain. As the motion says,
                the Executive must be imaginative in how they approach these
                issues. Farms in Northern Ireland are different from those in
                Great Britain. Our farms are small and contiguous, but in many
                cases their fields are scattered. You do not get that in large
                parts of England. Therefore, the issue of movement is vital.
                Farmers are now destroying the land that was intended to provide
                fodder for the ensuing winter by overgrazing it — if
                destroying is the right word. There is an immediate projection
                of difficulty there.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the few minutes allowed to me I can only
                highlight a couple of the things that we need to do. The
                intervention board — both here and in Great Britain — needs
                to extend its scope to compensate for the immediate welfare
                cull, and that should be done as soon as possible. Any
                assistance to the cash flow of farmers must be of immediate
                importance. Dr Paisley mentioned the rapid payment of premiums,
                and all other available and lawful subsidies should be paid on
                an urgent basis.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is also important that a livestock welfare
                disposal scheme — as exists in England, Scotland and Wales —
                be established here. The scheme in Great Britain applies only to
                restricted areas. All of Northern Ireland is a restricted area
                at present, so this scheme could apply to the whole of Northern
                Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many Members have mentioned the veterinary
                fees incurred in obtaining movement licences. There are many
                farms in my area that have bits and pieces of land and scattered
                fields. If those farmers were to fulfil their total movement
                they would be paying six, seven or eight times the fee of £30,
                depending on how many dispersed fields they have. It is
                important that something be done to alleviate that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The financial cost of the disaster is not the
                greatest issue; there is also an emotive issue. Farmers resent
                having to pay for the implementation of regulations that were
                imposed on them on top of the other difficulties. The use of
                serology testing, particularly in sheep, may enable movements to
                be expanded. The farming community will need some pump-priming
                in the immediate future to tide it over the summer and into the
                winter feed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I congratulate the Minister on her sterling
                work to date.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Wells:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The debate has covered almost every issue
                around foot-and-mouth disease. Rather than repeat many of the
                points, I will ask the Minister to address four areas of real
                concern to farmers, particularly in south Down.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is the Minister in a position to make any
                announcement about the payment of vet bills? I feel sorry for
                vets in rural areas. They are worked off their feet, but the
                last thing that farmers need is to find that they have to pay
                bills for inspections before animals can be moved. I understand
                that there is provision elsewhere for these to be paid by the
                Department. It would be a gesture of goodwill to the farming
                community if the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development
                were to pick up the bills, as it is no fault of the farmers that
                they are incurring these expenses.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, when will movements of sheep be
                permitted? In many parts of south Down the relaxation of the
                rules which were announced last week to enabled cattle to be
                moved is not producing any benefits for two reasons. First, in
                many cases a farmer only has sheep. Secondly, it is proving
                almost impossible for farmers to find land that does not have
                sheep grazing on it or has not been grazed by sheep in the past
                14&nbsp;days. This morning I received a telephone call from a
                very concerned farmer saying that he has searched everywhere but
                cannot find any land which has not had sheep grazing on it
                recently or does not have sheep just across the ditch. When will
                that ban be relaxed?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like the Minister to address
                something that was suggested to me by the Rathfriland Farmers
                Co-Operative Society Limited. At present farmers are being
                forced to take small numbers of lambs to meat plants in
                Londonderry and Coleraine. One farmer had to drive to Coleraine
                with only eight lambs in his trailer. That almost wipes out any
                possible profit on the transaction, given the very low prices
                that farmers are getting for lambs. The Rathfriland Co-Op
                suggested — and this is a very good idea — that marts should
                be used as central points to which farmers could bring their
                lambs. A large trailer containing up to 300&nbsp;lambs could
                then be taken to Londonderry for the lambs to be processed. That
                would be a way of getting the marts back into some form of
                activity. It would also be a way of alleviating the problem of
                the meat plant in Lurgan that is taking very small numbers of
                lambs. Farmers from Rathfriland and Kilkeel are driving over
                100&nbsp;miles to sell small numbers of livestock, which is
                totally uneconomical.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally — and this is directly related to
                foot-and-mouth disease, Madam Deputy Speaker — what has
                happened to the proposal for compensation for the sheep grazing
                ban in the inner Mournes? It has reached a complete stop because
                of foot-and-mouth disease. I fully understand that the
                Department of Agriculture and Rural Development has been
                preoccupied with this vital issue, but farmers in the Mournes
                have subsidy application forms which must be filled in by the
                middle of this month. However, no decision has been made on
                discussions between the Minister of Agriculture and Rural
                Development and the Minister for Regional Development on what
                will be done to compensate those farmers or at least enable them
                to put the lambs that they regularly graze in the inner Mournes
                onto their farms. If the Minister comes to some conclusion that
                will enable hard-pressed farmers to include that land on their
                claim forms, she will help them greatly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">South Down is one of the most badly affected
                areas because of the nature of farming. Some farmers are one
                step away from bankruptcy. I have heard some of the most
                appalling stories from farmers over the last few weeks. I have
                had to put some of them in touch with charitable foundations in
                England, and they have had to ring up and plead for money to pay
                the most basic of household bills such as the telephone bill or
                the heating oil bill.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unless we do something positive to help
                farmers out of this difficult situation, which is absolutely no
                fault of their own, I will be really fearful about the future of
                many of those small units which were practically on their knees
                before this crisis ever arose. They are facing a dreadful
                prospect. If a survey were carried out in Northern Ireland, the
                results would be the same as those in England. Many farmers see
                this as the straw that will break the camel’s back. The
                situation is desperate, and they are looking to the Department
                of Agriculture and Rural Development to do something to
                alleviate it.</p>

                motion today and to all the Members who spoke to it and
                demonstrated their commitment to the rural community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since taking up my post as Agriculture
                Minister I have been deeply impressed by the resilience of our
                farmers who seem to have suffered one body blow after another
                over the last few years. It has been my privilege to meet with
                many groups of farmers in many different circumstances, and I
                have never failed to be impressed by their fortitude and
                courtesy.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today’s motion recognises</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;…the sacrifices made by, and hardship
                caused to, farmers [and] their families.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nobody, inside or outside Northern Ireland,
                or in this Chamber today would disagree with that description of
                what the Northern Ireland farmers have had to contend with.
                Foot-and-mouth disease is merely the latest in a long line of
                what I have called &quot;body blows&quot;. An outbreak of
                foot-and-mouth disease is a terrible thing at the best of times,
                but this time it has come on top of BSE, a very strong pound —
                with all that that entails in relation to foreign competition
                — and a succession of animal health problems and food scares.
                The foot-and-mouth disease situation is therefore all the more
                difficult to deal with.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the motion recognises, the problems go
                beyond the farmer or the farmgate. I am acutely conscious of the
                impact of recent events, not just on the farmers but on the
                wider community. That problem is the responsibility of other
                Ministers and the Executive collectively, and it was addressed
                in this morning’s debate. For that reason I must confine my
                remarks to the impact of foot-and- mouth disease on the
                agriculture industry alone.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important to remember that today we are
                discussing the impact of foot-and-mouth disease, rather than the
                cumulative financial effects of all the crises I mentioned. The
                farm incomes of most Northern Ireland farmers are currently very
                depressed, but that is mainly the result of factors other than
                foot-and-mouth disease.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are two classes of loss arising from
                foot- and-mouth disease. One relates to livestock which my
                Department has caused to be slaughtered as a disease- control
                measure. The position on that is clear — the Department pays
                the full market value of such animals. The problem arises with
                the second category — consequential loss. This can include
                anything from, at one end of the spectrum, the loss of a farmer’s
                income while the farm is depopulated to, at the other end, the
                loss of schoolchildren’s deposits paid for school trips to the
                country which have had to be cancelled. Specific issues affect
                the livestock marts which have now been closed for many weeks,
                first at the behest of the Government and, subsequently, at that
                of the European Union. The situation of these marts represents a
                particular problem.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I have said on numerous occasions in this
                Assembly, the financial repercussions of meeting the costs of
                consequential losses would be enormous. Even if the Government
                make just a slight move in that direction, we will come under
                immense pressure to go the whole way. For that reason it is not
                current UK Government policy to pay compensation for
                consequential losses. If that changes, however, Members can rest
                assured that I will press for the necessary additional funding
                to be made available to Northern Ireland to allow us to make
                similar payments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The other constraint on me, as Minister of
                Agriculture, is the need to comply with EU law on the provision
                of cash aid to farmers. I have to obtain EU state aids approval
                before I grant any cash aid to Northern Ireland farmers.
                Obtaining that approval takes time, and all the evidence
                suggests that Brussels requires considerable convincing that
                such aid is justified and that it does not distort the market.
                As Agriculture Minister, I find that my freedom to act quickly
                and imaginatively is therefore perhaps more narrow than some
                Members might imagine.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Time does not permit me to reply to all the
                detailed points made in the debate, and I apologise in advance.
                I will, however, try to cover as many as possible. Dr Paisley
                made many points about the impact of the outbreak of
                foot-and-mouth disease, and with hindsight I agree with many of
                them. He referred to the livestock marts, and, as I have already
                said, I have particular sympathy for their owners. I will do
                what I can to help them. I understand that the Minister of
                Finance and Personnel referred to this matter in this morning’s
                debate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As far as movement controls are concerned, I
                cannot promise an early further easing of controls, since my
                priority is the prevention of disease. The earlier easements of
                movement restrictions were abused, and the foot- and-mouth virus
                has now spread to the sheep flock. My primary objective is to
                eradicate the disease. Farmers must decide which option is
                preferable — total easement of movement with the risk of
                spreading the disease, or to wait until we are sure we are on
                top of it. I would, however, urge people with particular and
                extreme welfare problems to contact their local divisional
                veterinary office.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to payments, I can tell the
                Assembly that the Department’s published payment targets are
                being met, but we are trying to speed up payments. As for the
                Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS) payments, we
                are pursuing with the Commission an extension of the period
                during which farmers can make amendments to their IACS
                applications — including land changes — without penalties.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I intend to raise the issue of
                regionalisation with the European Commission at the earliest
                opportunity. We have to realise that we have no chance of
                regionalisation before the blood testing has been completed,
                given the distribution of the foot-and-mouth disease outbreaks.
                I will progress the matter when the time and conditions are
                right. I referred to August as a possible date for resumption in
                response to a question in the Committee. I was simply saying
                that it could be as late as August — I was not saying that it
                would be August. If possible, resumption will take place
                earlier. We have to go through a series of blood testing and so
                on, which is not an overnight matter. It will take weeks, and we
                have to be free for 30 days from any other outbreak of foot-and
                mouth disease.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As to the issue of the burning of carcasses
                versus burial, I am guided by the advice of my Chief Veterinary
                Officer and also have to take account of environmental concerns
                which sometimes prevent the burial of carcasses.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Paisley and other Members also referred to
                the costs of issuing movement permits by private veterinary
                practitioners. I have taken note of these comments and will be
                reconsidering the position in relation to those fees.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The foot-and-mouth disease outbreak in
                Northern Ireland has already taught us a great deal. Those of us
                who had any doubt have now seen the value of a devolved
                Administration. The situation has taught us that our controls on
                livestock movements were not as tight as we had imagined. Above
                all, we have learned that unscrupulous people are prepared to
                sacrifice the livelihood of farmers, both north and south of the
                border, on the altar of a quick and dirty profit for themselves.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McHugh and others referred to the alleged
                failure by the Department to deal with illegal activities. The
                Department has not been remiss in any way in following up these
                matters. All reports of illegal activity are being investigated
                with the utmost rigour. I can assure the Assembly that any of
                our officials who see any suspicion of illegal activity at the
                ports act on it and have in the past acted on it. This is one
                issue which was publicly aired in an erroneous manner this
                morning. We have had success in dealing with this matter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dallat referred to the carcasses which
                were buried on Mr Donnelly’s farm at Ardboe and the
                allegations made by Rev William McCrea. I deeply regret the
                additional distress caused to the Donnelly family by those
                public comments. I can now confirm that, following exhumation of
                those carcasses, I am totally satisfied that this was a routine
                case of disposal of fallen animals, and I wish the matter to be
                publicly known. This happens in the normal course of events on
                every farm. Tests were carried out at Pirbright on samples from
                those animals, and they have proved negative for foot-and-mouth
                disease.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I take the point made by Mr Robert McCartney
                about the review of the common agricultural policy. I regret the
                fact that Mr McCartney, having made his contribution, left the
                Chamber without listening to the rest of the debate or awaiting
                my reply to his comments, which were directed at the UK
                Government more than to the Northern Ireland Administration.
                Perhaps he forgot which House he was in.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a danger of the agriculture industry
                in Northern Ireland’s being overlooked. Mr&nbsp;McCartney will
                recognise the important role to be played by our devolved
                Administration and by the North/South Ministerial Council in the
                development of a common approach. This will take account of the
                priorities shared by all of us on this island with regard to the
                agriculture industry, which is of such importance to us.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Berry made remarks about the south Armagh
                cull. I deeply resent the implication that our veterinary
                division in Newry is turning a blind eye to fraud. On behalf of
                those people I want to make that clear.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is a serious allegation, and I resent the
                implication. Mr Berry may well be misinformed about some of the
                issues he raised. Mr Wells made a few points, and I have already
                dealt with the issue of the private veterinary practitioners. He
                also raised the issue of marts as gathering points. I am aware
                that the Republic is looking at this issue, but I am not sure if
                it has taken action on it yet. I will look at every possibility.
                I see that Mr Wells is not here either.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr McClelland] in the

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will look at all possibilities for easing
                the plight of the farming community. However, I have to take
                into consideration my priority, which is to ensure that the
                disease does not spread, and I will take veterinary advice on
                that. I have heard what Mr Wells said and I will take note of
                it, bearing in mind that I also have to take veterinary advice
                on the risk of spreading the disease.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Undoubtedly other lessons will emerge before
                we are finished. However, I will do what I can to deal with
                those issues in the weeks to come. I intend to introduce
                measures, based on what has happened, to prevent further
                outbreaks of the disease in Northern Ireland. I intend to
                introduce legislation to ban the feeding of swill to pigs, given
                that this was at the root of the present crisis.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will also impose a movement standstill on
                livestock to prevent animals being traded and moved within 30
                days of their last move. It is clear that the movement of sheep
                from one place to another within a few days has had a serious
                impact on the present situation. It has made it difficult to
                find the source of outbreaks and to predict where future
                outbreaks might occur.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is clear that the lack of proper
                identification of sheep was a major contribution to the
                irregular trading that led to the foot-and-mouth outbreaks here.
                Accordingly, I will be setting up a regime requiring the
                individual identification of sheep and pigs. This will have
                major implications for the industry and my Department. The
                financial implications will need to be addressed, but I am
                determined to proceed with this.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will also seek to amend the current
                penalties in our animal health legislation to provide meaningful
                deterrents against illegal activities. I will, where necessary,
                bring our legislation into line with the changes recently
                announced in the Republic of Ireland. Finally, I will be
                strengthening my Department’s anti-fraud efforts.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">None of these measures will help farmers in
                the immediate financial sense. There may even be some short-term
                inconvenience for them. However, in the long term, these
                measures will help to ensure that our chances of importing a
                disease like foot-and-mouth-disease will be very much reduced in
                the future. That can only be in the best financial interest of
                the farming industry in the long term.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I appreciate what has been a constructive
                debate. I appreciate the clear concern for the farming industry
                that exists throughout the Assembly and the community at this
                time. I would like to put on record my appreciation of the
                manner in which Members from different parties have acted in the
                best interests of the industry. They have, on the whole, refused
                to get into party political points scoring. I say &quot;on the
                whole&quot; because there is an exception to every rule.
                However, I deeply appreciate the cross-party support that I have
                been given.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The farming community also appreciates it.
                Our common interests have been much more important than the
                things that divide us and will continue to divide us because we
                come from different experiences, points of view, aspirations and
                allegiances. This is a hugely important issue for Northern
                Ireland, regardless of the political divide.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The manner in which the Members of the
                Assembly have been able to work constructively together, often
                despite deep political differences, is an example of the
                importance of the work that we are doing. I hope that it will
                strengthen our resolve to continue to work for the benefit of
                the people in Northern Ireland.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy Chairperson of the Agriculture and
                Rural Development Committee (Mr Savage):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fact that we are debating a major
                agriculture motion for the second time in one day is evidence of
                the seriousness with which the Assembly has taken the plight of
                agriculture. It is important to put on the record that the
                Assembly identifies, and is seen to be identifying, with the
                suffering of the farming community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly must record its thanks to the
                farming community for the massive efforts that it has made to
                support the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development and
                the Assembly in the measures that have been taken to stem the
                advance of foot-and-mouth disease. Its adherence to fortress
                farming has been difficult, but it has shown, once again, a
                great sense of public responsibility by acting with fortitude
                and courage after so many reverses in the past decade.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Regardless of political standpoint, the few
                selfish farmers who moved animals illegally for personal gain
                are traitors to all communities on this island. Those farmers
                are far from typical and stand out because farmers, as a whole,
                have been exemplary citizens who have acted courageously and
                responsibly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the hundreds of people who have
                contacted the Department and my office. I am glad that we have
                been able to serve them in many different ways and resolve the
                difficulties for many.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I place on record my thanks to the staff of
                the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development and, in
                particular, to the staff of the Minister’s private office who
                have worked tirelessly and in close co-operation with us. They
                are always ready to answer the many queries that we pass on to
                them daily and to seek practical solutions to many difficult
                problems.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I acknowledge the workers who have manned the
                disinfectant sprayers day and night. They are the unsung heroes
                of this crisis. I also thank the Minister for coming, week by
                week, to the Agriculture and Rural Development Committee to
                report to us on the latest developments. She has personally kept
                in close contact with us throughout this crisis.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To ease restrictions on farmers, the Minister
                has spoken of the constant reviewing of matters while not
                risking further outbreaks of the disease. The Assembly expects
                nothing less of the Minister and the Department. Assuming that
                she has a range of available measures, the Minister should
                publish a possible timetable for the easing of the restrictions
                provided there are no further outbreaks. Such a timetable would
                give hope, offer farmers the prospect of light at the end of
                this dark tunnel and encourage them to maintain the practices
                that should, in turn, enable her to ease the restrictions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Livestock marts have experienced difficulty
                through being closed for over nine weeks with no income. The
                Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development forecast yesterday
                that the reopening of marts will take place a long way down the
                line. She also said that the marts were now being closed down in
                accordance with an EU Directive. I trust that, given the
                importance of marts to rural Northern Ireland, she will not sit
                back and allow Brussels to dictate to us on that issue, but that
                they will work tirelessly to secure their reopening at the
                earliest appropriate stage.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is one example of a time when
                imaginative solutions must be found. The Minister must come up
                with ideas, and if the Minister will say that the Committee
                would welcome ideas, I have no doubt that Members will make many
                suggestions. We would be willing to make suggestions, as we have
                done many times in the past, and I am sure that the Minister
                could respond to them. I am pleased that the Minister is willing
                to listen, but she must not hide behind words. It is up to her
                Department to come up with the solutions, and that is why she
                has a large organisation behind her and the Executive authority
                to implement decisions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This morning I said that the crisis demands
                an imaginative solution, and I make no apology for reiterating
                what needs to be said. Papering over the cracks will not do —
                something far more radical is called for. That is why I agree
                with my fellow Members that a compensation package that is not
                just adequate but generous must be worked out. The package must
                take account of the capital value of the farmers’ losses,
                their loss of income and the consequential loss of income by
                others in the wider rural community. The compensation package
                must also cover related industries such as tourism.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, I would like to go much further. As
                recently as last week, a ‘Farmers Weekly’ survey indicated
                that a third of farmers affected by foot-and-mouth disease want
                to leave farming. As the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and
                Food, Mr Nick Brown, said in ‘The Daily Telegraph’ on
                Saturday</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Frankly, I am not surprised. For many
                farmers the foot-and-mouth disease has been the last blow. It is
                a natural point to think about an alternative future.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister went on to reveal that he</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;is also considering introducing an
                early retirement package for farmers hit by the foot-and-mouth
                crisis.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That measure runs along similar lines to
                those proposed by my own party, and I think that this is an
                ideal time to bring it into place.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am a member of the Committee of the
                Regions, and at a meeting that I attended recently in Europe,
                many countries signalled their intention to introduce a similar
                scheme. Many expressed a direct interest in the issue, because
                Europe experiences the very same problems as we do. The scheme
                would allow older farmers to retire with dignity, a lump sum and
                a pension, while enabling young blood, with new ideas, to enter
                farming. This is the scale of the response that is needed to
                tackle this latest farming crisis. That alone would allow the
                farmers to receive what they are owed — an organised
                restructuring of farming with the support of the Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must not allow farming to descend into a
                free trade free-for-all, because that would result in decent men
                and women being thrown on to the scrap heap. We want to
                restructure farming in a constructive and forthright manner. We
                want the farmers to keep the money that is tied up in the farms,
                and we want to make sure that the banks do not take the best
                part of that money. We owe the farmers more than that, and every
                right-thinking person would agree. We must forge partnerships
                with all the relevant Departments and signal strong Government
                interest in an early retirement scheme. The time for action is
                now. Many imaginative ideas about the future of farming have
                been given to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF).
                It was mentioned earlier that farmers are to become the
                custodians of the countryside — countryside managers who would
                be paid for the first time to enforce Europe standards on
                landscape, environmental schemes, stockbreeding and countryside
                management.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the moment 80% of the countryside is
                managed by 4% of farmers. As we heard from the Department of
                Agriculture, farmers will also be encouraged to go into organic
                farming. In the future, farming here must be more and more about
                quality and the pursuit of high-value niche markets in
                sophisticated, rich marketplaces to meet the low cost and low
                overhead threat from the East European countries that will soon
                join the European Union.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must move forward. It is plain that
                Northern Ireland needs a new 10-year national strategy for
                agriculture so that farmers have, for the first time, a real
                sense of where they are going. We also need to know where the
                Government are going. If these elements are put in place,
                agriculture will rise once again.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister referred to the introduction of
                new rules on standstill of animals and the individual
                identification of livestock. I hope that livestock marts will be
                able to play a part in that. Another thing that I picked up from
                the Minister’s statement was the anti-fraud issue. I do not
                think that there is a Member here who would disagree with the
                measures that the Minister is attempting to take. I thank the
                Minister for her contribution. Almost 20 Members took part in
                the debate today, and I thank them also. It has been the sincere
                desire of every Member here to try to alleviate the problems
                facing the agriculture industry in Northern Ireland and to get
                it back onto a sure and firm footing.</p>

                wide range of bodies including the Department, the public
                sector, trade unions, business associations, district councils,
                education and community groups. Three of the oral evidence
                sessions were held outside Parliament Buildings at Queen’s
                University, Moyle District Council and Strabane District
                Council. The Committee was almost overwhelmed by the volume and
                the quality of the evidence received.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We wish to place on record our extreme
                gratitude to all of those who submitted oral and written
                evidence. The evidence helped inform, to a large extent, the
                many important recommendations we make in our report.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the major criticisms of ‘Strategy
                2010’ related to the consultation process. There was a
                distinct lack of a structured process in which constructive
                comments could have been made and taken account of. The lack of
                consultation led to confusion about the status of the ‘Strategy
                2010’ report. People did not know whether it was an
                implementation document or a first draft to be modified in the
                light of debate. The Committee feels that the ‘Strategy 2010’
                report should have been prepared in a context in which it was
                clearly intended for open discussion by groups representing all
                areas of society.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In any major strategic initiative the policy
                maker should only proceed to implementation stage after the most
                exhaustive consultation has taken place. The Committee believes
                it has now rectified the flaws in the consultation process,
                given the many public evidence sessions we held.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There were other criticisms of the report.
                These included the fact that there were too many unconstructed
                and unprioritised recommendations — 62 in all. It was also
                said that there was a lack of any attempt to link the
                recommendations to the targets and that there were targets
                missing in the report — for example, on productivity growth,
                public sector research and development and tourism. There were
                criticisms of a lack of any economic modelling which would have
                enabled baseline forecasts to be prepared and of a lack of any
                analysis of past, or current, economic development policies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee debated whether ‘Strategy
                2010’ should be completely revised and redrafted.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, we recognised the urgency of the
                economic challenges and considered that any further delay was
                not an option. The most appropriate policies should be adopted
                now and should be widely understood.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee made 39 recommendations. These
                were made in the context of globalisation. Perhaps at this point
                I should say a word about globalisation. The Committee
                recognised that any economic development strategy needs to
                ensure that we are able to compete in a rapidly changing and
                global economy. We have seen how globalisation has led to a
                dramatic increase in the economic performance of the Southern
                economy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The key to this transformation was the
                creation of the initial conditions that are attractive to
                international capital in terms of stable labour costs, financial
                incentives, sound economic, political and legal structures and
                peace. However, there is also a negative side to globalisation.
                It leads to an increase in inequality, not only between
                countries but also within them. With the outsourcing of
                low-skilled manufacturing to developing countries, inequality
                tends to go hand in hand with globalisation. That does not mean
                that it is either acceptable or desirable. The challenge for us
                all is to consider how we can reap the benefits of
                globalisation, while also ensuring that poverty and inequality
                are not increased.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was in this context that the Committee
                addressed the specific set of problems facing the economy and
                made the many important recommendations in this report. I should
                make it clear that the recommendations are not a substitute for
                those made in the ‘Strategy 2010’ report itself. They are,
                in our view, the most appropriate to help tackle the challenges
                and opportunities presented in an increasingly global economy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will now turn to some of the important
                recommendations that we made in the report. We made two general
                recommendations — two key steps that are essential for the
                successful development of an economic development strategy. The
                first is to enhance greatly the role of the present Economic
                Development Forum. It should be responsible for the
                implementation of ‘Strategy 2010’ and for prioritising the
                recommendations. Its representation should be broadened, and it
                should include representatives from all relevant Government
                Departments, the higher and further education sector, district
                councils and a much greater representation from the voluntary
                and community sector. Its actions should be clear and
                transparent, and it should report on a regular basis to our
                Committee.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second key step involves the
                establishment of a partnership structure. A truly inclusive
                partnership is essential to any successful economic growth. If
                policies are not supported by a sense of shared ownership, they
                lead to the social exclusion of those whom they leave behind. We
                have recommended that the issues of partnership should encompass
                four aspects: social inclusion, equality, social partnership and
                transnational and international partnership.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee then made 37 detailed
                recommendations, which were grouped under five key themes:
                public sector and industrial development policy instruments,
                partnership and cohesion; the economic infrastructure; patterns
                of sectoral development; and the information infrastructure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On public sector issues, the Committee was
                concerned about the number of issues that were outside the
                control of the Assembly, but which were having a serious impact
                on businesses and the economy, such as the low rate of
                corporation tax in the South, the higher road fuel duty in the
                North, the proposed aggregates tax and the currency
                differentials with the South. The Barnett formula should be
                reviewed. There needs to be a much fairer system of determining
                the North’s block grant from the Treasury to help alleviate
                the impact of these disadvantages.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The disadvantages that I have just listed
                would be considerably eased if the Assembly were to have control
                over its own fiscal policy. We must consider the advantages and
                disadvantages of having fiscal flexibility and how such power
                could and should be used to create new and essential financial
                initiatives.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Banks need to take on a greater role in
                encouraging local enterprise and should provide a clear, open
                and transparent charging structure. The creative industries
                sector should be granted a tax exemption to help accelerate the
                enormous potential for growth in that sector. Small businesses
                should be assisted by a system of loans guaranteed by the
                Government, similar to the scheme operated by the US Small
                Business Administration. There are enormous opportunities for
                industry through the green industrial revolution. More focused
                research and development strategies are needed to support the
                development of new technology industries designed to enhance
                environmental protection and reduce global warming.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issue of a single development agency was
                raised by many of the organisations giving evidence. We support
                the establishment of a single development agency and have given
                a detailed response to the Minister on his consultation paper. A
                copy of that response is included in our report. We were
                encouraged that the Minister took on board many of the points
                made by the Committee during the consultation exercise. The
                Committee will, of course, be working with the Minister and also
                closely scrutinising the legislation which is required to set up
                the new body.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee made a number of other
                recommendations relating to fiscal and financial measures,
                including tax rules, the single European currency, selective
                financial assistance, innovation, design, marketing and export,
                regional disparities and clean, green production.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to partnership and cohesion, it
                is important that any sense of exclusion from the growth process
                be minimised for those whom the process does not touch at all,
                or touches only lightly. We have made a number of
                recommendations which will help to minimise any sense of social
                exclusion. First, unemployment is clearly still a major problem,
                and this point was made by a number of groups. The Committee
                believes that detailed studies are needed to examine why rates
                of long-term unemployment are substantially higher here than in
                Britain. The Committee was impressed by the success of the Fast
                Track to IT scheme in the South, which addresses the IT skills
                shortages while also creating opportunities for the long-term
                unemployed. We urge the Department to consider such a scheme.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Social responsibility incentives are needed
                to encourage greater social responsibility in business and
                industry with regard to their employment practices, their
                contribution to the local community and the environment and
                their approach to trade with newly industrialised and developing
                countries. Vulnerable groups require greater support for
                specialised training packages so that groups such as the
                disabled and ethnic minorities can have greater access to job
                skills and employment. There must be an increased focus on the
                recruitment and promotion of women in the work place, including
                targeted training for women, work place crèche facilities,
                increased access to job-share positions and greater use of
                family-friendly and flexible working hours.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee made other recommendations
                relating to partnership and cohesion, including poverty, studies
                on the social economy, economic interaction with the South of
                Ireland, stronger links with Europe, support for the social
                economy and local economic development.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On economic infrastructure, improvements to
                that infrastructure, which includes physical infrastructure,
                physical capital and human capital, are central to improving the
                productivity growth rate and, in turn, securing a better
                standard of living.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are serious deficiencies in the
                transport infrastructure. We need a massive injection of funding
                over the next 10 years in order to develop a world-class
                transport infrastructure in all regions.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a need for greater linkage between
                the further education sector and industry so that students can
                be better prepared for the knowledge-based economy. There also
                needs to be greater support for in-house training, particularly
                in sectors such as textiles, which are vulnerable to change. At
                secondary level, more needs to be done to improve the
                employability of students, particularly through career guidance,
                improved links with business and industry, a greater recognition
                of vocational studies and greater use of work placement in
                industry.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee also made a number of other
                recommendations relating to economic infrastructure, including a
                strategic approach to transport policy and the commercialisation
                of new technologies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The economic base has to change fundamentally
                if we are to compete more effectively in global markets and
                exploit the substantial benefits that could flow from closer
                integration with the southern economy in particular. We are
                currently too dependent on industries that produce low-quality,
                low-tech goods and have low levels of productivity. Foreign
                investment has a role to play, but it is more important to build
                strong, dynamic, indigenous industries. Studies should be
                carried out on how the economy can be transformed from one based
                on the manufacture of traditional low-value goods to one based
                on high-tech, high-value goods that will maximise the skills
                built up in the traditional sectors such as textiles and
                shipbuilding.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Policies should not only focus on
                manufacturing. There is an enormous potential for growth in the
                tourism sector. ‘Strategy 2010’ did not give sufficient
                emphasis to this sector. The new tourism strategic development
                plan needs to address the key issues in sectors such as
                hospitality training, marketing and recruitment challenges.
                Grants and financial incentives should be used to encourage the
                development of a market-focused approach.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee made a number of other
                recommendations relating to patterns of sectoral development,
                including small-and medium-sized businesses, the local service
                sector and the bed-and-breakfast sector.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The challenge is for the economy to develop
                quickly the type of information infrastructure that one would
                expect to find in a modern economy. Databases need to be
                prepared that will allow comparisons with other countries and
                regions in Europe. These databases will then enable economists
                to develop models that can be used to explore the effects of
                different policy scenarios.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee made other recommendations
                relating to information infrastructure, including data sources,
                a research agenda and an independent research group. The
                Committee accepts that responsibility for the delivery of the
                many recommendations in the report does not fall solely to the
                Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment. Other
                Departments have a role to play — not least the Department of
                Further and Higher Education, Training and Employment. The
                Committee believes that an expanded Economic Development Forum,
                chaired by the Minister and comprising representatives from all
                the relevant Government Departments, should be responsible for
                the implementation of the recommendations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Chairperson, I pay tribute to the hard
                work of my Committee Colleagues in bringing forward our report.
                I also thank the dedicated and hardworking staff who serviced
                the Committee. They were a great help and support to us. I
                commend the report to the Assembly and invite Members to support
                the motion.</p>

                contribute. For that reason, Members should limit their speeches
                to approximately eight minutes.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for
                Enterprise, Trade and Investment (Mr Neeson):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to thank our Committee Clerk, Cathie
                White, and her staff for their help in the compilation of this
                report. I also thank the Committee members. We are probably one
                of the hardest-working Committees of the Assembly; our
                commitment was such that we even met during the recess last
                summer.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is ironic that as we are having this
                debate, demonstrations are taking place in cities around the
                world against globalisation. Northern Ireland is now part of the
                global economy, and it is against that background that our
                report on ‘Strategy 2010’ should be viewed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">‘Strategy 2010’ is not an end in itself,
                but rather a means to an end. It is not written on tablets of
                stone, and it can be improved upon as the situation and the
                environment change. Our Committee carried out an extensive
                investigation involving many wide-ranging interests from all
                quarters of Northern Ireland. Perhaps we facilitated the
                wide-ranging consultation that should have been part of the
                process when the original document was being formulated.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report impinges on most of the Government
                Departments, and that is clear evidence of how this Assembly is
                now creating joined-up Government. I am very pleased by the
                public reaction to the publication of our report, which has come
                from many diverse areas. There are nearly 40 recommendations in
                the report, but I want to concentrate on the fiscal environment
                as well as on the needs of small businesses.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While ‘Strategy 2010’ has recommended
                that Northern Ireland should have a special rate of corporation
                tax in order to compete with the Republic of Ireland, the
                Committee has serious doubts about the feasibility of that.
                Members will be aware of my very strong wish that the Assembly
                should have tax-varying powers. However, the Committee believes
                that at this stage of the devolution process it is essential
                that Northern Ireland establish the extent to which it has
                control over fiscal policy and how that control may be used to
                create new and essential financial incentives. Throughout our
                consultations, the continual cry from the business community was
                for tax incentives in order to encourage new inward investment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee further believes that a much
                fairer system of determining Northern Ireland’s block grant is
                needed in order to help alleviate the impact on the economy of
                certain fiscal disadvantages. Coincidentally, when the Committee
                visited its counterpart in the National Assembly for Wales, we
                heard a similar plea. In fact, the Committee has now concluded
                that the Barnett formula, which determines Northern Ireland’s
                block grant from the Treasury, should be reviewed. However,
                Members should also be mindful of recent statements by the
                Deputy Prime Minister, John Prescott, about regional funding.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It will be an uphill battle, but this
                Assembly is only too aware of the serious underfunding of public
                services during the years of direct rule. The Committee,
                therefore, recommends that a joint delegation of Members from
                the Enterprise, Trade and Investment and the Finance and
                Personnel Committees should meet the Chancellor of the
                Exchequer. One has only to look at the debate that we had this
                morning on the foot-and-mouth crisis to see how two Committees
                of this Assembly can co-operate to deal with a very important
                issue. The Barnett issue is one on which we can work together.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the small business sector, I
                reiterate the Committee’s support for the creation of the
                single development agency. The Chairman has already outlined
                that there is a separate annex in our report relating to that.
                However, Members must realise that small businesses form the
                backbone of the Northern Ireland economy and will continue to do
                so.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Last August the cross-party trade group
                visited North America with the Minister, Sir Reg Empey, and we
                were impressed by the operation of the Small Business
                Administration in the United States. Small businesses in the
                United States benefit from loans guaranteed and operated by the
                Government. The diverse range of businesses which benefit was
                noticeable, and I am pleased to say that there is a very low
                rate of default in the repayment of the loans.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Equally important to myself and to the other
                Committee members is the fact that that scheme encouraged many
                women into business. Indeed, the majority of uptakes were by
                women. In Northern Ireland there are not only problems for women
                becoming involved in business but also for their becoming
                involved in politics. Anything that the Assembly can do to
                encourage women into business should be taken on board.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee recommends that the new
                industrial development agency adopt a highly selective policy to
                foster an enterprise culture throughout Northern Ireland. It is
                hoped that that will be addressed when the new agency is
                established.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am also pleased with the Minister’s
                commitment to local economic development. At the recent seminar
                in Dunadry, representatives from local government were equally
                impressed by that commitment to ensure that there is a role for
                local economic development in Northern Ireland. The report is a
                constructive and positive effort to ensure that Northern Ireland
                can benefit from the economic opportunities that are out there.
                I support the motion.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is an important debate, and it is to be
                regretted that relatively few Members have stayed to take part
                in, or listen to, it. The Enterprise, Trade and Investment
                Committee’s inquiry into ‘Strategy 2010’ has been in-depth
                and far-reaching. The Committee has consulted widely and sought
                views on all aspects of economic development. The Committee’s
                commitment in reaching this stage is unquestionable, with
                evidence- taking sessions being held during the 2000 summer
                recess. Many written and oral submissions have been noted, and
                useful and valid points have been welcomed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee members recognise the
                importance of tourism to the economy of Northern Ireland; it is
                nothing short of vital. There is a wide acceptance that there is
                now huge potential in this sphere, but much still needs to be
                done and to be achieved if Northern Ireland is to grasp fully
                the tourist opportunities that await.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Paragraph 3.20 on page 24 of volume 1 of the
                Committee’s report states that</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Evidence from service sector groups
                (hotels and tourism) suggested that their problems had been
                largely neglected&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is something to be regretted, and it is
                hoped that the Committee’s inquiry has redressed that
                perceived imbalance.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is of paramount importance that the
                problems faced by Northern Ireland’s tourism industry over
                recent years be overturned with a new vision of opportunity,
                high standards, excellence and delivery.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the evidence that has been gathered from
                the tourism sector groups, the consensus appears to be that the
                island should be marketed as a whole. Tourists from North
                America or other far-flung regions of the world are less attuned
                to the fact that this island comprises two jurisdictions. It is
                therefore imperative that, in the first instance, we attract as
                many people as possible to the island. This can be achieved by
                flying tourists into Aldergrove, Shannon or Dublin. It then
                becomes incumbent on the Northern Ireland Tourist Board to sell
                the Northern Ireland product to the many and varied visitors.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Northern&nbsp;Ireland has a unique product.
                The Province has a distinct advantage over the Republic of
                Ireland, because it boasts the single most recognisable feature
                on this island — the Giants Causeway.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In volume one of the report on the ‘Strategy
                2010’ inquiry, recommendation 32 states</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The Committee recommends that the
                tourism sector should be encouraged and supported with grants
                and financial incentives in developing a market-focused
                approach. This approach should centre on the establishment of a
                brand image for Northern&nbsp;Ireland and should encourage
                demand for shoulder and off-peak seasons.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The establishment of a brand image is vital
                to the creation of a strong and successful tourism industry.
                Further to recommendation&nbsp;31, the tourism sector should
                address key issues such as hospitality training and recruitment
                challenges. We all know that world tourism is a highly
                competitive market. We cannot offer a product which is basked in
                sunshine — if only every day in this Province were like today.
                It is therefore all the more vital that we offer a very
                market-focused approach that meets the necessity of shoulder and
                off-peak vacation opportunities. In this respect, events tourism
                is the way forward. We need only consider the success of such
                events as the North West 200, the Black Bush Golf Tournament and
                the Milk Cup soccer tournament. Running alongside all of this is
                the important, and often undervalued, necessity of high
                standards.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we are to compete successfully in a world
                marketplace, we must pay great attention to the need to deliver
                a product that is on a par with any major tourist destination in
                the world. When we attract people to Northern Ireland we want
                them to return, and we want them to spread the word to others.
                This will happen only if they are impressed with what is being
                offered and with the standards and product-delivery mentality of
                those who operate in the industry.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee recommended a massive injection
                of funding over the next 10&nbsp;years to develop the transport
                infrastructure in all regions of Northern&nbsp;Ireland. This
                goes hand in hand with the development of tourism. There is a
                need for fast, safe and efficient public transport. The need for
                good infrastructure and communications networks can not be
                emphasised enough in our battle to enhance tourism. The
                connection speaks for itself.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, as the world becomes increasingly
                smaller to the extent that far-off parts of the world are now
                becoming commonplace destinations for the avid traveller, we
                must do everything possible to make it easy for people from
                those far-flung destinations to visit Northern Ireland. There is
                a need not only to market our product on new and distant shores,
                but to provide the means for people to get here. That means
                constantly keeping an eye on potential new air routes and
                destinations. What I have suggested, and the recommendations
                made by the Committee’s inquiry, are common sense, visionary
                proposals for the betterment of Northern&nbsp;Ireland in the
                years ahead. I urge the House to support the motion.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr McDonnell:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Much of the ground has been covered, but I
                will elaborate on issues which require further emphasis, filling
                in the gaps in earlier speeches. It cannot be emphasised enough
                how extensive this investigation was and how much detail we went
                into.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was more than 12 months in gestation. The
                Chairperson of the Enterprise, Trade and Investment Committee
                mentioned earlier that we had 58 written and 45 verbal
                submissions. I began with some scepticism and concerns that
                consultation on ‘Strategy 2010’ was perhaps, as many people
                thought, too narrow. Over the course of the lengthy inquiry,
                however, it became obvious that, while there were some
                shortcomings in the preparation and the consultation, it was one
                of the most valuable documents I had seen. I could not help but
                draw the conclusion that it was a major milestone in the process
                of readjusting and reorientating our economy towards the
                twenty-first century.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That reorientation has taken place in
                extremely difficult circumstances. The Chairperson earlier
                referred to globalisation. Globalisation has been the name of
                the game in the last 10 years, if not the last 15. The whole
                world has changed and become a village. We can no longer operate
                in isolation, as we could perhaps have done in the past with the
                grants, the protection, the shelter and the subsidies.
                Businesses developed in such circumstances will ultimately be
                swept away in the globalised economy of the twenty-first
                century.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We recognise that in that environment
                Northern Ireland must be able to create an economy that will
                enable it to change rapidly in rapidly changing circumstances.
                Financial capital relentlessly follows opportunity and
                ruthlessly seeks out niches where it might create wealth,
                develop itself and return a profit. It does not hold much
                sentiment. In those circumstances we must be able to compete
                with, but equally to balance, the ruthlessness of capitalism as
                it seeks its opportunities. Some countries have done very well
                in this, and in our report we mentioned particularly South Korea
                and the Irish Republic. They have managed to create human
                capital to take advantage of the financial capital which was
                moving around the world and suck it in.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Financial capital does seek very solid
                quality and quantity of human capital and other capital stocks,
                such as infrastructure, in which to root itself. However, quite
                often as it does this, a &quot;winner takes all&quot; situation
                develops and inequality becomes the norm — not just between
                countries but in them. We can see this at home west of the Bann
                and in the Greater Belfast region, which has special advantages
                in contexts such as telecommunications, while places like
                Strabane may not. Equally, in Southern Ireland the Greater
                Dublin region is prospering and has the &quot;Celtic tiger&quot;
                by the tail, but perhaps places west of the Shannon do not see
                things in the same context. Recently I was able to look at
                northern Virginia, which has almost become a new San José,
                while southern Virginia is still impoverished and follows the
                traditions of the old south.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the context of globalisation, it is vital
                that we ask ourselves what roles our Government, Executive and
                Ministers should play in the economy to enable us to reap the
                best benefits for our people. Our report justified my view that
                the quality of Government intervention is much more important
                than the quantity. In other words, the Government should
                effectively steer the ship without necessarily firing all the
                furnaces or shovelling all the coal.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Others have mentioned the fiscal situation.
                We need to create the correct financial climate in order to
                attract inward investment. We have to make the appropriate
                choices, and our public sector needs to have the right attitude
                and sense of purpose. We have moved far beyond nineteenth and
                twentieth century circumstances and into the twenty-first
                century, in which everything is about partnerships. It is about
                people bringing different parts of the equation to the table and
                everyone’s being better off. The Committee’s view is that it
                is important for there to be a partnership between the
                &quot;gainers&quot; and the &quot;losers&quot;. The last thing
                that we want in our small community is to have one section which
                is well off while another — those not in a position to benefit
                from the advantages that change has brought — loses out. We
                have to create a situation in which social sensitivity exists.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recommendation 9 mentioned innovation, which
                I cannot emphasise strongly enough. Our businesses do not spend
                enough on innovation compared with those of other countries.
                Whether it be the textile industry or others, we are too slow
                off the mark, and perhaps that is the lesson to be learnt from
                the partial demise of our textile industry. We still have a
                major opportunity to obtain business and employment in which we
                are producing quality for niche markets.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Others have dealt with the single development
                agency, and I commend the Minister for his efforts in that
                direction. I must emphasise that it was the view of most of my
                Colleagues in the Committee that the single development agency

                every opportunity. I would like to speak on, had I the
                opportunity, other issues such as equality and fairness. I could
                touch on the whole economic infrastructure for regional
                development. We must penetrate new technology and use that

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would acknowledge the work of the Committee
                in producing the second report, and I appreciate the opportunity
                for debate on the economy. It is more than two years since the
                ‘Strategy 2010’ report was produced. We have implemented
                some of the recommendations; some are under review; some are
                awaiting action. It is difficult to know the original document’s
                current status. However, no work would be complete without
                linking the ‘Strategy 2010’ report to the transportation
                issue and to the regional strategic framework (RSF) document. It
                is imperative that all three are dovetailed and that we have a
                cohesive strategy. We need to devise or identify a mechanism to
                deliver such a strategy in the context of globalisation of the
                economy.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The debate is useful, and there are some
                issues confronting us. Reference has already been made to the
                challenge of getting this right — a challenge facing all of us
                in the Assembly. Many of the people we represent are waiting for
                leadership and guidance and for the vital decisions to be made
                so that they can improve their quality of life and have job
                security and stability.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The need for links between education and
                business is outlined in recommendations 26 and 27 of the report.
                The original ‘Strategy 2010’ document identified that a
                clearer focus is needed for the further and higher education
                sector in the provision of vocational training. In the higher
                education sector we have a clear academic route and some
                research and development, which is invaluable in supporting the
                economy. However, we need to have vocational training as the
                primary focus in our further education sector, as identified in
                ‘Strategy 2010’. This is something that we still have to
                work on. We have made some progress, but there is still much
                more to be done. As the Minister of Higher and Further
                Education, Training and Employment is not here, the question of
                the current position on this issue will have to be left hanging.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is also the issue of the current system
                of career guidance, which I believe is vital in guiding young
                people and students on their future employment pathway. A review
                has been initiated, and an interim report was due in January. I
                stand to be corrected, but I cannot recall ever having seen that
                report. What is the present position of that report? If it has
                not been produced, when will it be available?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Links between education and business are
                vital throughout all levels of education even into training
                programmes. We must aim at providing a seamless programme so
                that there will be no dislocation in the education and training
                aspect of preparing people for work. There must also be a clear
                understanding that education and training must be geared towards
                the skill demands of industry. Some steps have been taken to
                bring that about, but more work must be done.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In my constituency of Upper Bann and in
                Craigavon, in particular, only one inward investment project was
                located in the borough of Craigavon in the period of the
                Northern Ireland Single Programming Document (SPD) 1994 to 1999.
                There is a danger that our TSN status might unwittingly deter
                some inward investment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Areas such as this should not be
                disadvantaged or deprived of inward investment because of their
                position in TSN league tables. There is a further danger in that
                a rigorous implementation of TSN policies could affect adversely
                the economic growth of areas such as Craigavon. Setbacks to
                traditional industries such as textiles, in which jobs have been
                lost, could be encountered and a serious increase in
                unemployment could result. We should be careful that, in trying
                to bring about the equality issues and opportunities that we all
                support, the pendulum does not swing too far, causing a problem
                where hitherto there was none.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If local businesses are to prosper, they must
                have a level playing field and be provided with natural gas. The
                main urban areas in Upper Bann are Craigavon and Banbridge;
                however, it is not only those areas that will benefit. There
                will be a sub-regional benefit for the whole south-east area of
                the Province.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a number of Members have withdrawn from
                the debate, I can expand speaking time to 10 minutes. I
                apologise for not informing you sooner, Mr Carrick, but I would
                have been able to make the revision earlier had the Whips
                informed me that some Members had withdrawn their names.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Morrice:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I commend the report. I thank the Committee
                Clerk, the support staff, researchers and advisers for their
                patience, diligence and very sterling work. I also thank the
                groups that gave written and oral presentations. Their input was
                absolutely invaluable to our consultation process. I thank the
                Chairperson, the Deputy Chairperson and the members of the
                Committee for making our deliberations interesting and very
                enjoyable.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was no easy task. The territory covered by
                economic policy is massive. If social issues are also included
                — as they were — the task is nothing short of gigantic. It
                covers almost every Government Department from transport and
                health to education, culture and leisure. Very few Departments
                escape the umbrella of economic development.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The most important message that I want to
                come out of the Committee report is that economic development
                can never operate as a stand-alone policy. Economic and social
                development must always go hand in hand. The wealth of a nation
                should not be measured by gross national product alone. Other
                indices mentioned by the Chairperson such as long-term
                unemployment, child poverty, inequality and deprivation should
                also be used to measure growth so that we can never again fall
                into that terrible trap of widening the gap between the haves
                and the have-nots. The success of this region must be measured
                as much by its quality of life as by its quantity of production.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second message that I would like to give
                involves the culture that surrounds economic development. Very
                few Members would disagree that a fear-of-failure mentality has
                crippled our ability to move forward fast and has condemned us
                to playing second fiddle to all other industrial regions of the
                world. Countries as far away as South Korea, which Dr McDonnell
                mentioned, or as close as our nearest neighbour, the Republic,
                are shining examples of how it can be done. However, we must be
                prepared to take risks.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The aim must be to achieve a socially and
                geographically balanced approach to economic development, while
                learning and growing through increased co-operation and
                interaction with our closest neighbours at home, in Europe and
                further afield. Where do we begin? This report, as Mr Neeson
                said, provides a starting point by making recommendations that
                give the go-ahead for a thoroughly modern approach to the change
                that is taking place in the global economy. That change will
                overtake us if we do not act now and act fast. All we need is
                the combined wisdom of our Executive and the newly inclusive
                Economic Development Forum, which was one of our
                recommendations, to start weaving the parts together to drive
                Northern Ireland plc full steam ahead.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Mr Carrick said, many people are waiting
                for guidance and leadership from us. It might, therefore, be
                useful at this stage to offer a few helpful hints on what we in
                the Northern Ireland Women’s Coalition believe are the most
                important recommendations to come from this report, the
                recommendations that would, if implemented, help to push the
                buttons to get us to where we want to be. I will not give the
                points in any order of preference.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, I would like to consider the issue of
                quality of life. We should begin by directing our modern
                industrial development to those areas that can contribute to the
                well-being of society here and on the global scale. I am
                referring to the promotion of clean, green technologies and life
                and health technologies. It has been said many times that we
                have a highly educated population, so why should our research
                hospitals and our universities not be the first to discover a
                cure for cancer or foot-and-mouth disease? Why can our old
                established industries like Harland and Wolff not pioneer the
                irreversible move into new and renewable energy sources in the
                area of offshore wind? Tourism should also be touched on. Work
                is already being done on this, and I commend that, but more
                needs to be on branding and the other issues that Mr McClarty
                raised.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, I want to look at the beauty, the
                value and the fun of innovation, design and creativity. Why can
                our reputation as the world’s leading textile manufacturer not
                be channelled into the high-value fashion market? Irish linen is
                getting there in spite of us, but it needs our help.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What about advertising, film making,
                television production, dance, music and sport? Those are all
                areas where we have huge creative, artistic and sporting talent,
                but they have succeeded with little or no help from us. Is it
                not time that we turned our attention to our talent instead of
                always believing that success can be bought only with a plane
                ticket? I am talking about our young people going abroad to find
                success elsewhere or investors coming in because they offer more
                than our local industry. I am not knocking inward investment —
                it is valuable — but we must start looking at the wealth of
                what we have here.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.00 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What about our young people? Our education
                system attempts to teach them to pass exams but gives them no
                knowledge or skills relevant to business or enterprise culture.
                A researcher in that area, Brian Cummins said</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Those who engage in policy
                implementation, including school education, must accept that
                they cannot remain as spectators of change but realise the
                valuable contribution that enterprise education can play in
                addressing current and future needs&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Further education establishments and schools
                at secondary and primary level are all willing and ready to play
                their part; we must give them a chance.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another important area of change that was
                mentioned by the Chairperson of the Enterprise, Trade and
                Investment Committee relates to the increasing number of women
                in the workplace, the need to accommodate that and the changing
                family circumstances that that implies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I mentioned change, and one area that we can
                no longer ignore is the single European currency. Whatever our
                stance on the issue, we must begin to look seriously at and
                prepare for any detrimental effects of the arrival of the single
                currency on our doorstep on 1 January. That applies not only to
                our trade with these partners but also to inward investment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, the promotion of business that
                treats its workforce with respect, provides opportunity for all,
                particularly the most marginalised, and makes a contribution to
                its community is a vital ingredient in the new modern, socially
                responsible culture. The value of the social economy and the
                non-governmental organisation sector must not be underestimated.
                The report gives the go-ahead for these things to happen. All we
                need now is the vision, imagination and confidence to make it
                all happen and to take the risk.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Birnie:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I congratulate the Enterprise, Trade and
                Investment Committee on the product of considerable work. In a
                sense a careful and politically led consideration of ‘Strategy
                2010’ has, in fact, been long overdue. ‘Strategy 2010’
                described itself as having some of the characteristics of a
                draft that, in due course, would be recommended to what was to
                be a new devolved level of Government in Northern Ireland. It is
                sad that circumstances, during the course of 1999 and 2000,
                meant that some bits of the strategy have had to, perforce, be
                implemented, or implemented in part, ahead of having a
                democratic debate through the politicians on what the strategy
                should actually include. The Committee has now — this is very
                welcome — begun the work of making economic policy more
                accountable.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report rightly goes through a wide range
                of factors that are considered to be possible causes of a
                regions’ rate of economic growth. As Chairperson of the Higher
                and Further Education, Training and Employment Committee, could
                I also add that that Committee hopes, in due course and in some
                detail, to report on the contribution of so-called human
                capital, particularly training, and the availability of skilled
                labour and the contribution of that to economic development.
                Therefore there will be, in a sense, a dovetailing with the
                recent report.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">‘Strategy 2010’ was certainly noble in
                its intent, but it was clearly characterised by a number of
                problems, some of which have been well summarised here today.
                Paragraph 9 in the executive summary of the report outlines the
                difficulties.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let me highlight just one of those
                difficulties — and here I will draw on my professional
                experience from before I entered the realm of elected politics.
                ‘Strategy 2010’ was conceived as a regional economic
                development study, but it was constructed without serious
                consultation with economic experts or economists from outside
                what was then the Department of Economic Development. That is a
                rather strange way of going about devising an economic strategy.
                It is like the Admiralty designing a new battleship or aircraft
                carrier without making any reference to naval architects.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of course, a strategy should not be an
                exercise in creating an abstract economic thesis. In some ways,
                perhaps, the over-theoretical sophistication of some economists
                partly explains why nobody wants to talk to them. However,
                ideally, the strategy should have been somewhat informed by
                sound economic analysis. In its process of construction there
                was not a wide enough and sufficiently well structured
                consultation process — as the Deputy Chairperson of the
                Enterprise, Trade and Investment Committee has already said.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since I have limited time, I will not simply
                list the many recommendations in the report that I am in
                complete agreement with. Rather, I shall highlight three areas
                where there is room for differing nuances and emphases.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, in paragraph 11 of the executive
                summary there is a recommendation for a much-expanded role for
                the Economic Development Forum. Over recent years there has been
                a tremendous multiplication of forums in Northern Ireland,
                particularly in the business field that we are considering
                today. However, the economy’s most urgent need is for
                entrepreneurs and managers to start, build and expand companies
                that provide the products and services that the world wants.
                Action is needed, not simply more talking.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would have thought that we could have been
                confident that a combination of the Committee, the Civic Forum
                and the business and trade union representatives on the Northern
                Ireland Economic Council, alongside the Minister and the
                Executive as a whole, would be sufficient to provide democratic
                accountability and/or sectional representation in the devising
                and implementation of policy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My second point relates to the review of
                fiscal incentives — recommendations 1, 3 and 7, for example. I
                am glad that a review has taken place. There will obviously be
                differing views, some of which are contained in the various
                volumes of evidence, on the desirability of a Southern-style
                system of very low rates of corporate profit taxation. There is
                clear evidence of the need to rebalance state support to
                companies away from grant assistance to physical capital and
                toward &quot;softer&quot; assets such as research and
                development, management, consultancy and design.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Moreover, there is now little doubt — and
                evidence of this was presented to the Committee — that during
                the direct rule period, industrial policy often had the perverse
                consequence of subsidising and, therefore, encouraging corporate
                inefficiency. Taking industrial grants — from IDB, LEDU and so
                on — as a percentage of company profits or of value added,
                Northern Ireland for many years had the dubious distinction of
                being the most grant-dependent region in Europe, west of the
                former Communist bloc.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recommendation 37 of the report relates to
                the Northern Ireland Economic Council. I entirely endorse the
                sentiment regarding the importance of economic research that is
                provided somewhat at arm’s length from the general
                administrative and Government machine. I have a slight, albeit
                non-financial interest here, since that is an area that I used
                to work in about 12 years ago.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am less sure of the recommendation that is
                contained in the Committee’s report to add a regional and
                economic forecasting role to the Northern Ireland Economic
                Council, as economic forecasts have been carried out since the
                late 1980s by the separate research body, the Northern Ireland
                Economic Research Centre.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issue of independent economic advice to
                the Government, and by implication to us as Assembly Members, is
                the subject of an ongoing review. I am a little concerned that
                the report might be seen to be prejudging some aspects of the
                results of that review, although I entirely endorse the
                underlying theme of the value of and need to maintain
                independent sources of strategic economic analysis and good
                sources of independent statistics.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Notwithstanding those three points of
                qualification, I welcome this report in the round. It is a good
                start to the process of re-engineering ‘Strategy 2010’.
                Since 1990, Northern Ireland’s output and employment growth
                performance has certainly surpassed the United Kingdom average
                by a substantial margin, but the challenge now is to build, so
                as to continue and maintain that achievement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGrady:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Like other Members before me, I commend the
                Chairperson and the Committee for carrying out a very difficult
                task and for the panoramic view they have given us of the way
                forward in industrial development and social well-being. I would
                like to think that it is not a wish list, but that it will be
                further honed down and developed into a series of enterprises
                that are properly prioritised and, equally important, properly
                funded to be capable of implementation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is in a sense a vade mecum of where we are
                going in economic and social terms, and for that reason it is a
                very important document. Dr Birnie has dealt with the origins of
                this paper, and I well remember very severe criticisms being
                made of the 2010 document because of its lack of external input
                and expertise from other fields. However, that can be addressed
                as time goes on.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One is not qualified to be categorical in any
                one area, but the question of the land border between ourselves
                and the Republic of Ireland is a very big subject given the
                differential in taxes and duties and the potential differential
                in coinage. How that will affect us needs to be addressed much
                more fundamentally than it has been in this document. It would
                be tempting to go down that avenue with fiscal flexibility, the
                Barnett formula and tax duties, but I must resist that because
                we will be trapped for eternity if we address these lofty
                issues. I will leave that for another time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have taken one or two areas which time will
                allow me to address. The first is recommendation 13 on regional
                disparities. This is a very complex issue, particularly if we
                are looking at a strategy based on a knowledge-driven economic
                society. If information technology is going to be the central
                plank of the strategy to dispense with regional disparities, IT
                education must be decentralised, particularly at university
                level. Graduates will naturally be the focus of most IT
                companies, and the only way to ensure inward investment in
                regions that have not yet received it is to create a local pool.
                Quite frankly, the current provision of HND and HNC at these
                levels may not be adequate.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important to address this in another
                context as well. The real meaning of wealth is well-being.
                Well-being is not based on economic factors alone, it also
                relates to social factors. We must create a new society in which
                that well-being exists. Everyone agrees that long-term
                unemployment is a primary issue which needs to be tackled first
                but, in reality, it is difficult to go about doing this.
                Recommendation 16 of the report notes that employers are
                reluctant to recruit the long-term unemployed. There are
                economic disincentives in social security and welfare benefits,
                and the skills base still needs to be addressed. In addressing
                the lack of skills, the report refers once again to IT, but we
                cannot all participate in this field. There must be other skills
                from which people can earn a good living. While addressing the
                IT deficit, we must also address the lack of general skills.
                Many of the long-term unemployed would not be comfortable in an
                IT-based job. We must look beyond IT, even though it is
                fashionable today.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the concept of a tax exemption for
                creative industries, a sector which could assist regional
                decentralisation. We have an enormous wealth of talent in the
                creative industries which we have yet to harvest. This is not
                just a cultural issue, but an economic matter, and there is
                enormous potential for export if the cultural industry is
                approached on a full economic basis.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The tourism industry was mentioned by one or
                two Members. In such a broad, panoramic paper there must be
                something that has not been emphasised — the potential of
                tourism has been under-emphasised. We speak about tourism all
                the time, and we all support the concept of boosting that
                industry, but we need to get down to brass tacks. A new economic
                development agency which has been set up will devote some of its
                energies to key inward investment in the tourism sector.
                However, the agency must be driven, it must be financed and it
                must have specific targets to deliver a strong tourist industry.
                If it were properly dealt with, tourism could become the second
                largest base industry in Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recommendation 22 addresses support for the
                social economy. The recommendation, and the Executive’s
                synopsis of it, relate once again to the local economy. The
                linked issues of regional disparity and long-term unemployment,
                which emerge once again in this recommendation, can only be
                dealt with if the local economy is addressed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not recall which recommendation deals
                with partnership, but partnership must be all-embracing. It must
                incorporate all forms of representatives and elected personnel
                if the concept of inclusiveness is to take on its true meaning.
                There is also the practical argument that the more people you
                seek ideas from, the better are the ideas you get.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is time that we removed the financial cap
                on local government spending in the economic development sector.
                This would allow local politicians who represent the rate payers
                — those who contribute to the funding — to make more
                fundamental decisions which address the market failure in many
                districts.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Referring back to the IT syndrome, the
                location of technology centres needs to be more dispersed, with
                greater emphasis on areas outside the cosmopolitan areas of
                Belfast, Derry or any other area that aspires to such a
                description. You can get away from that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unemployment is another issue. The only
                suggestion that I found in that synopsis was that the Committee
                would urge the Department to consider the fast track to
                information technology (FIT). As a group, the long-term
                unemployed are not all going to be accommodated by that. We must
                broaden the concept of how we enhance the skills and retrain the
                unemployed with IT abilities, and also with other abilities, if
                we are to tackle the long-term unemployment issue properly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is a social contract, and many issues
                will need to be honed down and developed. Each time a decision
                is made to pursue a particular priority, the financial resources
                must be identified and considered at the same time in order that
                the practicality of the implementation is carried out. These
                recommendations and their development should not simply be a
                wish list of things to be done in the future, without hope of
                implementation.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr M Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am sure I do not need to remind Members
                that the next decade will be one of massive change to the
                economic infrastructure of our society. The old labour-intensive
                industries, such as shipbuilding and textile manufacturing, are
                slowly being replaced by new industries. One need only look to
                companies such as Nortel to see how this is the case. All over
                the world this cycle of decline in the old industries and
                rejuvenation through the new service providers is being
                repeated. It is vital that we in Northern Ireland embrace the
                changes taking place in the world markets to ensure that we
                offer an attractive, competitive and first-class destination for
                would-be investors.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to take this opportunity to
                place on record my own support for the proposals outlined in the
                ‘Strategy 2010’ document. The proposals as outlined in
                section 9 of the document are innovative, but they are also
                realistic and achievable aims which can ensure the continuance
                of the economic renaissance which Northern Ireland has seen in
                the last few years. I shall focus my remarks today on section 9
                of the report, which outlines the recommendations of the
                steering group. One of the recommendations that grabbed my
                attention is contained in the skills and education section of
                the report, page 150, in which the authors recommend that</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;A valued sub-degree level vocational
                educational programmes should be established.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In my view this has much to do with raising
                the value, both in the eyes of employers and of students who may
                wish to undertake such a course, of the current GNVQ
                qualification. The fact of the matter is that although it
                carries the equivalent value of two A levels, the GNVQ is
                scorned as a qualification. This is most unsatisfactory. Young
                people who take up these courses must be assured that their
                qualifications are of value and will guarantee them a fair
                chance when they do enter the employment market.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another of the recommendations of the
                steering group is contained under the section entitled ‘Innovation’,
                page 158. In this section they say</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;There should be a campaign to promote
                innovation and good design.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The importance of being seen on the
                international stage as a place where technological innovation
                and improvement are rapidly evolving is vital if Northern
                Ireland is to hold its own in an increasingly dynamic world
                market. The Government cannot simply sit back and hope for great
                genius and design to come forth. They must take an active part
                in encouraging companies to diversify and invest in research and
                new techniques, and the commencement of such a campaign would be
                an excellent start. The campaign could take the form of a
                charter mark as established under the previous Tory Government
                and awarded for excellence, or perhaps an incentive to the
                company proven to be most innovative and forward-looking.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the most interesting recommendations
                is contained in the section entitled ‘The Planning System’,
                page 178. In this section we read that the steering group
                recommends that the Assembly introduce a rates regime which
                helps to nurture small, indigenous retail businesses. One can
                only assume that by &quot;nurture small, indigenous
                businesses&quot; the authors of this document did not mean
                &quot;cripple many of them with a massive 8% rates rise&quot;.
                The ordinary shopkeepers in my constituency remember who is to
                blame for this and no doubt will deliver their verdict come the
                elections. There is, however, much in this report to be
                welcomed. Many of the proposals are constructive and well
                thought out, and I have no hesitation in recommending its
                adoption by the House.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Carson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Committee’s report on the ‘Strategy
                2010’ document and commend the Committee for the work and
                ideas on what it deems is required for the strategy’s
                implementation in Northern Ireland. This is an opportunity for
                the Assembly, its Committees and all the Departments to grasp
                what this Committee has recommended and to endeavour to see that
                its recommendations are implemented. We have seen from many
                previous Committee reports the need for devolved government, and
                this is a further example of how that can be improved on. It is
                a vast job for our elected Members, but after a 30-year vacuum
                it is a golden opportunity for us all to do something. We had
                the luxury of apportioning blame on others before this — we
                could blame the Northern Ireland Office and Secretaries of State
                — but now it is our opportunity to address the problems that
                really concern Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I echo the Committee’s concern on the three
                issues where we in Northern Ireland are at a distinct
                disadvantage to the rest of the United Kingdom because of the
                proximity of the Republic of Ireland and the border. The
                Republic of Ireland has lower corporation tax, lower fuel prices
                and road tax and the damaging currency differential, which is a
                big problem.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are 37 detailed recommendations, and a
                number are worthy of mention. Recommendation 12 — on a single
                development agency incorporating the IDB, LEDU and the
                Industrial Research and Technology Unit — will streamline the
                provision of aid to business and reduce wasteful duplication,
                which can only be a positive step.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the environmental issues, I agree with the
                enhanced environmental protection. Industries should be
                encouraged towards clean, green production methods, using
                alternative energy if possible, and to work for a reduction in
                waste production.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recommendation 10 is important, and business
                and industry should take note. The recent Northern Ireland Waste
                Arisings Survey Report by the Environment and Heritage Service (EHS)
                pointed out that waste collection, processing and disposal is
                costing Northern Ireland business more than £45 million per
                year. Fewer than one in three companies are taking effective
                steps to minimise the impact of waste on their business profits.
                The environment is a very important aspect of our life, and
                caring for our environment will not only help to reduce the
                negative impact of pollution on the environment in which we
                live, but it should also save businesses money if they take the
                recommendations on board.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recommendation 11 is an important step in
                recognising that the development of new technology industries
                can be designed to enhance environmental protection and reduce
                global warming while remaining profitable. In my constituency,
                the research and development of a biogas plant has been ongoing
                in Fivemiletown. That development hopes to have a number of
                uses, producing three saleable products — electricity, heat
                and bio-fertilisers. If operational, it will benefit the whole
                local community and the environment by recycling waste material.
                More research and development in similar environmental
                technologies would benefit the environmental and economic life
                of Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recommendations 31 to 33 will help build on
                our economic strengths in the tourism sector. Fermanagh and
                South Tyrone should benefit from this, as a fully co-ordinated
                strategy will help the overall aim of a partnership approach on
                economic development through a sustainable approach to tourism.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This should focus on a quality product and a
                quality service. The Fermanagh and South Tyrone constituency has
                much to offer with the fishing lakes, boating and the friendly
                bed-and-breakfast accommodation — the whole historic character
                of the constituency. Through the implementation of this report,
                we should be in a better position to take advantage of economic
                benefits for tourism.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In conclusion, this report has the potential
                to benefit the whole of Northern Ireland. It should not gather
                dust but should be acted upon. I support the motion.</p>

                </i><b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Courtney:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the opportunity to take part in
                this debate. As has already been stated, ‘Strategy 2010’ was
                published by the Department in March 1999 and, following its
                publication, serious concerns were expressed about it. As the
                Chairperson has stated, it was because of this that the
                Committee launched its inquiry.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am a relative newcomer to the Committee,
                having joined it in January 2001, and at that stage the first
                inquiry draft was just completed. It was followed by a second
                and a third draft. I say this to give some idea of its scope and
                of the painstaking way in which the inquiry was conducted. This
                was of course in stark contrast to the consultation that took
                place on the original ‘Strategy 2010’ document. I thank the
                Enterprise, Trade and Investment Committee staff for all their
                help.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The criticism of the original ‘Strategy
                2010’ document was that there were too many unstructured
                recommendations — 62 in total. The Committee has made 37
                detailed and two general recommendations, but I intend to
                concentrate on the two relating to skills and education —
                recommendations 26 and 27.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee recommends a system of
                education that releases the potential of all children, reduces
                the failure culture, improves access to employment through
                careers guidance, enhances links with business and industry,
                gives more recognition to vocational studies and makes greater
                use of work placement in industry. It also recommends greater
                links between the further education sector and industry,
                particularly with a view to preparing students for new skills to
                accommodate the knowledge-based economy, increased support for
                in-house training at all levels and reskilling courses,
                particularly for those sectors, such as textiles, which are
                particularly vulnerable to changes. These recommendations have
                the support of the trade unions and educational bodies. Courses
                within the educational establishment need to be customised to
                make changes in the workplace and the knowledge-based economy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There should be stronger working links
                between the further education sector and the Department of
                Enterprise, Trade and Investment agencies. We already have
                evidence of that when we see the Minister of Further and Higher
                Education, Training and Employment, Sean Farren, and the
                Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment, Sir Reg Empey,
                travelling to Europe and America seeking jobs and inward
                investment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We support an economic development strategy
                that informs the education and training policy and its funding
                delivery mechanisms. For too long, colleges have been left to
                make provision for courses and qualifications with inadequate
                market intelligence. Partnership is the key between schools,
                colleges and relevant businesses in order that the necessary
                skills are taught.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There needs to be greater support for
                in-house training within sectors, such as the textile industry,
                which are very vulnerable to change. Even in this past week, we
                have seen further job losses at Desmonds in Derry. This type of
                training needs to start sooner rather than later, if we are to
                have a sound economy. We need to be proactive rather than
                reactive, and we need to monitor carefully the implementation of
                these recommendations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To finish, I would like to highlight two
                other recommendations that are close to my heart. The first one,
                which has already been highlighted by my Colleague Eddie McGrady
                is tax exemption for the creative industries. This is a very
                important recommendation. We recommend a tax exemption for
                artists and crafts people in creative industry in Northern
                Ireland. At the moment, when we are talking about developing
                cultural quarters in all the major cities, this is an excellent
                recommendation and one that the House should support.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The other recommendation concerns women in
                the workplace. We recommend an increased focus on the
                recruitment and promotion of women in the workplace, including
                targeted training for women, workplace crèche facilities,
                increased access to job-share and greater use of family-friendly
                and flexible working hours. Thankfully, that is happening now in
                more places than it used to, particularly in hospitals, but it
                is something that we have to encourage if we are to get more
                women back into the workplace.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Shannon:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is disappointing that we have had three
                major motions crammed into one day. That does not do justice to
                any of the issues. Each of them could have done with a full day’s
                debate. Many more Members would have been able to contribute.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The councils, including Ards Borough Council,
                made a significant contribution to ‘Strategy 2010’. It is
                important that Members reiterate some of the points that were
                made through that. Ards Borough Council represents some 80,000
                people living in the borough, mainly around Newtownards.
                However, there is now a focus and a population growth in the
                Comber and Ballygowan areas, which tend to be dormitory towns
                for the Greater Belfast area. It is clear, even to the untrained
                eye, that that area is going to face some considerable problems
                over the next 10 years with respect to the inadequate provision
                of industrial incentives, despite the suitable location.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is essential for the future success of
                Ards borough that attention be focused on the regeneration of
                industry and the expansion of the hospitality sector, which is
                pitifully low in the borough. We heard this morning about the
                problems facing the hospitality sector because of the
                foot-and-mouth outbreak. That is a problem in my area.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Problems that may arise in the future will be
                linked to the increase in population predicted in ‘Shaping our
                Future’. The Ards borough will have some 7,500 new houses in
                the next 13 years, translating into 21,000 people and 14,000
                extra jobs for the borough.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the areas in special need is Comber.
                It is one of the more popular parts of the borough for housing,
                but it has little or nothing to offer any individual or company
                wishing to direct inward investment to the area. There must be
                extra zoning of industrial land in that area.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Local government should have a direct
                influence on planning procedures. Local government is
                accountable and has a grasp of all influencing issues. It has
                been suggested that a fairly small number of industrial units,
                through which we could monitor the needs and requirements of the
                growing population and how industry should grow, could be
                created in association with Government agencies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The role of local government in the
                development of its own jurisdiction needs some clarification. At
                present, the organisation of local government into 26 separate
                entities has led to a diffuse and complex list of priorities and
                goals. Clarity is needed in this area if inward investment is to
                be effectively attracted to all the areas of Northern Ireland,
                and not just to Ards borough. Local government authorities are
                in the best position to understand the needs of their own areas,
                and as a local form of authority they are best placed to provide
                all relevant information to those in the area who wish to create
                or develop business opportunities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is all well and good to have the relevant
                information at your disposal, but if it cannot be distributed
                effectively it might as well not be there. Local people must be
                able to access business development information and assistance
                without difficulty or hindrance. Local government is in a
                position to fulfil that task in a manner that is accountable to
                the ratepayer.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the targets in ‘Strategy 2010’ is
                to reduce unemployment from 4% to 2%. Is that achievable? Local
                government has a strong role to play in that and can help to
                achieve that goal.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Cross-border co-operation has always been
                surrounded by controversy and political expediency and must be
                approached on a practical basis. The thrust of the Belfast
                Agreement is to harmonise infrastructure and policy north and
                south of the border, but any co-operation with southern
                companies should not rise above the importance of co-operation
                with a company from the mainland United Kingdom. Above all, any
                relationship must be based firmly on respect for the integrity
                of Northern Ireland’s constitutional position in the United
                Kingdom and the authority of the Crown here.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When this is established we can have a
                working relationship with companies from the Republic of Ireland
                in areas such as fisheries, forestry, energy and technology. In
                this vein, I agree that assistance is required to optimise
                co-operation between companies north and south of the border.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to internal co-operation, I
                suggest that projects backed by local government authorities
                should not be adopted willy-nilly. The health and wealth of the
                respective boroughs should be the overwhelming priority when it
                comes to business development. There are cases where such
                arrangements will be of mutual benefit to those participating.
                However, we should not enter into such arrangements blindly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is essential, from an international
                aspect, that Ards borough be identified with the Greater Belfast
                area as opposed to the Down area since international companies
                will immediately recognise Belfast as a place for locating
                business. My Colleague Jim Wells will not be happy with that,
                but we have to look at what is best for our own areas. We also
                have to put it on record. On the other hand, co-operation with
                local government authorities on tourist projects may be of
                benefit. Down District Council, Newry and Mourne District
                Council, Ards Borough Council and North Down Borough Council are
                all involved in tourist projects on the coast of Down.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ards Borough Council has suffered greatly as
                a result of the decline in the British textile industry. It is
                important to identify industry which could be attracted into the
                area. Such industries include technology and marketing. Some
                work has been carried out to create a market for high quality
                linens and textiles, which are outside the previous market, but
                these have been undermined by cheap eastern imports. The quality
                sector of the market is, therefore, free for development and
                expansion. However, Northern&nbsp;Ireland is establishing itself
                in foreign markets as a leader in this field. Efforts must also
                be made to increase IT awareness among the local workforce. The
                IT sector is expanding rapidly beyond the rate at which
                individuals are being trained. Everyone must play a role in
                that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In conclusion, the way forward for industrial
                development is for local government authorities to take existing
                small businesses and market their products overseas, whether on
                the United Kingdom mainland or in the United States, through
                targeted trade missions as opposed to inward investment drives.
                Government agencies, as currently structured, can cope with this
                and develop inward investment separately. Together we can make
                this work.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When I was being considered for a position on
                the Enterprise, Trade and Investment Committee I thought that it
                sounded interesting. I thought that we would have the odd wander
                around factories and look at industrial investment. It did not
                sound too difficult. After eight months on the Committee I asked
                why every other Committee seems like a Sunday afternoon stroll
                when the Enterprise, Trade and Investment Committee’s work
                seems like an assault course. It is the busiest Committee in the
                Assembly and has the hardest working staff.</p>

                Committee?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Wells:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I can assure Mr McFarland that the
                Enterprise, Trade and Investment Committee does a lot more work
                than the Regional Development Committee, and I speak as someone
                who has experience of both. We need to pay tribute to the
                extremely hard working Committee staff who have produced this
                huge document. We have gathered information from the widest
                possible range of interest groups. While the other Committees
                were lounging on some beach during the summer recess or having a
                glass of wine in some Greek restaurant, the Enterprise, Trade
                and Investment Committee was working hard gathering evidence. It
                also went on a fact-finding mission to the United States.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a lot to commend in this report. We
                are in a period of enormous transition in Northern&nbsp;Ireland.
                In the Senate Chamber above the Public Gallery are three
                paintings on the ceiling depicting the three cornerstones of
                Northern Ireland’s industrial heritage. One is shipbuilding,
                the second is agriculture, and the third is textiles. The sad
                reality is that the one thing the three industries have in
                common is that they are declining fast. Employment opportunities
                are drying up very quickly in those three pillars of society.
                How we manage the change from the decline of those three pillars
                to the new vibrant global economy in which we find ourselves
                will decide whether Northern&nbsp;Ireland goes forward as a
                heartland of industrial expansion or stagnates.</p>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is much to commend in the report,
                particularly the way in which it deals with the major
                impediments that face us as we go forward. As someone who
                represents a constituency very close to the border, I strongly
                support the recommendation that we examine in detail the
                problems we face in having a land border with the Irish
                Republic. The fact that Northern Ireland is outside the euro
                zone while the Irish Republic is inside is a problem, and we
                know that we have lost opportunities for inward investment
                because of that. The decision on whether we do or do not join
                the Euro is not — thank goodness — one that this Assembly
                will ever have to take. That is a much bigger issue than even
                Sir Reg Empey could cope with. It is just as well that we do not
                have to deal with that, but we have to accept that not being in
                the euro zone causes difficult trading conditions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The dreadful problem of the unequal excise
                duties on fuel has decimated employment in the fuel industry
                within 20-30 miles of the border. I understand that there has
                been a decline of 50% in the amount of diesel sold in Northern
                Ireland, while there has been an increase of 20% in the number
                of diesel cars. Something there does not add up, and it has had
                an enormous effect on garage businesses in the border area.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The big threat on the horizon is the
                aggregates tax. It is not that the tax is being implemented at a
                differential rate in the Republic; it is not being implemented
                there at all. I spoke to quarry owners last weekend, and many of
                them are seeking out quarries in the Irish Republic so that they
                can transfer staff and investment from Northern Ireland into
                such counties as Cavan, Leitrim, Westmeath and, to a lesser
                extent, Donegal. Jobs will migrate, simply because of the
                imposition of a tax that will have a disproportionate impact on
                Northern Ireland in comparison with the rest of the United
                Kingdom.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I take Mr Shannon’s point entirely.
                Clearly, none of this should call into question the
                constitutional status of Northern Ireland, but on the basis of
                two sovereign Governments sitting down and discussing this
                issue, we must find some way of reducing the impact of these
                impediments to our economic growth.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also strongly support the proposal for a
                review of the Barnett formula. This is one of those issues that
                need to be handled very carefully. At the moment, many believe
                that the Barnett formula should be assessed on the basis of
                need, rather than being a pure mathematical formula based on
                population. On the basis of need, Northern Ireland would get a
                higher proportion of the UK cake.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An issue that came up quite late in the
                inquiry — and I am glad that Mr Neeson quite properly raised
                it — was the role of the banks in the Northern Ireland
                economy. Many of us attended an event in the Long Gallery,
                sponsored by Dr McDonnell, at which the results of a survey were
                revealed. They indicated that the greatest single impediment to
                the expansion of local industry in Northern Ireland was the
                attitude of our banks.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The cartel of four large banks overcharges,
                places almost impossible conditions on loans, charges ridiculous
                rates of interest and tries to hide unfair charges in
                complicated statements. Eighty-five per cent of the businesses
                questioned suggested that they were the main impediment. Until
                we get the banks on board in the process, there will always be
                difficulties for the expansion of small industry in Northern
                Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not know what whip this Assembly or the
                Executive can crack with the banks, but there must be something
                wrong with institutions that take over £250 million per year
                out of the Northern Ireland economy and that seem almost to have
                a monopoly on small business loans. That simply cannot be
                allowed to continue. For example, £90 million a year from one
                bank goes straight out of the Northern Ireland economy to
                Australia. The Australians do not need it, and the Northern
                Ireland economy does. We must look at that. We are not talking
                about nationalisation, but we must bring these bodies under
                control. They have had it too good for too long.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My party and I strongly welcome the proposal
                to amalgamate all the industrial promotion bodies into one new
                unit. That is one of the most far-sighted proposals made by the
                Committee, and we support it. We also support the concept of its
                being taken outwith the Civil Service and given the flexibility
                and power to go out and attract industry and to employ the very
                best executives to seek new investment in Northern Ireland. That
                is an extremely welcome development that cannot come soon
                enough.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the downside, however, the one issue that
                will handicap Northern Ireland’s future growth, apart from the
                difficulties of having the common land border and not being part
                of the euro, is the tremendous problem facing our
                infrastructure. We have the very difficult problem to crack of
                25 to 30 years of underinvestment in our roads, ports and rail.
                Mr Campbell is looking at this matter, and I wish him well. When
                he was in the United States recently he looked at possible
                options for private sector investment without the loss of public
                control in infrastructure. If we can crack that problem, then we
                get round the other great bottleneck that is affecting our
                future expansion. If we cannot transport goods and services
                round and in and out of the Province quickly, we will always be
                lagging behind when it comes to future growth.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support recommendations 10 and 11, which
                suggest that not only should we have a vibrant economy but also
                an environmentally aware and green economy. I do not see these
                aspects as being mutually exclusive. Ms Morrice spoke at length
                on this issue in the Committee. I see the revolution in the
                attitude to green issues as an opportunity for Northern Ireland
                rather than a threat. We have a problem with our shipbuilding
                industry, but perhaps instead of making ships we should make
                wind turbines. Northern Ireland should take the lead on these
                issues and show that it is possible to combine the protection of
                the environment with a vibrant economy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are some exciting opportunities as well
                as some concerns, and I commend the report to the Assembly.
                However, I agree with Mr Shannon that it is appalling that three
                absolutely vital issues affecting this Province were discussed
                and debated on the same day. This is the most important report
                to have come from any of the Committees so far, and an entire
                day should have been set aside for the debate. To have the
                debate on the same day as a debate on consequential loss for the
                rural community because of the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak,
                together with a debate on foot-and-mouth disease itself, is not
                acceptable.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The full impact of this report should be on
                the front page of almost every newspaper in the Province, but
                that opportunity has been lost because of the foot-and-mouth
                disease debate. We have to manage our business better to ensure
                that this does not happen in the future.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ford:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members will be pleased to hear that I do not
                intend to take up in full my allocated ten minutes.
                Unfortunately I have not heard much of the debate because I was
                at a meeting, but I have endeavoured to follow on television
                some of what has been said.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given my past experience as a social worker,
                I welcome the fact that the Enterprise, Trade and Investment
                Committee, which might have been thought to have been solely
                concerned with the &quot;hard economy&quot;, has made some firm
                and straightforward recommendations under the section which it
                headlines ‘Partnership and Cohesion’. There are major
                problems for the economy because of the failure to address the
                issues of poverty and long-term unemployment. We are not going
                to develop the economy of Northern Ireland in the way we need to
                if those who are educated do well and those at the bottom of the
                educational heap continue in short-term unskilled jobs and fail
                to contribute to the economy in the way in which they and their
                families need to in terms of the income payable. The Committee
                has made a significant contribution in that area, and that is to
                be welcomed. Frequently in the past that has been left out when
                looking at the field of economic development. Similarly the
                remarks on social cohesion, and the social economy and the role
                it can play, need to be followed through.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I should have known, having to follow Jim
                Wells, that the second of my hobby horses — environmental
                aspects of the economy — would have been well covered. So
                perhaps I should not make too much of that. The clean, green
                image that we have on this island compared to much of Europe is
                a major strength for potential economic development. It also
                presents a major threat if we do not continue to keep that image
                right, but it is a major opportunity for growth in the relevant
                areas of the economy, many of which Mr Wells covered.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to look at part of the issue raised by
                Sean Neeson, and that is the way in which the public sector
                relates to the private sector and the way in which the public
                sector manages to control, guide or exercise discretion over the
                direction of the economy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the inclusion in the report of the
                slightly coy and guarded agreement that the need for tax varying
                powers has to be seriously addressed. We do not have the luxury
                of the Scots, who have tax varying powers in law but are
                frightened to use them. This is something that we will have to
                look into in the future. The report clearly lays down guidelines
                for carrying out a study, and we could build on that. It is the
                responsibility of everyone in the Chamber to look at the best
                economic future for Northern Ireland and only by using all the
                economic levers that we can to get the economy growing, people
                employed and businesses thriving will we begin to invest in
                infrastructure, develop private industry and start to repair the
                damage of the past.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">‘Strategy 2010’ is an important document
                in that respect, and the Committee report must be welcomed. We
                should be working for economic success. It is perhaps
                regrettable that the Committee hedged round how tax varying
                powers might be handled in points 15, 16 and 17. At least it has
                recognised the term &quot;fiscal flexibility&quot;, and I
                welcome the fact that that term appears.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is not only dangerous radicals like me who
                think that fiscal flexibility is important. Bodies such as the
                Institute of Directors have joined the call for such powers as
                well. It is logical and makes common sense. A mature Government,
                even a devolved regional legislature, must have the power to
                control their own purse, or they will not have the powers they
                need. This is not just about how to spend the money — which we
                spent time discussing when we looked at budgets — it is also
                about where the money comes from and how we raise it. In that
                sense tax varying powers are integral to any economic planning.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Look at some of the debates we have had. We
                discussed fuel tax and looked at the problem of the different
                tax rates across the border. We had a recent debate on the
                aggregates tax. Mr Wells has left, so he cannot exercise his
                environmentalist concern over the way in which the aggregates
                tax may or may not be applied. However, if it is applied as
                currently proposed by the UK Government, there is no doubt that
                there will be a migration of jobs to quarries in the Republic.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We all recognise that we need to determine
                policy and drive it forward — not just taking the income as
                given. We could look at taxation in a number of other areas as
                well. Part of the reason for the economic growth in the Republic
                is that it has a lower rate of corporation tax than we do. That
                creates difficulties for this corner of the island that the
                &quot;Celtic tiger&quot; economy does not have.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the recognition of all that is
                inadequate with the Barnett formula. There must be change. As
                the report acknowledges, Barnett was thought to be a short- term
                solution in the 1970s. It is something that we are stuck with, a
                blunt instrument that has completely failed to address the
                levels of real need in the three &quot;Celtic fringe&quot;
                nations as opposed to England.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Last week the redistribution of Government
                resources within the regions of England was raised. That issue
                is not going to go away. However, the Assembly should be careful
                to say that the revision of Barnett is not just a threat —
                although there is a degree of threat — it is also an
                opportunity. We can make a case for a needs-based assessment
                rather than a simple headcount-based assessment. Whatever needs
                to be adjusted between English regions, like the south-west and
                the north-east on the one hand and Greater London and the
                south-east on the other, there is a continuing need for this
                region to receive a fair allocation from the UK Exchequer. That
                requires a modification to Barnett and amendments to our tax
                varying powers, whenever we get them.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When we discussed the regional rate, my party
                was accused of wanting the money but not wanting to raise it
                because we opposed the increase. The increase was gradually
                whittled down due to the pressure that the Minister of Finance
                and Personnel was under. Every time he looked in his back
                pocket, the Civil Service allowed him to find a few more million
                pounds.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The regional rate, however it is used for
                raising taxes, is about the most blunt and unfair possible
                taxation. We need to look for a better system of taxation based,
                almost certainly, on income tax but with variations on
                corporation tax. There is also potential for other tax-varying
                powers, which we must have.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is the first report from any Assembly
                Committee that has recognised that Barnett is a matter for all
                Members, not just the Minister of Finance and Personnel, and has
                agreed the need for tax-varying powers. I welcome and endorse
                the Committee’s report on ‘Strategy 2010’.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and
                Investment (Sir Reg Empey):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the report and thank the Committee,
                the strategy steering group (SSG) and the Economic Development
                Forum (EDF) for their contributions. I feared that Mr Wells was
                going to eulogise and even propose the beatification of some of
                the Committee members who were obviously working so hard.
                However, I also acknowledge the work that they put in.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They worked over the summer, which my
                Department hopes they will do again this summer. There are plans
                in the pipeline to keep them occupied. We hope that the result
                of this significant amount of activity will be positive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Adam Ingram, as Minister responsible for the
                Department of Economic Development, initiated the process. In
                the foreword to ‘Strategy 2010’ he emphasised that it had
                been produced as a basis for discussion. It was also envisaged
                that leadership for that debate would come from the Assembly and
                that there would be extensive involvement from the wider
                community. I highlight those points because the Chairperson’s
                opening remarks focused on the consultation issue, which has
                also been mentioned by others.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have made it clear that I have never,
                either now or in the past, viewed ‘Strategy 2010’ as a
                definitive or fixed blueprint to be slavishly followed. Rather,
                it was an agenda for change created over two years ago in a
                unique partnership that would extend through a consultative
                process to the implementation of accepted recommendations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It will be recalled that delays in getting
                devolution had an impact on the speed at, and the degree to,
                which recommendations were implemented. Adam Ingram indicated in
                the foreword of the document that the Assembly would have to
                deliberate on it and, ultimately, decide its fate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">By initiating this debate the Committee has
                obviously led the further stage of the process, which was added
                to by the 58 written evidence and 45 oral evidence sessions —
                a substantial amount of work. The SSG, the 11 sectoral and seven
                cross-sectoral teams and the ‘Strategy 2010’ consultation
                panel deserve thanks for their efforts to produce the strategy
                in the first place.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members will recall that a huge number of
                people, much larger than in the past, were involved in this
                exercise. It would not have taken place in this fashion had it
                not been for the arrival of devolution. Never before under
                direct rule was such a substantial amount of consultation
                undertaken, and, although the Committee has pointed out
                weaknesses with that process, we must nevertheless thank those
                who gave voluntarily of their time to enable it to occur.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thanks are due to the EDF which was
                established as one of the recommendations in the ‘Strategy
                2010’ report. It has given generously of its time over the
                past 18 months to provide advice on many of the other
                recommendations and related key issues. It should be noted that,
                during the Committee’s inquiry, our new structures have been
                working increasingly effectively and the Programme for
                Government has been developed and approved.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Programme for Government states the
                Executive’s priorities across all areas of expenditure,
                including economic development. It is important to remember that
                the programme is not set in stone but is designed to be reviewed
                on an annual basis. This provides the opportunity for many of
                the recommendations that are foreshadowed in the report to find
                their way through into the programme because that is the only
                way, ultimately, in which they will be implemented.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The task now is to ensure that agreed
                priorities and measures are reflected in the Programme for
                Government as it is rolled out over the years. I repeat that
                this will be on an annual basis because things change
                continually. It is not possible to determine what should happen
                and then sit and wait for it to happen in the economy. The
                Chairperson of the Enterprise, Trade and Investment Committee
                also focused on the lack of economic modelling, and I know that
                that has been a criticism from some professional economists.
                However, the ‘Strategy 2010’ report did understand those
                matters, and there was a number of contributions from the
                Northern Ireland Economic Counsel (NIEC), which has done reports
                in the past, and from the Northern Ireland Economic Research
                Centre (NIERC) itself, which exists to carry out research. The
                ‘Strategy 2010’ Committees were not without an awareness of
                such matters.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Globalisation has also been mentioned today,
                and, of course, that was in the context of today’s being May
                Day. The Chairperson also spoke about the Republic, and how well
                it has been doing. There is no economy that has benefited more
                from globalisation than the Republic because it was that process
                that brought the benefits, and that needs to be spelled out.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several Members, including the Chairperson,
                referred to the question of equality. Equality and social
                cohesion was one of the ‘Strategy 2010’ report’s key
                themes. Page 14 of the report states that</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Everyone in Northern Ireland must have
                a stake in economic success. The benefits must be fairly shared
                and we need real partnership in our drive for common goals and
                social cohesion.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Equality and social cohesion, therefore, are
                incorporated into the ‘Strategy 2010’ report. The Programme
                for Government has picked this theme up and it states that</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Our vision — as set out in the
                agreement — is of a peaceful, inclusive, prosperous, stable
                and fair society&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It goes on to say that this vision is and
                must be</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;based on ‘partnership, equality and
                mutual respect&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">New TSN is also a new policy of the
                Executive, and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and
                Investment policies give priority to New TSN areas. I noticed
                that Mr Carrick raised the issue of the borough of Craigavon and
                said that he did not want his area to be disadvantaged by New
                TSN policies. There is an element of unnecessary alarm about the
                issue. There is nothing wrong in saying to people, who might
                wish to invest, that there are certain areas of our territory
                where we wish to see industry strengthened because there are
                weaknesses. We cannot instruct and we do not attempt to prevent
                people going to another location if that is what they want to
                do. However, we do encourage them and that can be done
                financially, as well as in other ways. If an employer decides
                that he wants to invest in a particular area, there would be no
                question of our taking any action to prevent that. However, the
                Department is saying that there are clearly identified areas in
                our Province that have specific and special needs, and it is
                only proper that we give credence to that policy. The Department
                is fully committed to that; it has targets in the Programme for
                Government, and I am happy to say that, at the moment, it is
                achieving those targets.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that Mr Carrick will not be alarmed. I
                have been to his borough on a number of occasions, and I have
                spoken to the representatives of the district council; I have
                visited the area extensively, and I can assure him that no
                discrimination is taking place against the borough as a result
                of New TSN policies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A number of Members referred to partnership
                and shared ownership, and the Chairperson mentioned the Fast
                Track to employment IT schemes in the Republic. Obviously that
                is a matter that my colleague, Dr Farren, will want to address
                together with a number of the recommendations in the report.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Enterprise, Trade and
                Investment has identified that the Committee’s recommendations
                are spread over eight of the 10 Departments, and seven
                Departments have recommendations pertaining to them.
                Consequently, my Department has written to the other Departments
                seeking their views and advice on those recommendations.
                Therefore I am not in a position to come to a definitive view on
                the report today. I communicated that to the Chairperson and
                Deputy Chairperson in advance of today’s debate, because I do
                not want it to be seen as any discourtesy to the Committee.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Think of the practicalities. The Committee
                has taken months to prepare this substantial report — the
                Department has only had it for a few weeks. Many of the
                recommendations involve other Departments; we have not yet had
                their input, and it is not possible to have definitive views on
                such a wide range of recommendations yet. Furthermore, I have
                been asked to respond in writing by early June, when it would be
                my intention to give a more definitive response.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not believe that the Committee expects
                me to treat such a substantial report with a cursory view, so I
                am not in a position to say that I can, and will, implement
                every one of the recommendations. I can say that each is being
                pursued actively and will be responded to, by me in writing, in
                early June provided that I am given the proper responses by the
                other Departments that I have contacted. I have no doubt that
                that will be the case.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A number of Members, including the Deputy
                Chairperson, referred to the Barnett formula and the fiscal
                environment; indeed Mr Ford talked about the matter at some
                length. I have written to the Financial Secretary many times
                about items such as aggregates tax and fuel duty. I have been to
                see the Financial Secretary and I know that my Colleague, Mark
                Durkan, has prepared a comprehensive list of tax issues. The
                First Minister and the Deputy First Minister saw the Chancellor
                earlier this year. I receive regular and frequent correspondence
                on those two issues, and I know, and agree, that anybody who is
                seriously taking a land border into account would not have come
                up with the aggregates tax as currently drafted. It amounts to a
                tax in excess of 60% on quarry products here compared with 25%
                on quarry products in Great Britain.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Anybody with an ounce of wit could see that a
                lorry load of stones can be driven a few miles along the road
                and would replace the production needs of a particular area. I
                share the environmental objective that the people who designed
                this tax may have; and a number of Members, including Mrs
                Carson, have referred to environmental issues. However, if the
                product can be replaced a few miles down the road, the tax is
                not capable of achieving its objective, and there is no point in
                having it. Quarrying will not become a revenue raising activity,
                because the revenue, like fuel duty, is being substituted.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">6.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Statistics show that, in the last five or six
                years, the amount of legally-imported fuel into Northern Ireland
                has halved. However, we all know that there has been a
                substantial increase in the number of vehicles on the road. It
                is perfectly clear that fuel duty is being lost to the
                Chancellor. We have pointed this out on a number of occasions. I
                have received delegations from a wide range of Assembly Members
                who are all saying the same thing. Mr Durkan, the First Minister
                and the Deputy First Minister regularly correspond with the
                Treasury on one or other of those issues — and sometimes on
                all of them. The Executive are very focused on this issue, and
                we are trying to do our best.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have to deal with the issue of the Barnett
                formula and related matters very cautiously. We are opening up a
                Pandora’s box, so we need to be very careful. We have
                benefited significantly from substantial public expenditure over
                the years. We are fortunate that throughout the first three
                years of devolution we have benefited, and will continue to
                benefit, from a background of real increases in public
                expenditure — not simply cash increases, but increases in real
                terms, after adjustment for inflation. That is a background that
                we did not think we would have. I know that Mark Durkan, the
                First Minister and the Deputy First Minister are looking very
                closely at that issue and that research is being carried out.
                The alternative to the Barnett formula is a needs-based formula
                in which you have to prove the needs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have little doubt that we can all think of
                examples, such as in health or education, where our need is
                greater. There may be other areas where we do better than other
                UK regions. However, do not assume that we will have a smooth
                passage from the Treasury. I can assure you that that will not
                be the case. Some Members have referred to the single
                development agency — Mr Neeson was one of them. We are making
                progress on that. It is a very complicated exercise, but its
                time has come. The agencies were developed over 30 years; things
                have now moved on, and it is only right and proper that at this
                stage we implement our decision to create a new agency. I hope
                that that work will result in legislation being brought to the
                House at some stage in the latter part of next month, but
                clearly it will have to carry over into the autumn before its
                passage is completed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McClarty focused very strongly on tourism
                — an industry that has been growing steadily. As has been
                indicated by a number of Members, it has huge potential. It
                could very well be our second fastest growing industry, if not
                our fastest. There is great potential in Northern Ireland for
                tourism, and it is very sad that we have been crippled so far
                this year by the unfortunate circumstances of the foot-and-mouth
                outbreak.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr McDonnell made the point that the ‘Strategy
                2010’ document was valuable and was a major milestone. That is
                probably true — it was the first document of its type under
                direct rule. It involved a wide range of people. However, as Dr
                McDonnell rightly pointed out, it is the quality of the
                intervention, rather that the quantity, that is important. That
                is a lesson that we have learnt.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Birnie referred to the grant mentality
                that we used to have. Indeed, we are at the top of a European
                League table. If one examines the amount of money that is given
                by agencies now and analyses what it is given for, one can see
                that LEDU has almost done away with capital grants. Technically
                it still has got the power to give them, but very rarely does
                so.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have closely examined the major investment
                decisions on projects costing over £1 million, which require my
                approval, and very few of these involve capital expenditure.
                Such expenditure is rarely a significant part of any package.
                Far more emphasis, from LEDU’s point of view, is placed on
                what is described as &quot;soft assistance&quot;, but I think
                that is the wrong term. The assistance is often based on advice
                and marketing, but in many agencies it is focused on individuals
                by means of employment grants, assistance with premises and
                other matters. Capital grant aid is not the significant force
                that it once was. The Department is working towards rebalancing
                this package as part of a long-term process.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is great to stand up here and to debate
                this issue, but we all know that if problems hit an area or a
                company in a Member’s own constituency, the economic theory is
                thrown out of the window, and it is more a case of Members
                saying &quot;We have got to bail this boy out&quot;. We are all
                politicians, and we have to admit that these things happen. If
                it happens in our own back yard, we will go out to save the
                operation as best we can.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is easy to uphold the theory, and Members
                might reject the concept of capital grants by saying &quot;We
                are not going to subsidise inefficiency, we are just going to
                let that company close&quot;. However, when such a closure
                actually takes place, few people will come out of the trenches.
                When companies get into difficulties, I receive phone calls and
                letters. Members also ask me &quot;Can I bring so-and-so to see
                you?&quot; We are all the same; I am no different. The theory is
                fine, but its implementation is another matter. Nobody wants to
                see enterprises failing or closing, but we must develop the
                strong trend away from the grant mentality, towards different
                forms of finance.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree entirely with Mr Neeson’s
                suggestion that we examine the procedures of America’s small
                business administration. It is a totally different system, but
                it seems to have been very successful, therefore there might be
                some potential in that. However, while the Treasury continues to
                treat guarantees as money spent in total, we will have serious
                problems, and I think that the Member knows that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have already mentioned Mr Carrick’s
                point. Ms Morrice said that this is a gigantic task, and I fully
                acknowledge that. She also stated that wealth should not be
                measured in terms of GNP alone, but on the basis of quality of
                life. That is a very good point, and Northern Ireland could do
                very well in this regard, because it is possible to enjoy a very
                good quality of life here, provided that one is given peace to
                get on with it. One of the things that we like to tell visitors
                is that we have a very high quality of life in Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Birnie also referred to the consultation
                with professional economists, and he made a rather colourful
                analogy drawn from naval architecture. One can think of others,
                but &quot;re-engineering&quot; ‘Strategy 2010’, as he
                referred to it, is probably an appropriate phrase because it was
                never intended to be set in concrete. I have never said that I
                accept every recommendation, because I have never done that. I
                have no doubt that we will &quot;re-engineer&quot; this report
                in due course.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGrady referred to the new agency. He
                also — as is often the case from his correspondence —
                referred to tourism in his area. I know that he feels strongly
                about these matters. He mentioned removing the local government
                cap on local economic development expenditure. I do not have a
                problem with that. The vast majority of local authorities do not
                spend to the 5p limit. Some councils have stuck with the 2p
                limit that they have been used to while one or two have raised
                their limit. However, it is a matter for the Minister of the
                Environment and I have made my views known to him.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mark Robinson talked about massive changes
                and said that we must embrace such changes. He referred to a
                number of education issues such as general national vocational
                qualifications (GNVQs) being scorned. I understand his point. It
                is a problem of perceptions, and Sean Farren is very focused on
                that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Robinson also referred to the 8% rise in
                business rates. It is not an 8% rise in business rates — the
                rise is 3·3% after Mr Durkan compared how we are faring with
                GB. People must understand that the Treasury take a very
                jaundiced view of our policy on rates for properties and
                businesses. It consistently argues that in many cases our rates
                are not more than 40% of what people in GB would be paying. It
                argues that there is a significant financial gap. I am pleased
                that it has been possible to retain the increase to 3·3% for
                businesses, and that will include businesses in the Member’s
                constituency.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Carson, and a number of Members, referred
                to the section of the report dealing with the clean, green
                economy. She also referred to biomass and other products in her
                area. There is potential for all of these, and if we can get the
                technology right, it is an area that agriculture could move
                into, particular after the recent trauma that there has been in
                that sector.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Courtney referred to tax exemption for
                creative industries. There has been a very strong group formed
                on creative industries. We are pushing them very hard because we
                see big advantages there. It is an issue that the Chancellor is
                going to have to address. I would be happy to add that topic to
                the list of tax issues that Mr Durkan is looking at. I would ask
                my officials to remind me to write to him about that. It could
                be a way of giving people a chance to get started. There may be
                some measures that have been introduced, but perhaps they could
                be more adventurous.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Shannon referred to the role of local
                government. He is speaking to the converted because I spent a
                long time in local government. I agree with him that there are
                many things that local authorities can do. When the reform of
                local government takes place — and I made this clear to the
                forum that we held in Antrim a couple of weeks ago for all local
                authorities — I want to see them having a more defined role.
                The problem at the moment is that some local authorities are so
                small that they do not have enough of a financial base to give
                them the opportunity to provide adequate services.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I referred to Mr Wells and the assault course
                that he has embarked on. He seems to be thriving on it. He is
                obviously anxious for more, and, undoubtedly, our Department
                will have picked that up and will be very happy to provide him
                with more activity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We now have one of the positive products of
                devolution. It takes time to change policy; it is like an oil
                tanker — it takes time to turn around. We are moving to a
                stage where mature discussions and debates can take place.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While it is for the Business Committee to
                organise debates, much activity has been crammed into one day
                — all of it on issues that we feel strongly about. I hope that
                the Assembly authorities can take this point on board. By this
                time a number of Members may be beginning to run out of steam.
                This is an issue that we should be spending more time debating.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Chairman, the Deputy Chairman and
                the members of the Committee. My Department is taking the report
                very seriously; all our senior officials are in the Chamber to
                hear the debate. We will be responding comprehensively when we
                get the reports from the other Departments. I acknowledge the
                report, but at this stage I am unable to do justice to all the
                recommendations by giving responses off the top of my head.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">6.30 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will respond to the Committee in detail,
                recommendation by recommendation, early next month. When we get
                through that process and have agreement between the Committee
                and the Department, we may find that it is necessary to amend
                the policies in the Programme for Government. If so, we can go
                forward jointly with the amendments when the review of that
                process comes up at the end of this year.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Doherty:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, LeasCheann Comhairle. I
                thank the Minister and all the Members who participated in the
                debate. I am greatly encouraged by the support of the Minister,
                and I understand the parameters within which he has to work.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is agreement that urgent measures need
                to be undertaken to develop sound economic policies that will
                ultimately provide a better standard of living for us all. I
                will respond briefly to some of the comments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sean Neeson made a very telling comment that
                was reflected in the Minister’s speech — ‘Strategy 2010’
                is not written in tablets of stone. It is a developing document.
                Mr Neeson focused on fiscal policy and, cautiously, on the
                Barnett formula. He also focused on the need to support small
                businesses to such an extent that they become the backbone of
                our economy. I support him.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">David McClarty spoke of the importance of
                tourism, saying that it could develop to such an extent that it
                would become the second most important industry in Ireland. I
                recognise that. He talked about the need to market the island of
                Ireland as a whole so that we can all move forward and focus in
                on this industry. He said that events tourism is the way
                forward, giving the North West 200 as an example.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Alasdair McDonnell focused — as he did in
                Committee — on globalisation. Globalisation is the name of the
                game and has been for the last 10 years. We need to accept that,
                along with all its problems. He also said that the single
                development agency needed to have teeth and real talent in order
                to produce inward investment. He said that we must penetrate new
                technology to create new, better-paid jobs, and he made that
                point continuously throughout our deliberations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mervyn Carrick said that it was two years
                since ‘Strategy 2010’ was first produced and that it had
                moved on. He also said that we needed to focus on education and
                training and to gear them to the skills required in industry.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Jane Morrice said that economic and social
                development must always go hand in hand. She said that we needed
                to move out of the mentality of the fear of failure, as that was
                crippling us, and that we should learn from the way that the
                Americans took risks and developed. She also focused on the
                needs and demands of women in the workplace, the single European
                currency that we can no longer ignore and the value of the
                social economy, which is something that we are all recognising.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Esmond Birnie said that the economy urgently
                needed entrepreneurs and managers. I was aware of all of his
                comments and have taken note of his three areas of concern. We
                had a separate dialogue — in fact, it was probably the first
                dialogue between Committee Chairpersons. We were both aware
                that, in many ways, our report touched on areas of concern to
                his Committee. Very early on in our final submissions we agreed
                to extract all the facets of our report that were of relevance
                to his report. It was a good exercise for us, and I appreciate
                very much his comments on the report.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Eddie McGrady spoke about the need to focus
                on regional disparities in relation to the long-term unemployed.
                We did that quite thoroughly, but he focused on one aspect of
                the IT skills. He also mentioned that tourism needed to be
                driven, financed and given specific targets, which was a very
                good comment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mark Robinson said that we needed to market
                ourselves as a first-class destination for inward investment,
                and that the GNVQ should be valued as a qualification. Those are
                very good recommendations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Joan Carson talked about the lower
                corporation tax in the South and how that was having an effect
                on us. She also said that we, as an Assembly, now had an
                opportunity to address our problems rather than to depend on
                other people to do so.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Annie Courtney, another Committee Colleague,
                talked of the stronger links required between further education
                and industry and the need for tax exemptions for creative
                industries. Again, she focused on women in the work place.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Jim Shannon spoke on the need for extra
                zoning of industrial land. He also said that the role of local
                government needed clarification and that local government should
                have a role in reducing unemployment. These were well made
                points, and they are recognised.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Committee Colleague Jim Wells highlighted at
                the start of his contribution the fact that the three big
                industries of shipbuilding, textiles and agriculture were all in
                decline and that we needed to recognise that and focus on the
                new emerging IT and related industries to replace them. He
                highlighted the aggregates tax as a big problem and the fact
                that we have a land border with the South. With your permission,
                a Cheann Comhairle, I was almost going to say that I had a
                solution for him on that, but I will not develop it today given
                the time factors. He mentioned the way in which the banks take
                profit out of the state — that is well recognised, and we
                should support his position on that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">David Ford spoke of the major problems for
                the economy arising from poverty-related issues and long-term
                unemployment. He spoke very clearly on the need to tackle the
                issue of tax-varying powers. The Barnett formula was again
                mentioned. Even though there are problems — which the Minister
                highlighted — it is not simply an open chequebook that we will
                be seeking in renegotiating that. He also said that the regional
                rates are a fairly blunt and unfair way of raising tax.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In a conversation I had with the Minister
                some time ago, he reiterated the point that we, in a sense, had
                inherited ‘Strategy 2010’ from Adam Ingram and his
                committee. That is where the origins of the document lie. For
                him, and I suppose for us, it is an agenda for change. At one
                stage, perhaps not today, he said that the original document —
                and our criticism and evaluation of it — is actually a living
                document that is constantly developing. I think that that is
                true — we could be back here in a year’s time developing it
                further. It is in that context that I take all his other points.
                He noted the benefits of globalisation and reiterated the
                commitments to New TSN.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I understand entirely that the Minister
                cannot give a definitive commitment today to the document
                because it covers eight other Departments and is a living and
                developing document. I appreciate his commitment to it and the
                praise he gave the work put in so far. He also said that he
                would respond in due course to all of the recommendations, which
                I also appreciate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The aggregates tax, the fuel tax, the Barnett
                formula and the single development agency were also touched on
                essentially to culminate in the improved quality of life we are
                collectively trying to achieve as we move forward with joined-up
                government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I accept that some of the recommendations can
                be introduced relatively easily and quickly. However, others are
                more long term and will involve a substantial cost. We do not
                underestimate the difficulties that lie ahead. It is crucial
                that all the Committees take a full interest in the issues that
                fall within their own Departments’s responsibility. It is also
                crucial that all the Departments involved give a clear
                commitment to deliver those recommendations, which do much to
                highlight the impact that joined-up government can have.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In conclusion, I would like to thank all the
                Committee members, for this was an enormous task that we
                undertook — probably a much bigger task that we realised at
                the outset. Our Committee is made up of, as other Committees
                are, 11 members from six parties. It consists of three members
                of the SDLP, two members of the UUP, two members of Sinn Féin,
                two members of the DUP, one member of the Alliance Party and one
                member of the Women’s Coalition.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The six parties worked together, even through
                the summer recess — something I will not inflict on them again
                this summer, unless the Committee Clerk, Cathie White, decides
                otherwise. I would like to thank every one of the Committee
                members — and also the new members who joined us for the work
                — for the collective way in which the work was approached. It
                is proof that when we focus on an issue we can deal with it and
                leave other issues outside the door. I would also like to thank
                the Committee staff, who did an enormous amount of work — we
                could not have had better staff.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, I would like to thank the Minister
                and his entire Department for the way in which they related to
                us while we were dealing with the report. I thank the Minister
                for the open way that he gave us access to whatever we requested
                and for the openness with which his departmental officials dealt
                with us. That too is a recommendation of the way to move forward
                and on how to make joined-up government work. I commend the
                motion to the Assembly.</p>
