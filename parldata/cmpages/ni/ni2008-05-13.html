		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Members observed two minutes&rsquo; silence.</p>
		    <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="1"></a>Matters Of The Day</p>
		    <p class="H4StageHeading">Spamount Car Bomb</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Mrs Arlene Foster has sought leave to make a statement on a matter  that fulfils the criteria that are set out in Standing Order 23A. As this is  the first occasion on which such a statement has been made, I shall outline the  procedure that will be followed. I shall call Mrs Foster to speak for up to three  minutes on the subject. I shall then call a Member from each of the other  parties, as agreed with Whips. Those Members will also have up to three minutes  to speak on the matter. There will be no opportunity for interventions, for  questions or for a vote on the matter. I shall not take any points of order until  the item of business is concluded. If that is clear, we shall proceed.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  Under Standing Order 23A, &ldquo;Matters of the Day&rdquo;, I wish to make a brief  statement. Last night, a serious incident occurred in the village of Spamount.  A young police officer, who was making his way to his work in Fermanagh to  serve and protect &mdash; the motto of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI)  &mdash; the community in that county, was targeted in a heinous way, when a  booby-trap bomb was placed under his car. This morning, I was told by the  divisional commander that the officer is fortunate to be alive and that he  probably owes his life to quick-thinking members of the public who bravely  pulled him from the burning vehicle.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Words cannot convey my disgust, and that of my party, at  last night&rsquo;s events. I ask Members from every side of the House to join us in  condemning last night&rsquo;s actions; to empathise with the officer and his family;  to commend the people who assisted the officer after the bomb exploded; to call  on those who have information to bring it to the police; and to send a clear  message from this place that the people of Northern Ireland will not tolerate  that sort of despicable behaviour from such societal deviants.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Kelly</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Member for her  statement, to which I add my voice. I planned to speak about the matter later,  during the Final Stage of the Commission for Victims and Survivors Bill. I  endorse the statement that is to be released from the Office of the First and  deputy First Minister and the comments that Pat Doherty, the MP for the area,  made this morning.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, on behalf of my party, I condemn that act in the  strongest possible terms. Bearing in mind the subject of the debate later  today, let there be no more victims. The establishment of a commission for  victims and survivors is an attempt to bring closure for such people, and, in  such circumstances, the last thing we need is more victims.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Although dangerous, the individuals and groups responsible  for such attacks are tiny in number. They have no support in the community or  anywhere in Ireland,  and they are attempting to bring us back to the past. They will fail, and their  threats against the police, politicians and others will fail. Whatever their  aims, the perpetrators are practicing dinosaur politics &mdash; everyone else is  moving forward while they are attempting to move back.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I also wish to praise the people who helped the injured  policeman and, through their prompt actions, possibly saved his life.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I add to Arlene Foster&rsquo;s request by saying that anyone with  information should bring it to the PSNI. Furthermore, I extend our sympathy to  the policeman and his family. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I add my voice in unreservedly condemning &mdash; in the strongest possible terms &mdash;  last night&rsquo;s murderous attack in Spamount, County  Tyrone, on a young PSNI officer who  was making every effort to serve the local community, particularly in County Fermanagh.  It is a great relief that he was rescued from the car, and I pay tribute to  those who gave assistance. I wish the officer a speedy and full recovery, and I  extend good wishes to his family and colleagues.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">By carrying out his duty and serving his community, that  officer is, along with his colleagues, making a positive contribution to  society, which contrasts sharply with the actions of the perpetrators, who have  no place in decent society and want to bring us back to the past.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I join with others in encouraging members of the local  community &mdash; who are equally shocked and distressed about the nature of the  attack &mdash; to come forward and help the PSNI in order that those responsible can  be made amenable to prosecution. The technical nature of the bomb, which is of  a particularly dangerous type, is a worrying departure, and I hope that, with  the local community&rsquo;s assistance, the PSNI will gather enough information to  bring those responsible to book.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I pay tribute to local community representatives &mdash;  especially my colleague councillor Derek Hussey &mdash; who are showing leadership  and ensuring that the community remains stable and calm. The Ulster Unionist  Party believes that communities in Northern Ireland do not support  such actions, and it wishes them never to happen again.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I am grateful to Mrs Foster for the opportunity to speak about this matter. On  behalf of the SDLP, I say that that attack was a cowardly and despicable  attempt to intimidate police officers from carrying out their duties to the  community. It was also an attempt to intimidate the wider public; however,  those efforts will be in vain, and that is demonstrated each time the PSNI run  a recruitment competition, when thousands of young people &mdash; both Catholic and  Protestant &mdash; apply for a dwindling number of posts. Evidently, the community  supports the police.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, I wish to make it absolutely clear that there  was never a mandate from the Catholic, nationalist community for violent  attacks on police officers or any other member of the community. Indeed, it was  heartening to learn that a member of the public came to the officer&rsquo;s  assistance and saved him from further injury, and I join with others in wishing  the officer a speedy recovery.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly&rsquo;s condemnation of the attack sends the message  that the perpetrators of such actions have no place in our society. Unlike  police officers, those people have no support, no agenda and no future. I also  ask anyone who has information about this terrible attack to contact the PSNI  to ensure that justice is served.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  also thank Mrs Foster for raising the matter. On behalf of my party and my  Assembly group, I join those Members who condemned this dreadful act of  attempted murder and intimidation of a police officer. I express my sympathy to  the officer, his family, his friends and his colleagues in the Police Service.  It is also important that we commend the bravery of those civilians who saved  the police officer from an even worse fate. Their actions show how the  community responds to such attacks on the Police Service and how little support  the perpetrators of such actions have. The Chief Constable summed that up  eloquently this morning when he said that such acts achieved nothing except to  inflict pain on the victims.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The best thing that Members can do is to encourage anyone  who can assist the police in any way to do so. We must also concentrate on our  responsibilities to develop the political institutions to provide good  government for all the people of Northern Ireland and to work  actively to promote the type of shared future that will make the perpetrators  of such an attack even less significant.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I thank Members for those sentiments, which, I am sure, are shared  throughout the wider community.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. I acknowledge your ruling, and I have  no trouble accepting it. However, I would be failing in my duty as the  Chairperson of the Committee on Procedures if I did not say that one intention  of the new Standing Order was to give Members of the constituency concerned the  opportunity to comment on matters such as this. I am disappointed that that did  not happen.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Business Committee will, undoubtedly, review that. The main  purpose of using that Standing Order was to allow Members to express their  sympathy to the police officer and to assure him, and all his colleagues, that  they have our total support. The issue that the Member raised can be addressed  when the Speaker returns.</p>
		    <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="2" id="2"></a>Ministerial Statement</p>
		    <p class="H4StageHeading">North/South Ministerial Council &mdash; Animal Health, Plant  Health, Common Agricultural Policy and Rural Development</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The next item of business is the Final Stage of the Commission for  Victims and Survivors Bill. I call the junior Minister Mr Gerry Kelly.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I apologise to the Minister of Agriculture and Rural  Development. I have received notice from the Minister that she wishes to make a  statement on the outcome of the North/South Ministerial Council (NSMC) meeting.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development (Ms Gildernew)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a  LeasCheann Comhairle. I will make a statement in compliance with section 52 of  the Northern Ireland Act 1998 on the ninth meeting of the North/South  Ministerial Council in the agriculture sector, which was held at the  Enniskillen campus of the College   of Agriculture, Food and  Rural Enterprise on Wednesday 30 April 2008. At that meeting, the Executive  were represented by the Minister of the Environment, Arlene Foster, and by me.  The Irish Government were represented by Mary Coughlan TD, the Minister for  Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, and &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v TD, the Minister for  Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. This statement has been agreed with  Minister Foster.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council noted progress on the activities in the draft  all-island animal health and welfare strategy, including: agreement on a common  chapter in the respective epizootic contingency plans for foot-and-mouth  disease, with common chapters for avian influenza and bluetongue to follow;  ongoing development of a report on the potential for joint data sharing, which  is expected to be completed by June 2008; continuing examination of the  feasibility of a joint approach to the electronic identification of sheep; the  development of common approaches to sheep scrapie genotyping; and the  development of a common approach to salmonella in line with an EU baseline  report, which is due to be published in May 2008.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council approved further measures to progress the  all-island approach to Aujeszky&rsquo;s disease in pigs and, in conjunction with  respective food safety standards agencies, consideration of the hygiene package  on the transmission of food-chain information with animals going to slaughter  and of the feasibility and priority of an all-island approach to Trichinella in  pigs.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council also noted plans for consultation and a future  cross-border event with key agriculture stakeholders from both jurisdictions to  discuss the all-island strategic approach.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">On the matter of plant health, the Council noted that the  Department of Agriculture and Rural Development has developed a draft plant  health strategy which includes a section on North/South co-operation. This is  consistent with the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food plant health  strategies. The Council also recognised the need to develop a more strategic  approach to cross-border co-operation on plant health and pesticide matters,  and agreed to establish a steering group to identify areas of mutual interest  in the plant health and pesticide areas.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council had a broad, wide-ranging discussion on issues  of common concern regarding the EU common agricultural policy (CAP). It noted  recent CAP reforms &mdash; in particular, the significant simplification of the  single farm payment scheme. Ministers noted the contents of the CAP health  check communication from the European Commission, along with conclusions from  the European Council. Ministers requested that officials remain in close  contact over CAP issues.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council received a presentation on cross-border rural  development. This centred on an innovative and strategic approach to  collaboration and communication on rural development programmes. This project  is aimed at fostering improved community relations in remote rural areas and  complementing the economic regeneration of disadvantaged cross-border regions.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Ministers noted the development of proposals for a rural  enabler project for submission to the Peace III programme. This project aims to  bring together people from both traditions, and migrants, to increase understanding  and to address issues of sectarianism and racism in a rural context.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council also considered a cross-border project under  INTERREG IVa to promote tailored rural development initiatives for a number of  the most disadvantaged rural regions. The Council agreed that DARD and the  Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs should continue to discuss  other aspects of co-operation that would benefit rural communities across the  region.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council agreed that its next meeting in the agriculture  sectoral format would take place in autumn 2008. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I call the Deputy Chairman of the Committee for Agriculture and  Rural Development, Mr Willie Clarke.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am getting things really badly wrong this morning. Mr Tom  Elliott.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">10.45 am</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development (Mr Elliott)</strong>:  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. In being asked to speak first today, I did not  expect to be changing parties as well. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span> If I was in a different party I might consider that.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Minister for her statement and recognise the  points which she has raised. I look forward to seeing the details of these  deliberations when the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD)  approaches the Committee on these matters, particularly the approved measures  relating to Aujeszky&rsquo;s disease in pigs. The Committee also looks forward to the  Minister&rsquo;s attendance at its meeting this afternoon, where we will be apprised  of the enhanced controls to prevent the spread of bluetongue in Northern Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee welcomes vaccination in England as a positive move against the spread of  this disease, and asks farmers not to import cattle and sheep to Northern Ireland  until further notice. Has the Minister had any discussion with her counterparts  in the South on the possibility of bluetongue&rsquo;s arriving in the Republic of Ireland? How would that situation be  dealt with by the Northern    Ireland officials?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister has identified a number of cross-border rural  development and other all-Ireland strategies. Can she direct me to the section  of her statement that deals with the strategies for saving the Northern Ireland  pig sector, or indeed the red meat sector? Where are the strategies for  protecting the Northern    Ireland poultry industry and for action on  fuel prices across the Province? Where is the welfare payment for Northern Ireland  farmers equivalent to what their counterparts receive in the Republic, and  where is the level playing field within the industry?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: I welcome the Deputy Chairperson&rsquo;s  comments on the progress that has been made. I look forward to the Committee  meeting this afternoon, where I will offer further details on the development  of a strategy on bluetongue vaccination. Although bluetongue was mentioned and  discussed at the North-South Ministerial Council meeting, that was around an  island-wide approach as opposed to a specific one.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">An outbreak of bluetongue in Louth would have implications  for people in south Armagh. The nature of the  disease means that we must consider dealing with it on an all-Ireland basis.  Our response would depend on the location of the outbreak in the South. As we  have done previously, we would liaise closely with our colleagues in the South,  and we would then consider whether restrictions should apply in the North. Much  depends on geography, and on where the first incursion occurs. Several options  are available, depending on circumstances. Thus, good cross-border communication  on the bluetongue threat is taking place, as it does on many other issues.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The other issues that the Member mentioned were not  discussed in any great detail at the NSMC meeting.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr W Clarke</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for her  statement. What plans does she have to secure the free movement of animals on  the island of Ireland? Will she also outline her plans  for a rural White Paper, and will that paper have an all-island dimension?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: As I stated in discussions on the  all-island animal health and welfare strategy, free movement of animals on the island of Ireland is one of my key priorities.  Although sheep can be moved around the island of Ireland  with relative ease &mdash; the industry has welcomed such arrangements &mdash; the free  movement of cattle is more complex. That is partly down to the 10-year ban &mdash;  lifted only a year ago &mdash;on the export of beef and live cattle from the North,  and the European authorities&rsquo; ongoing scrutiny of our control systems.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">From my discussions with stakeholders, I am acutely aware  of the apparent differences between North and South in our application of EU  rules on trade in cattle since the lifting of the export ban. My aim is  therefore to ensure, as far as possible, a level playing field. The all-island  animal health and welfare strategy is the right vehicle to tackle the issue of  the freer movement of cattle on the island. The rural White Paper was not  discussed at the NSMC meeting.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P J Bradley</strong>:  I am glad that you did not call Dominic or Mary Bradley this morning, Mr Deputy  Speaker.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">My main question concerned bluetongue, which Mr Elliott has  already raised. I look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s meeting with the Committee  this afternoon.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Cross-border rural development has been mentioned, and the  Narrow Water bridge project will slot nicely into the planned regeneration of  cross-border regions. I welcome that project, although I know that the Minister  cannot comment it.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Was the Treaty of Lisbon discussed at the meeting?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: The Member is correct; I cannot comment  on the Narrow Water bridge project, because that is the responsibility of my  Executive colleague Conor Murphy. Some discussion about the World Trade  Organization (WTO) negotiations took place at the NSMC meeting, but the Treaty  of Lisbon did not feature.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  thank the Minister for her statement. She refers to the feasibility of adopting  a joint approach to the electronic identification of sheep. Can she indicate  the timescale for such developments, given the existing problems with sheep  identification?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister said that the Department would:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;continue to discuss other aspects of co-operation  that would benefit rural communities across the region.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Can she give a flavour of those particular projects?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: Local action groups will put forward their  own plans. We want to offer them as much freedom as possible and we want to  take a bottom-up approach to projects that will be included in the rural  development programme. Therefore, I do not want to be too prescriptive or to  pre-empt the outcome of that work.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Tagging and identification of sheep is very much a live  issue. I am in discussions with the European Commission on issues that concern  electronic ID. I intend to have a dedicated meeting on sheep ID with industry  representatives shortly. The EU requires a blueprint by the end of 2009. We are  developing our plans, and we are liaising with the South to ensure that the  systems, North and South, are compatible and that our farmers are not  disadvantaged in any way when sheep-identification measures are introduced.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Irwin</strong>: As  far as I am aware, in Northern Ireland,  a programme to eradicate Aujeszky&rsquo;s disease in pigs is just about complete,  while a programme is barely under way in the Republic of Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Is there not a danger that, in the Minister&rsquo;s all-Ireland  approach, Northern Ireland  will be held back with regard to this disease?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: The industry has made good progress with  DARD on Aujeszky&rsquo;s disease. We should soon be in a position to approach Brussels to seek  recognition of our greatly improved Aujeszky&rsquo;s disease status. The South has  also made good progress on the disease. Although parallel status may be sought  from Brussels,  each case will be judged on its merits, and trade will not be affected by a  joint strategy. We could equally point to other animal disease issues. I am,  therefore, confident that we can move forward on this matter to achieve the  best outcome for the industry.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for her  statement, which is important with regard to co-operation. Will the Minister  outline what positive outcomes co-operation has delivered, in particular on  all-island sustainability and the energy strategy?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: We are seeking a positive outcome on the  energy issue. I have met Teagasc officials to ensure that our research  programmes complement each other and do not duplicate work that has been done  on both parts of the island. However, renewable energy was not on the agenda at  the NSMC meeting.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  I know that the Minister sometimes sees herself as the rural champion in the  Department of Agriculture and Rural Development. Will she accept that Orange  Halls play a key and integral role in many communities? Have she or her  counterparts considered funding for Orange Halls?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: That issue did not come up at the NSMC  meeting. Obviously, there has been funding for community halls across the  sector through the last rural development programme.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Doherty</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat. Will the Minister outline the positive, practical outcomes  of co-operation on an all-Ireland basis with regard to animal health and World  Trade Organization talks? Was there mention at the meeting, and are there  concerns in the Agriculture Departments, North and South, about those talks?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: There have been a number of positive  outcomes as a result of all-island co-operation on animal health. Those include  the development of largely similar systems of sheep identification;  co-operation on the exchange of data to facilitate trade in bovine animals  after the lifting of the BSE export ban; a broad alignment of border control  policies aimed at preventing the introduction of animal disease; co-operation  on contingency planning for exotic disease outbreaks, including agreement on a  common chapter in the respective epizootic contingency plans for foot-and-mouth  disease; and initiation of draft common chapters for avian influenza and  bluetongue. There is also agreement on a protocol on welfare during transport  breaches, and co-operation on testing regimes for TB and brucellosis in border  areas.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The strategic approach will enable the achievement of  further positive outcomes over the next year, all of which provide for meeting  the key aim of freer animal movements on the island.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The concern with the WTO is that Mandelson is negotiating  away a lot of Europe&rsquo;s strengths, and it is of  great concern, North and South, how we will be affected. The farmers&rsquo; unions  are particularly concerned, and the Ulster Farmers&rsquo; Union (UFU) and the Irish  Farmers&rsquo; Association (IFA) have held joint meetings with me and Mary Coughlan,  the Agriculture Minister in the South, on these issues.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Farmers have also made their views clear on the Lisbon  Treaty, which is also a cause for disquiet.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I want to comment on the issue of cross-border rural development.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister talked about the council receiving a  presentation on an innovative and strategic approach, aimed at fostering  improved community relations in remote rural areas and complementing the  economic regeneration of certain regions. What is the Minister doing to assist  isolated Protestant communities that have not yet availed of rural development  funding? It is an important issue, and people are losing out.</p>

		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: Pilot schemes have been introduced in  some of those areas, and the Department has been involved in some single  identity work. DARD and the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht  Affairs are supporting the rural community network and the Irish Rural Link  with an application under the &ldquo;building positive relations at the local level&rdquo;  theme of Peace III.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The programme, which is known as the rural enabler, will  seek to address issues of sectarianism and racism in rural areas, under the  following headings: young people; flags and emblems; housing; interfaces;  racism; community relations and community development; and rural institutions.  The total estimated cost of the programme of activities is &pound;2&middot;4 million, North  and South. Therefore, we are addressing the needs that the Member has  articulated.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  I, too, listened carefully to the Minister. What discussions has she had with  the Minister of the Environment, Arlene Foster, to ensure that the Planning  Service and the Environment and Heritage Service help to fast-track energy from  waste projects? Furthermore, what are the Minister&rsquo;s proposals for the pig, the  poultry and the red-meat sectors? Does she have any proposals in relation to  fuel costs?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: The issue is topical and timely.  Although it was not discussed specifically at last week&rsquo;s meeting of the  North/South Ministerial Council, I am sure that I will discuss the issue with  Minister Foster.</p>

		    <p class="H4StageHeading">Commission for Victims and Survivors Bill</p>
		    <p class="H4StageHeading">Final Stage</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister) (Mr G Kelly)</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion">That the Commission for Victims and Survivors Bill (NIA12/07)  do now pass.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. On 28  January 2008, the First Minister and deputy First Minister announced their  intention to appoint four victims&rsquo; commissioners. Furthermore, they announced  that the establishment of such a commission would require a change in the  legislation. We have now reached the penultimate stage in the enactment of that  legislation.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There was some intense debate in the Chamber during the  various stages of the Bill; however, the very fact that such a sensitive and  often difficult subject was debated shows how far we have come in recent times.  That in itself sends a message to such people as the perpetrators of last  night&rsquo;s attack that we are determined to forge ahead towards a new and better,  peaceful, more prosperous future.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Everyone who contributed to the debate expressed support  for the general thrust of what was being done to progress the Bill, although  some Members did not always agree with the precise detail of it. There is a  need to get the commission up and fully functioning, so that, at long last,  victims and survivors can have a real, strong voice &mdash; a voice that, surely,  they deserve. Therefore, I am pleased that we have reached this point, which is  a milestone for victims and survivors. I hope that, at some stage, we can look  back and realise that this was a defining moment for those in our society on  whom the impact of the events of the past four decades has been greatest.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">During the Bill&rsquo;s passage, we listened carefully to  Members&rsquo; concerns, and we gave due and careful consideration to the amendments  that were tabled. The Bill, as it now stands, is a genuine effort to reflect,  as far as is practicable, the wide-ranging debate that took place. During its  various stages, the First Minister and deputy First Minister were criticised  for delaying the progress of the Bill. Accelerated passage was sought, and the  process took longer than desired. The issues involved, however, are important,  and it would have been ill-advised not to give full consideration to the  concerns that were raised. Therefore, I make no apology for taking time to get  the Bill right.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">This Administration is delivering for victims and survivors  as promised, through the Bill and through the resources that have been secured  for victims and survivors.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I support the Bill, and I am  grateful that the priority and focus of the debate has been on meeting the  needs of victims and survivors. Over the past weeks, there has been much  debate; I hope that we are closer to the establishment of the victims&rsquo;  commission, which will offer the wealth of experience, expertise and skills  that are required to shape and deliver the important services that victims and  survivors need.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The legislation will establish a commission to acknowledge  and support ongoing efforts and to ensure that programmes are delivered  directly to victims and survivors, either by individuals or victims&rsquo; and  survivors&rsquo; groups. I hope that those groups will be guaranteed the secure  funding that is required to continue their worthwhile programmes. Go raibh  maith agat.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  The SDLP is mindful that today&rsquo;s Final Stage will amend the existing  legislation &mdash; the Victims and Survivors (Northern Ireland) Order 2006 &mdash; to  create a commission. Legislation already exists for the creation and  appointment of a Victims&rsquo; Commissioner. The SDLP has stated on record that its  preferred option was, in the first instance, the appointment of a single  Victims&rsquo; Commissioner. That, clearly, will not happen.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Along with other parties, we sought to amend the Commission  for Victims and Survivors Bill. The amendments were rejected, and that remains  a matter of concern for the SDLP. Therefore, we cannot support the Bill.  However, we are mindful of the need to make progress and, therefore, we will  not vote against the legislation today. It continues to be a matter of serious  disappointment that the Bill has been handled with such hypocrisy and dishonesty.  Despite the rhetoric, the additional appointments and the associated costs, the  Assembly has missed the opportunity to give the commission the powers it  requires to support victims effectively. That gives the lie to the  self-righteous public grandstanding that we have witnessed.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">During his contributions to the debate, junior Minister  Jeffrey Donaldson challenged my colleague Mark Durkan for not seeking to amend  the Bill at Westminster.  That is further hypocrisy, because there was no Bill at Westminster &mdash; it was an Order in Council,  which, as the junior Minister knows, cannot be amended. Also, Mark Durkan  questioned the commission&rsquo;s authority at the Committee Stage of that Order on 1  November 2006. He said:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;It is one thing for the commissioner to be able to  give advice, but there are issues about whether the victims commissioner will  be able to get the quality of attention and response from Departments that the  Commissioner for Children and Young People gets. We also need to address that  in the future.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">More importantly, during last week&rsquo;s debate on the proposed  amendments, junior Minister Donaldson compared the victims&rsquo; commission with the  Equality Commission for Northern    Ireland and the Northern Ireland Human  Rights Commission, in an attempt to defend his position on the number of  commissioners. That highlighted other disparities that he does not want to  rectify. The onus is on the junior Minister and the Office of the First  Minister and deputy First Minister to explain why the victims&rsquo; commission &mdash;  despite the Victims&rsquo; Commissioners&rsquo; receiving an enormous salary, compared with  other commissioners &mdash; should have such restricted powers.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The powers that the SDLP advocated would have given the  commission a legal basis to pursue victims&rsquo; interests with the vigour and  authority, consistent with internationally defined standards. Without the  inclusion of those principles, the commissioners&rsquo; ability to make a difference  will be limited. I expected it from the DUP, but the manner of the Bill&rsquo;s  passage exposes a side of Sinn F&eacute;in that undermines that party&rsquo;s stated  commitment to human rights and equality. It is my view &mdash; and that of the SDLP &mdash;  that victims&rsquo; interests remain prejudiced by the lack of consensus and failure  of leadership in the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: In  moving the Final Stage of the Bill, Mr Kelly said that everyone who had  participated in the debate agreed with the general thrust of the Bill. Where  has Mr Kelly been during the past weeks? It is absolutely clear that a  significant section of the House does not agree with the general thrust of the  Bill.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Three parties in this House made it clear that an existing  Order provided for the establishment of a commissioner. That was what should  have happened, and it was what the junior Minister Mr Kelly and his colleagues  were planning to do, until they failed to agree on an appointment. It was then  that we had the back-pedalling, and the sad stories of the people who had  missed their Christmas pudding. They failed to fulfil their responsibility and  their stated aim, which was to appoint a Victims&rsquo; Commissioner before the  summer recess of 2007. That was what they told us they would do, and now,  virtually a year later, they are still desperately trying to cover their  traces.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Let us not have any of that nonsense about Members of this  House being in agreement on this issue. They may agree that we wish to ensure  that the victims are properly provided for and cared for, and that the services  that they need are made available. However, to suggest that there is any  agreement on the thrust of the Bill is to misrepresent totally the view of the  House, or, at least, a significant section of it.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The junior Minister Mr Kelly was rarely in the Chamber for  the debates on the Bill. It is, at least, pleasant to see that three of the  four Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister (OFMDFM) Ministers  have made it to the Chamber for the Bill&rsquo;s Final Stage. However, where were  they during the serious discussions, when we rarely saw more than one of the  four of them, except, of course, when they all arrived with their embarrassed  colleagues who had remained outside the Chamber, to vote down any sensible  amendments?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">How can junior Minister Kelly say that OFMDFM gave its  &ldquo;full consideration&rdquo; to the concerns that were raised? What he calls &ldquo;full  consideration&rdquo; amounted to four weeks of discussions between the DUP and Sinn  F&eacute;in to try to resolve the complete anomalies in their approach, which were  exposed by the fact that reasonable amendments were tabled from this side of  the House. Let us, at least, accept the reality that this is, and remains, a  flawed Bill. It is the result of a flawed process. All that is happening in the  Chamber is that the DUP/Sinn F&eacute;in steamroller is rolling over everyone else,  though, in truth, it is more the case that Sinn F&eacute;in is steamrolling the DUP  Back-Benchers into submission until they are required to come in and vote.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There has been an absence of participation. Can you  imagine, Mr Deputy Speaker, during discussions about the needs of victims in  this Chamber, circumstances in which DUP Back-Benchers would be as silent as  they have been? That is an indication of their total embarrass&shy;ment. However  much junior Minister Donaldson may smile, the fact that not one of his  colleagues is down to speak in this debate is a clear indication of that  position.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I am going to speak.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: In  that case I apologise. It is most unusual for an Alliance Party Member to be  called before the first DUP contributor, Mr Deputy Speaker. The way in which  you have routed today&rsquo;s proceedings is a clear indication of the quality of the  speeches.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We are left with a defective Bill. Those who have insisted  on steamrolling the Bill through in its current form must show that they are going  to provide for the needs of victims, and demonstrate that the commission will  work, not just with the current four incumbents, but with the structures which,  by statute, they have established for the future. I remain extremely doubtful  whether that will be the case, although I wish the commissioners, if not the  Ministers, all the best in the difficult task that they have.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Despite your efforts to get me involved, Mr Ford, I remain  entirely neutral, as a Speaker should. I now call Mr Francie Molloy.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>:  Will the DUP speak?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle, I am certain that the DUP and the  other parties will be able to arrange their speaking rotas without Mr Ford&rsquo;s  help.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We have reached an important stage &mdash; the Final Stage of the  Commission for Victims and Survivors Bill. It is an incentive to go ahead and  provide for victims and survivors. I welcome Dolores Kelly&rsquo;s comment that her  party would not hold up the process any further and not vote against the Bill.  It is an indication that, having debated the issues &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: Is  the Member saying specifically that Dolores Kelly was not going to hold up the  process any further? That implies that, on some occasion, SDLP, Alliance Party  or Ulster Unionist Members have held up the process so far. Perhaps the Member  could elucidate when that was?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>:  If the Member looks back two or three weeks, even he will realise what those  parties have been up to. He should understand his own methods without the need  for me to explain them to him.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that we deal with the issue of victims and  survivors today. We must take the opportunity to involve them in the process,  so that they can begin to work with the commission and develop a strategy that  will deal with their needs and the issues that they want to raise. The Assembly  should not try to dictate to victims and survivors.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">11.15 am</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is very important to move the process forward. Given the  debate that Members have had and the various opinions expressed &mdash; which is fair  enough; there is no problem with that &mdash; I hope that all parties will come  together, support the commission, and give it the authority to deal with the  issues and get on with its work without interfering too much in its development.  I hope that no one will try to tie the commission down and impose conditions  that it must meet. The issue is very important, and today the Bill has reached  its Final Stage.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The division that has emerged during the debate should not  be carried through to the way in which we deal with victims. There have been  criticisms about who was, or was not, in the Chamber during the debates. Not  all Alliance Party Members &mdash; few as they are &mdash; are here today. One would have  thought that the party&rsquo;s Whip would have been able to summon all its MLAs if  its leader were so concerned about attendance. It is typical of the way in  which that party tries to tell everyone else what to do. Over the years, the  Alliance Party has tried &mdash; or at least it proclaims that it has tried &mdash; to bring  everybody together and get them to work together. It said that no matter what  the situation was, everybody should co-operate and take more time to develop  relationships. Now, the Alliance Party has become the party of division in the  Chamber rather than the party of co-operation.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that we, the majority of Members in the  Chamber, move the process on, give the commission the authority to deal with  the issues, and give the victims and survivors and their families the  opportunity to become involved. Let the process be victim-led from now on. Go  raibh maith agat.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I am grateful for the opportunity to speak. The original desire to create a  commissioner for victims and survivors of the Troubles was an honourable desire  to compensate, in some way, those people who suffered innocently at the hands  of terrorists. Therefore, an independent, neutral and respected figure was  supposed to serve victims and help our society to move beyond its regrettably  violent past. However, due to the joint actions of Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP, that  honourable intention has been slightly soiled by the grimy compromises that  those two parties have cajoled from each other.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The blatant inability of the Office of the First Minister  and deputy First Minister to agree on a single Victims&rsquo; Commissioner has led to  the fudge of having four commissioners. The First Minister and deputy First  Minister appointed those people and paid them salaries &mdash; presumably at the  taxpayers&rsquo; expense &mdash; only to discover that they could not legally carry out  their work. That has led us to the unfortunate Bill that we are completing  today.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In an attempt to stifle debate and protect its compromising  position, the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister forced the  Bill through the Assembly by accelerated passage, albeit that acceleration was  interrupted by self-made speed bumps. On 31 March, the deputy First Minister  said:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;It was implicit in the case for accelerated passage  in this instance that the First Minister and I do not wish to use that  procedure as a matter of routine for legislation on victims and survivors, or  more generally.&rdquo; &mdash; <span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; ">[Official Report, Vol 29, No 1, p46, col 2]</span></span></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The Ulster Unionist Party expects the Office of the  First Minister and deputy First Minister to abide by that statement. We expect  that no further victims&rsquo; legislation will be pushed through the House by means  of accelerated passage.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">My party has made it clear that it considers the current  definition of the word &ldquo;victim&rdquo; to be morally wrong. It allows those who  perpetrated acts of terrorism to be given the same status as those who suffered  at their hands. Despite all its claims, the DUP has failed to address that  issue, and the reason for that is that Sinn F&eacute;in would not let it do so.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We could not table an amendment on the issue for technical  reasons. However, we endeavoured to protect innocent victims by ensuring that  no commissioner or employee of a commissioner &mdash; who had a conflict-related  conviction &mdash; would be employed by the commission. Our amendment would have  protected innocent victims from being placed in the position in which they  would have had to seek help from former terrorists and victim-makers. However,  again, the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in rejected our amendment.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Junior Minister Donaldson&rsquo;s amendment is a laughable  attempt to address this issue. Clearly most, if not all, DUP Members would have  supported our amendment but were unable to do so. Why was that, Mr Deputy  Speaker? Again, it was because Sinn F&eacute;in would not let them.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There was a general consensus on the need to have a chief  commissioner, which would have given the commission direction and would have  ensured that the existing commissioners would not act as independents, serving  specific communities within their own remits. For the sake of innocent victims,  it is crucial that the commission acts as a comprehensive entity. Regardless of  every party supporting the idea of having a chief commissioner &mdash; including, I  believe, the majority of DUP Members &mdash; that has been denied to victims. Why was  that, Mr Deputy Speaker? Again, it was because Sinn F&eacute;in did not want it.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister (Mr M McGuinness)</strong>: Will the Member give way?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  Sorry, I am not giving way today.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We have seen a departmental fudge that gives the Office of  the deputy First Minister and First Minister &mdash; and I use that term explicitly:  deputy First Minister and First Minister &mdash; the power to introduce a chief  commissioner and to appoint a chief commissioner in the future. However, having  a power without the will to use it is the same as having no power at all.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Although this is a flawed piece of legislation and despite  the unsatisfactory manner in which it has been pushed through the House &mdash;  which, frankly, is a disgrace &mdash; the Ulster Unionist Party will support the work  of the commission.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I am sorry, I will not give way. We will support the work of the commission  because that is the right thing to do. However, let us not be under any  illusion: this Bill has been a fudge, largely dictated by Sinn F&eacute;in, the only  party in the Assembly with a violent history.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The DUP has gained very little movement from its position  as a party hell-bent on promoting and protecting its own position at the  expense of innocent victims in Northern    Ireland. The DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in should  reflect long and hard on what they have achieved today.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  This process has been a complete shambles since it was inherited by the Office  of the First Minister and deputy First Minister. There have been repeated  delays, and now a total fudge. The Assembly, as something that was supposed to  be putting victims&rsquo; needs first, has fallen well short of the mark.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The First Minister and deputy First Minister inherited a  situation in which they were required to appoint a single commissioner for  victims and survivors. They sat on that issue for a number of months and then  decided to re-advertise for a single commissioner. Even at that stage, there  was no talk of a commission. There was no mention of a commission until we had  the situation in which four commissioners designate were announced by OFMDFM.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There was no emergence of the concept of a victims&rsquo;  commission through the normal policy-making processes that are now tried and  tested in Northern Ireland,  and there was no consultation on the idea of having a victims&rsquo; commission. The  concept of a victims&rsquo; commission was very much an afterthought, designed to get  around the inability of the First Minister and deputy First Minister to agree  on the appointment of a single Victims&rsquo; Commissioner who would be capable of  representing the interests of victims across the spectrum in Northern Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We now have the bizarre situation in which four individuals  have been appointed without the proper legal framework for them to do their job  or the legal framework for the commission to exist. That has placed those  individuals in a very invidious situation and, frankly, places Assembly Members  in an extremely difficult situation, as inevitably personalities become part  and parcel of the process. We should focus on implementing proper structures to  fulfil the victims&rsquo; legislation mandate. Personalities should not be drawn into  that.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There have been opportunities to discuss this matter in  detail. Clearly, it was not initially appreciated that legislation would be  required. Indeed, it was only in March &mdash; long after the January announcement &mdash;  that legislation was introduced in the Assembly. Given the situation in which  we find ourselves, the Bill should have been given a Committee Stage, which  takes only six weeks. If there had been a Committee Stage, we could have had a  more constructive and less adversarial discussion on the issue. We would also  have had the opportunity to fashion proper amendments to be thrashed out by  Committee members and departmental officials. Perhaps a consensus would have  been reached that would have corrected the flaws in the legislation.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Accelerated passage was sought, very controversially, but  the brakes were then applied. That was a bizarre and totally unprecedented way  for any piece of Government legislation in these islands to be handled. Parties  have tabled amendments in good faith and in an attempt to improve the  legislation. Indeed, one party from the Office of the First Minister and deputy  First Minister made it known publicly that they had sympathy with those  amendments. Another bizarre situation emerged when the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in went  back into a huddle to try to cobble together some sort of fudge in an effort to  paper over the cracks.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Alliance Party is here to address the needs of victims  and to see that a robust solution is implemented to do so. However, we will not  hand out blank cheques. We have worked over the past 40 years to deliver peace  and stability in Northern    Ireland. Other parties that are represented  in the Chamber have joined that work rather late in the day, so we will take no  lectures on our efforts. Having fought so hard to have devolution restored in Northern Ireland,  we are not prepared to let the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in to do as they please. We will  not allow them to Balkanise Northern Ireland and merely manage the  divisions in our society, rather than moving forward and building a proper  shared future.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Alliance Party wants to have proper, effective  democratic institutions and a normalisation of democracy in Northern Ireland.  That means establishing a situation in which issues are debated on the Floor of  the Assembly, Government Ministers table Bills and motions, and other parties  table amendments. That is the normal process of any democratic Chamber and one  that we should celebrate, rather than criticise. Until such time as my party is  in a position to take its place in Government, it will continue to play the  role of a constructive opposition in the Chamber in the coming months and  years.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There are deep concerns in the community about the nature  of the victims&rsquo; commission. I stress that those have nothing to do with the  integrity of the individuals in question. Those concerns regard the structures  of the commission, and whether they will last beyond the current four nominees  for the body. People want a single, coherent strategy to deal with victims  across the board. There are concerns that the commission will mean a Balkanised  system whereby different groups in society, almost implicitly, identify more  closely with one commissioner than another. Similarly, staff on the commission  may work more closely with one commissioner than another.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We must move forward and overcome the deep divisions of the  past that were created by events in Northern Ireland. Those divisions  must not simply be set in stone but, rather, overcome. It should be realised  that people share much common ground in suffering and in how they access the  relevant services to address that suffering.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There is particular concern about the absence of a chief  commissioner.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I stress that the Bill merely provides for the First  Minister and the deputy First Minister to make such an appointment. That  appointment will remain subject to veto by either party in the Office of the  First Minister and deputy First Minister (OFMDFM). Bearing in mind that an  amendment providing for appointment of a chief commissioner was rejected, major  concerns exist over the prospect of the emergence of a chief commissioner at  some time in the future.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">11.30 am</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The appointment of a chief commissioner is not about  creating a hierarchy of victims or about asserting that one viewpoint is more  important than any other. It is about setting in stone the normal structures  expected in any public body, whether that be the Equality Commission or the  Human Rights Commission. It is about ensuring adherence to proper structures,  proper administrative procedures and, in particular, proper financial  procedures, not least because public money is at stake. Equally, it is  important that all staff operate coherently and cohesively, and report to a  single individual on the body.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The party Whips will no doubt ensure that the Bill becomes  law. The commission will become a legally constituted body, and the Alliance Party  will work with it. However, we shall seek to overcome those flaws in the  commission&rsquo;s constitution for which the Bill is responsible. We shall use our  best endeavours to ensure that the commission delivers for victims in a single,  coherent manner.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  We are on the brink of legislative change that will deliver for victims. It is  important to repeat what I said yesterday: the DUP has changed neither its mind  nor its position on the Bill. Then, as now, we have victims&rsquo; best interests at  heart. The Bill provides the framework for good and proper delivery of help and  support to victims and survivors. That help and support has been withheld for  too long.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  The Member says that the DUP has been consistent and has not changed its  position. Will he inform the House at what stage the DUP changed from  supporting the appointment of a single commissioner to its current position,  which is that the appointment of a commission is the best way forward for Northern Ireland?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I do not agree with the Member. The DUP&rsquo;s position has been consistent; we have  delivered. Our focus is clear: we are working on behalf of the victims. An  example of that may be found in the Budget, wherein &pound;36 million is allocated  directly to victims. Never before has that been done.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  In the absence of any guidance from the First Minister or the deputy First  Minister, the Member may be able to detail exactly how that &pound;36 million will be  spent. Will he confirm that the Health Service has already spent much of it in  treating victims and survivors? How much control will individual commissioners  have over allocation of those funds?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  The Member is correct: &pound;36 million has been set aside. The decision on how it  is to be spent has yet to be taken. However, that will be decided, and our  position is clear. The Member will have an opportunity to have input into that  process, as will all Members.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We welcome statements from the SDLP, the Alliance Party and  the Ulster Unionists that they will work with the commission. That is a step  forward.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Never before has &pound;36 million been set aside for victims  alone; never before has a commission for victims been in place. Things have  moved on. The money is in place, the commission is in place, and the legislation  is a step in the right direction. This Assembly has awarded much more money  from its Budget than any previous Westminster Government or any Govern&shy;ment  made up of Assembly parties ever allocated.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Let us deliver that money to those who need it most. Many  victims are not members of victims&rsquo; groups, and those people must be  considered. Until now, they have borne their sorrow and burdens on their own.  We have a duty to respond to them directly. The Commission for Victims and  Survivors Bill gives us an opportunity to deliver for all victims, whether they  be groups or individuals.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I urge Members to move on.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Irwin</strong>:  Although Members from several parties have been vocally opposed to the Bill,  when it came to Divisions on the various stages of the Bill, very few of those  Members &mdash; particularly from Mr Kennedy&rsquo;s party &mdash; actually voted. If those  Members were as concerned as they said they were, they should have been turned  up to vote.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I thank the Member for that intervention. As has been mentioned, the Hansard  reports can be checked, and the names of those Members who were present and  participated &mdash; as well as those who did not &mdash; will be clear for all to see. My  friend is correct that there were absences on the part of the UUP. However,  that party can answer for itself.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I am somewhat confused. Is the DUP trying to build a consensus on this issue,  or to stoke up division? <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There are guffaws from a sedentary position. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. Members were reminded yesterday that all remarks must be  made through the Chair. The rule has not changed overnight.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  The Ulster Unionist Party has made its position quite clear, and Mr Kennedy has  set that out. We will support the victims&rsquo; commission when it is established,  but we do not like the way in which it has been created, nor do we like the  political fudge and the machinations surrounding its creation. The UUP does not  believe that that does justice to the real victims. Frankly, we believe that it  is a disgrace. If we are being asked to vote for something that is a disgrace,  I am afraid that certain parties are on a different planet.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  The point that I made is that some Ulster Unionist Party Members were not  present here to vote either for or against the Bill. According to the Hansard  reports, the Member&rsquo;s party and its Members have not been present in the  Chamber when they should have been to make their opinions clearly known.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We have moved forward. I hope that Basil McCrea can move  forward as well. The debate is over and the discussions have concluded. Now is  the time to move forward and deliver for the victims.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The DUP has been consistent and honest. We have delivered  in the past, and we are about to do so again in respect of victims. The money  that has been set aside and the creation of the commission is proof of that  delivery. We are delivering for the people who have suffered through the  Troubles in this Province.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The victims are our focus and our priority. I ask Members  to support the legislative change before us to ensure that we can move forward.  Let all the posturing and division from certain parties be left in the past.  Let us go forward together and support the victims.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  Many people will be relieved that the Assembly has reached the stage at which  the finalisation of the legislation is at hand and that some structure will be  put in place to channel help towards victims and to represent them. However,  some have used the legislative process and this debate to engage in  point-scoring, nit-picking and finding excuses not to offer support.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I was not planning to speak in this debate until I heard  the speech from Mr Kennedy on behalf of the Ulster Unionist Party. Although I  have a lot of time for Mr Kennedy, I have never heard such a whingeing,  self-justifying, hypocritical and political-point-scoring speech in my life.  That was not becoming of him or of the serious issue that we are addressing.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. Is it not unparliamentarily to use the  term &ldquo;hypocritical&rdquo; in respect of another Member of this House?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  I imagine that if it was unjustified, it would not be in order. However, since  I think that it is probably justified &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. I ask the Member to withdraw his remark.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  I will withdraw the remark, but only in so far as other Members of &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister) (Mr  Donaldson)</strong>: On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. I have been taking  careful notes of the debate. Mrs Kelly described my position as being one of  &ldquo;hypocrisy and dishonesty&rdquo;. You did not ask her to withdraw those remarks, but  you are asking my colleague to withdraw a remark that contained the word  &ldquo;hypocrite&rdquo;. Can we have some equity in the Chamber?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: If there had been an objection, I would have asked Mrs Kelly to  withdraw her remarks.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Mr Donaldson)</strong>: I formally object to the comments that were made  by Mrs Kelly.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I hope that the Member will allow me to permit Mr Wilson to  continue his speech.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  Many people would perceive what Mr Kennedy was involved in as hypocritical and  as a display of double standards.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. Some time ago, did you not clarify, for  the benefit of the Assembly, that, while it was not appropriate to refer to  individuals as &ldquo;hypocrites&rdquo;, one could refer to a party as &ldquo;a bunch of  hypocrites&rdquo;?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  That being the case &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Allow me to respond, Mr Wilson. That is correct, Mr McCrea.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  That being the case, the position of all of the people to my right could be  perceived as being hypocritical in a number of ways. First, they were  hypocritical in the words that were issued this morning, and secondly &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  No. Let me just finish this point.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, the record of the Assembly&rsquo;s debate &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. Have you or have you not asked the  Member for East Antrim to withdraw his remark?  Have you or have you not heard that withdrawal? Will you or will you not tell  the House that you accept the Member&rsquo;s withdrawal?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I am happy that the Member withdrew the remark.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  I have withdrawn the remark. Further&shy;more, I clarified it by saying that it was  not only one person who was guilty of the accusation that I made, but a whole  bunch. Let me give some justification for that. We have heard  self-justification from Mr Kennedy today. However, so intensely did his party  feel about the issues, so passionate was it about the changes that were  required, and so deeply supportive of its position were its members, that half  of them did not bother turning up to vote &mdash; and the record will show that.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Shame.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  That is how deeply the Members on my right felt about the issue.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  I will give way to Mr Kennedy, and I hope that he will provide some explanation  as to why his party colleagues did not turn up to vote on the amendments.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  When one thinks of shame, and when one thinks of people who will, and should,  be ashamed of themselves when they examine the voting record, none should be  more ashamed than Sammy Wilson and his party colleagues, who went into the same  Lobby as provisional Sinn F&eacute;in.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  Let me come to that now &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. I remind Members that this is a serious debate about a  serious subject, and Members will not do credit to the House if they continue  with this style of debate.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. I ask Mr Kennedy to withdraw his  remarks, because there is no party in this Chamber registered as provisional  Sinn F&eacute;in.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  He did not say that you were a party.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>: I  did not raise that as a question; I was challenging what Mr Kennedy said. There  is no party called provisional Sinn F&eacute;in. It must be made clear that the party  is called Sinn F&eacute;in.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will Mr Kennedy please clarify his remarks?</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">11.45 am</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I am happy to clarify that I did not actually list a party, but said &ldquo;Members  of provisional Sinn F&eacute;in&rdquo;. If Mr Molloy claims that he is not or never has been  a member of provisional Sinn F&eacute;in, that is news to most of us. However, I did  not indicate a political party in my description.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>:  The Member said that the DUP went into the Lobby along with provisional Sinn  F&eacute;in. Given that there is no registered party in this Chamber called  provisional Sinn F&eacute;in, I again ask the Member to withdraw his remark.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  To give perfect clarify: I said that Members of the DUP went into the same  Lobby as Members of provisional Sinn F&eacute;in. That is an indisputable fact.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Mr G Kelly)</strong>: On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. There is no  organisation called provisional Sinn F&eacute;in &mdash; full stop. Therefore, there could  not have been anyone going anywhere with members of provisional Sinn F&eacute;in  because that organisation does not exist.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: As Deputy Speaker, I clarify that there is no party called  provisional Sinn F&eacute;in. If there is any further unhappiness about the matter, I  suggest that Members refer to the Hansard report, and the matter can be raised  at the next meeting. Are Members happy with that? Please continue, Mr Wilson.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. The real shame is that Members of the Ulster  Unionist Party have stood here today wringing their hands about this  legislation and talking about the shame of it. However, when they tabled  amendments to the Bill, they could not even get the support of half their own  party, who were so indifferent that they did not bother turning up to vote. I  feel absolutely no shame about what we, as a party, have done. We made a  promise, and these are the promises &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  I do not mind the chittering behind me, because I know that I am getting  somewhere with the Members who are involved.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. For the last time, I ask Members to make all their remarks  through the Chair. If they persist in interrupting, I will apply Standing Order  60, and Members know what that means.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  I do not mind a wee bit of chittering, because I know that if it is going on  beside me, I probably have made the point that I wanted to.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Let me make something clear: we made a promise that, first,  we would secure resources for victims. That has been done. People can question  how those resources will be spent. Indeed, I even heard a derogatory comment,  which I think came from a sedentary position on the SDLP Benches, that some of  the resources would go to the Health Service to help victims. If that is the  kind of help that victims require, is that not a good place for those funds to  go? Some groups will benefit from the resources immediately, and some groups  will benefit from a further dispersal of the funds through the victims&rsquo; strategy.  Securing those resources is the first promise that was made, and that has been  done.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  No, I will not give way &mdash; let me finish my point.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The second promise that we made was to seek a way of  dealing with the issue of victims. There is a certain amount of embarrassment  to the Benches on my right about that issue because, for the four years that  the Ulster Unionist Party was in the lead position in the Assembly and had the  opportunity to introduce legislation on the matter, it did not do so. Of  course, therefore, that party is somewhat embarrassed. Its members will chip  and chirp about the legislation, but at least we said that we would do  something about the issue of victims, and we have sought to deliver on that  promise.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I thank the Member for giving way; it will give him time to think. I want to  make it clear that I did not make a remark from a sedentary position about  expenditure on the Health Service; I was attempting to expose the fact that much  of the &pound;36 million involved is not new money and will be spent as was  originally intended.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  Of course, some of the money will include old money; I never suggested that it  was all new money. It will be an amalgamation of old and new money. The point  is that &pound;36 million has been allocated to victims, which is more than was  available previously. How that will be spent will be determined by victims&rsquo;  needs. If those needs are health related, for example, surely it is right that  the money is spent in that area.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There have been a number of complaints about the nature of  what has been achieved through the Bill. I listened to what Alliance Party  Members have said about the Balkanisation of politics in Northern Ireland,  and the fact that Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP must now have input into the process.  Other parties have also had input. Such Balkanisation, whether they like it or  not, is something that the Alliance Party has been preaching about for years &mdash;  its Members have always argued of the need for inclusivity. The belief that  inclusivity can be achieved at the same time as one particular party is getting  its way illustrates the naivety of the Alliance Party and the Ulster Unionist  Party.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Mr Donaldson)</strong>: Does the Member agree with me, as one who was  present when the institutions that we are now operating were agreed on Good  Friday 1998, that the architects of the current structures &mdash; and Mr McNarry  talks about vetoes &mdash; were the Ulster Unionist Party, the SDLP and the Alliance  Party? They created the system that is in place. When it comes to hypocrisy,  all three parties are guilty.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  That is exactly the point: they did create the system. Whether parties like it  or not, in finding a way forward when there are differences of opinions, no  party is always going to get its own way.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  Can any party get a fair deal?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  Yes; we got a fair deal, which I will come to. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. I am not sure how many more times I will have to advise  Members to make their remarks through the Chair. At some stage, I will have to  take action.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  Again, the discomfort on the Benches to my right is something that those  Members have to account for.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">At the end of the process, the victims have got a fair  deal; additional money is available; and a commission has been set up that will  be able to gather and channel the concerns of the victims, consider a strategy  for them and dispense the money. That is a better deal than that delivered by  the Ulster Unionist Party, which is perhaps one of the reasons for its members&rsquo;  discomfort.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In order to achieve consensus in the House, Members have to  work their way through party differences. The outcome has been that we now have  a commission that will deal with victims, and legislation now exists that  allows for the appointment of a chief commissioner. The four commissioners have  said that they believe, from their work to date, that they can work together.  For example, they have rotated the chairmanship of their meetings, and they  believe that they can speak with one voice.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">If the commissioners believe that they do not currently  need a chief commissioner, and if there is uncertainty among some of the  parties as to whether a chief commissioner is required, the best that we can do  is to provide legislation that will allow a chief commissioner to be appointed  if necessary. That is what politics is all about. Perhaps if the party to my  right had understood what negotiations were about and how to get what they want  in negotiations, they would have been able to demonstrate that flexibility.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The legislation will provide the flexibility to allow a  chief commissioner to be appointed. However, if the commission feels that it  can operate without a chief commissioner, the legislation will give it the  freedom to do that. Why should the legislation fall on the basis that something  should be imposed on the commission that it believes it does not need? If a  chief commissioner is needed, this House, the Executive, and the Office of the  First Minister and deputy First Minister have the ability to appoint one. That  is a reasonable way out of the impasse that was reached.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In the future, if we decide that we no longer want to have  the commission in its present form &mdash; or if we decide that we want a single  commissioner instead of a commission &mdash; the legislation gives us the ability to  make those changes. That is what the parties who are objecting to this Bill  wanted.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Kennedy talked about employment rights. The amendment  that the DUP proposed stated that the commission could not employ anybody with  a criminal conviction, and, legally, that is the most that can be done. Therefore,  we addressed that point.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The definition of a victim is something that the DUP would  like to see changed. The current definition is not acceptable.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Why was nothing done about that?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  We have reached this stage because when the Ulster Unionist Party had the  ability to deal with that issue, it dithered and procrastinated, and it failed.  When direct rule &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  Let me finish the point first.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:<span class="Italic"> </span>It failed.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  The Member will not give way because he does not want to engage in debate.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  I will engage in debate &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic"><span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. Two Members cannot stand up at the same time, and Members  cannot shout at each other in the manner that has been happening. Before  Standing Order 60 is applied, perhaps Members will give this debate the respect  that it deserves.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  The issue was dealt with under direct rule because it was not dealt with when  the opportunity existed previously. Under direct rule, a definition of a victim  was produced that my party is not happy with. However, the competency did not  exist at that point to make changes to the definition. I hope that we will  produce a definition that is acceptable. That issue will be addressed through  the forum that is being set up.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">At least the DUP has sought to address that issue in a way  that does not &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  I will give way in a minute or two, because I know that Mr Basil McCrea is keen  to be heard once again.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There is no point in pretending that this issue could have  been dealt with, at that stage, in the way in which the Ulster Unionist Party  wanted. It is much better to consider a way in which we can address that issue properly.  Had it been addressed in the previous Assembly, perhaps there would be a much  better definition in law than the one that we currently have.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I will attempt to deal with this issue with the respect that it demands. The  Member made a point about dealing with the issue when the opportunity existed.  As far as the Ulster Unionist Party is concerned, the definition of a victim  cannot be changed unless the long title of the Bill is changed. We asked for  the long title to be changed so that this issue could be confronted. The DUP  had the opportunity to do that, but fudged it. The Member is now prevaricating  and filibustering &mdash; talking at the top of his voice to try to avoid the issue.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">People will not understand why we have not dealt with the  matter of the definition of a victim &mdash; that is our job. We should have tackled  that now; and the Member agrees.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  Of course I agree that the issue should be tackled, and a mechanism has been  set up to try to deal with that. As far as the long title of the Bill is  concerned, the legal advice &mdash; and the Member who made the intervention is well  aware of this &mdash; indicated that the long title could not be changed.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not know the details of the legal advice. However, it  was accepted that the long title could not be changed at that stage and,  therefore, the issue of definition could not be dealt with.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">12.00 noon</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I am happy to examine that matter in more detail. The Ulster Unionist Party&rsquo;s  under&shy;standing was that the definition could not be changed unless the long  title was changed. If there is another way of changing the definition of  &ldquo;victim&rdquo;, I would be pleased to explore how that most contentious of issues can  be tackled. That is one of the most fundamental problems that the Ulster  Unionist Party has with the Bill, and many other Members share that concern.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  That concern is shared by other Members. I have made it clear that that concern  is shared by my party, the SDLP and the Alliance Party. The only party that has  no difficulty with the definition of victims, as it stands, is Sinn F&eacute;in. We  must look for ways of dealing with that issue. The DUP is happy to investigate  whether that can be dealt with through a private Member&rsquo;s Bill, through  consultation with the forum for victims and survivors, which may be able to reach  agreement on that contentious issue, or in whatever other way is available. I  accept that that is the one outstanding major issue that must be dealt with.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There has been criticism in respect of the ability of one  individual on the commission to use the power of veto, and that has been dealt  with through negotiation. The only other issues that will require consensus are  matters that would have had to be dealt with &mdash; in the first instance &mdash; by the  First Minister and the deputy First Minister anyhow and, therefore, if  consensus were reached between them, it is unlikely that consensus would not  have been reached in the commission. That issue was raised at the start of the  process.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  am grateful to the Member for eventually giving way on the issue of consensus,  and for coming back to that. About 10 minutes ago in his rant, he said that no  one party could have its way in a consensus situation. Six weeks ago, when the  Alliance Party first tabled amendments in an effort to improve the workings of  the commission in respect of the voting system and the appointment of a chief  commissioner, four of the five parties agreed that there was merit in that.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Can the Member explain why one party has had its own way?  He was not in the Chamber yesterday when I congratulated Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n on her  ability to enforce her Whip on the DUP Back-Benchers. It is clear that that has  happened.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  I cannot understand that approach. The Alliance Party appears to have the  impression that only its amendments could have dealt with the issues about  which Members had concerns, and that, if the issues were not dealt with in its  preferred way, they were not being dealt with properly at all. The same outcome  has been achieved by examining other ways in which those matters could be  addressed &mdash; namely that there is not the power of veto, we have the potential  for a chief commissioner, we have the ability to change the shape of the  commission and the number of commissioners, and we can ensure that people with  criminal records are not employed by the commission.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">OFMDFM&rsquo;s amendments differed from the wording of the  amendments that the Alliance Party proposed. Nevertheless, they achieved the  same objective. It is a bit infantile of the Alliance Party to now say that,  simply because the amendments that were accepted &mdash; although they were designed  to reach exactly the same objective as those designed by the Alliance Party &mdash;  did not have the Alliance Party&rsquo;s wording, that they had to be opposed.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>:  Perhaps the Member can explain why, if the amendments proposed by Mr Donaldson  achieved exactly the same objectives and were exactly the same as the  amendments tabled by Mrs Kelly and myself, among others, it was necessary to  put forward amend&shy;ments that differed from what had already been tabled.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  Of course the amendments were not exactly the same, although the outcome has  been the same, namely that there is the potential, when required, for a chief  commissioner.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Alliance Party may, regardless of how the commissioners  designate believe they can behave, wish to impose on them an arrangement that  they say is not needed because they can work things out among themselves. If  the Alliance Party is now involved in imposition of that nature, even though  the commissioners designate have said that they have had no difficulty to date  &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  The Member is making the argument that there is no need for a chief  commissioner because the four current incumbents of the commission are capable  of sorting things out between themselves. Is it good practice to design  structures of governance around particular individuals who may be there at a  particular time, or is it better to design them to be robust and able to deal  with a number of different circumstances? I cannot think of any other precedent  in which, because the current incumbents are said to be fine, there is no need  to put in place the proper structures for account&shy;ability, particularly on  issues regarding finance. I find that totally bizarre.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  That is not in fact what has been done, because the law allows, if there should  be a change and the current arrangements are seen not to be working, for the  First Minister and the deputy First Minister to appoint a chief commissioner,.  That flexibility is there.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We are coming to the end of the process of this  legislation. As all of the other parties have accepted, it is important that,  once the legislation goes through, we work to ensure that there is an effective  mechanism for dealing with the issues surrounding victims. I hope that, despite  the political points that have been made &mdash; perhaps necessarily made, in a  Chamber such as this &mdash; once this Stage of the Bill has passed, all parties will  work with the commissioners to ensure that there is effective delivery for  victims.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I wish to say at the outset, on behalf of the Ulster Unionist Party, that first  and foremost the most important issue is the welfare of victims &mdash; genuine  victims. We have fought, and continue to fight, for their well-being. I commend  my colleague Mr Kennedy for his excellent speech, which I heard both on the  television monitors and when I was in the Chamber. It obviously hit the nail on  the head on a number of occasions, judging by the reaction of other Members in  the Chamber.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">A number of suggestions have been made. When Mr Shannon was  speaking I asked him whether he was trying to build consensus or stir up  division. Our party has made its point through all the Stages of this legislation.  Our record is clear. We have identified the very real concerns and  disappointments that we had, but it has become apparent that there is a cosy  coalition between the two largest parties. There is a political fudge that is  designed to get them through this particular issue, and no amount of  interventions, debates or amendments will make any difference.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Even the combined votes of the Ulster Unionist Party, the  Social Democratic and Labour Party, the Alliance Party and the Green Party  would not be enough to overturn the decisions that have been made. The process  of this legislation is a complete and utter sham, and when people look at this  from outside this ivory tower, they will see, with some concern, that we did  not address the issue of the definition of &ldquo;victim&rdquo;. We did not address the  issue concerning the appointment of four commissioners, which many people think  is a strange decision, nor did we address the issue concerning the possible  compromise position of having a chief commissioner.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Despite all of that, having had our say, our party then  resolved to support the generality of the Bill. We do want to have some sort of  commission that will tackle the needs of the victims. People have pointed  fingers and said that we were not in the Chamber yesterday to vote, as if in  some way that meant that we do not care about victims, or we are not doing it  in the right way. I see people nodding, and I am quite prepared to debate the  point in public outside the Chamber with anybody here now that is prepared to take  it on. How can anybody &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I will of course give way in just a moment.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">How can anybody not be in favour of supporting victims? It  is ridiculous. Sammy Wilson is trying to argue that black is white and that  good is bad. Nobody in their right mind could do anything other than support  victims. The big question, of course, as Sammy Wilson has accepted, is how to  define a victim.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  Perhaps the Member would explain why half of his own party felt so unconcerned  about their amendment that they did not bother turning up to vote?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  Mr Basil McCrea will undoubtedly agree with me that the arithmetic of this  place was the real reason why it was not possible for the Ulster Unionist Party  to defeat Sinn F&eacute;in on the issue of victims: it was because the DUP supported  Sinn F&eacute;in.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  It is a two-party coalition.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order; the rules of this House apply to all Members, not just to  some. The majority of Members have been extremely good and have taken the  debate seriously. A few, unfortunately, have not, and that is to be regretted.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I thank Mr Kennedy for his erudite intervention,  which clearly demonstrates the political reality. If this debate has achieved  nothing else, it has shown quite clearly that when there is a DUP/Sinn F&eacute;in  axis, there is nothing that the rest of the Members can do about it. It does  not matter whether cross-community controls are in place, whether reason is on  the side of their opponents, or whether people disagree with their argument &mdash;  the DUP/Sinn F&eacute;in axis cannot be stopped.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I will give way in just a moment, Mr Storey.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I cannot recall the DUP/Sinn F&eacute;in axis accepting an  amendment to this Bill or any other Bill that has been proposed by other  Members. That is not the way to proceed. If we are genuine about building  consensus and about building a future for this place, it will not rest on a two-party,  cosy coalition. This is supposed to be a mandatory coalition of all parties,  and the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in are not taking other points of views on board.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>: I  thank the Member for giving way. If he is so concerned about what he terms the  &ldquo;DUP/Sinn F&eacute;in axis&rdquo;, and he and his party cannot turn up to vote when required  to; when will the Ulster Unionist Party do what we know it does not have the  capacity to do, which is to follow its own convictions, leave the Executive and  ask its two Ministers to walk out with it?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Will he also explain &mdash; if he is as concerned about victims  as he says his party is &mdash; why his party, while occupying a lead role in  Government, allowed out of prison murderers and criminals who created victims?  He has the bare-faced cheek to come into this House and accuse the DUP <span class="B1SpeakersNameChar"><span style="font-size:11.0pt; font-weight:normal; ">of  not doing anything for victims.</span></span></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  We did not go into power with them.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Mr Donaldson)</strong>: Yes you did.<span class="Italic"> </span></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span> Order; if the  debate becomes any more unruly, I have the power to suspend it for an hour,  which would be an absolute shame.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. An issue has been raised about why parties in  previous Administrations did not bring forward legislation to deal with  victims. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As far as I am aware, any party may bring forward  legislation at any time. Therefore, when people ask the Ulster Unionist Party  why it did not do so, our response is to ask them the same question &mdash; if it was  such a big issue, why did they not bring forward legislation?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Storey&rsquo;s question about whether Ulster Unionists should  be considering leaving the Assembly leads me to wonder whether that is what he  wants us to do.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Does he prefer to be in a genuine cosy coalition with just  &ldquo;themselves alone&rdquo; on the opposite Benches? Is that what he wants? The Assembly  might as well accept &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms D Kelly</strong>:  Will the Member acknowledge that in 1998, the people of Ireland, North and  South, agreed the terms of the Good Friday Agreement &mdash; the agree&shy;ment under  which the DUP now operates? One of the agreement&rsquo;s accomplishments is that acts  such as that which happened last night are now, thankfully, rare.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I share Mrs Kelly&rsquo;s sense that her party and mine did the heavy lifting for  peace. Our parties tackled the hard issues head on. My party was honest and  true. It did not say one thing to the electorate and do another &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span> It stood by its principles.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Mr Donaldson)</strong>: Will the Member give way?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I will give way in a moment. My party stood by its principles then, and it  stands firm again. When it comes to the issue of victims, it does what it  believes is best for them; it puts them at the very forefront of what it wants  to achieve &mdash; not just because it is right, but because it is necessary for  progress.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Mr Donaldson)</strong>: Will the Member give way?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I will have to now, because I said earlier that I would.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Mr Donaldson)</strong>: I thank the Member for giving way. He said that  the Ulster Unionist Party was, at all times, honest with people and stood by  its principles. Although it was before his time, I remind him that his party  once had an election slogan: &ldquo;No guns, no Government&rdquo;. The Ulster Unionist  Party said that it would not go into Government until paramilitary guns had  been dealt with. Yet, that party went into Government without a single rusty  bullet having been decommissioned. How did it stick to its principles then? <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. I ask Members to speak to the Bill, which is the subject of  the debate. In doing so, perhaps they will be somewhat more restrained in their  comments.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I will, of course, speak to the Bill, Mr Deputy Speaker. Never, never, never,  never has my party done anything other than defend victims. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">When ordinary people outside the Chamber look at what has  happened in the debate, they will see the shenanigans that have taken place.  They will point the figure and will ask which Members are genuine about the  matter and want to sort it out. I agree with Mr Wilson on many issues, one of  which is that the people who shout loudest usually have most to fear.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Let me say clearly that the Ulster Unionist Party will  support the victims&rsquo; commission because it is the only show in town. Party  Members do not like the way at which it was arrived. We do not like its  constitution. However, we are willing to do what is right for the victims of  conflict and the people of Northern    Ireland. No amount of prevarication and  muddying of the waters &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Simpson</strong>:  On a point of clarification, will the Member confirm that his former leader, Mr  Trimble, and Mr Mallon launched a document in the Craigavon Civic Centre that  related to the definition of a victim, and that that is where it all started?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Mr Deputy Speaker &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. The Member is entitled to be heard.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Mr Deputy Speaker, you have, with considerable patience, asked that Members  address the matter at hand.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  Will the Member accept that when the DUP had an opportunity to change the  definition of &ldquo;victim&rdquo; it failed to do so, because it could not get agreement  from its partner in crime, Sinn F&eacute;in? Mr Wilson practically accepted that every  party except Sinn F&eacute;in agreed that the definition of &ldquo;victim&rdquo; should be  changed. The DUP is being held to ransom. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. The definition of &ldquo;victim&rdquo; is not part of the Bill, which  means that we have once again moved off the subject.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  It should be part of the Bill.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  It is obvious &mdash; and regrettable &mdash; that there is not consensus on the issue. The  Members to my left should have proceeded with this piece of legislation in a  seemly way, but instead they chose to stir it up again. We have made our  position clear. When people come to judge the DUP&rsquo;s actions, they will not  accept that the party did this properly. Many members of the party to my left  agree with the issues that we have raised. I know that because, like me, they  will have constituents who say that they are unhappy about what has happened,  that it is a political fudge, and that it is not the right way to proceed.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  I thank the Member for giving way. Mr McCrea is vexed because there is going to  be a victims Bill. Mr McCrea and his party built their hopes on the fact that  there would not be a victims Bill; that would have pleased them immensely.  Today, they hang their heads in shame, because something has been achieved that  they never had the guts, will or determination to do.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I thank the Member for giving way. Contrary to Lord Morrow&rsquo;s comments, a  victims Bill has been in existence since 2006. What we are supposed to be  discussing today is the establishment of a commission, because the DUP and Sinn  F&eacute;in could not agree on the appointment of one commissioner.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I want to conclude my speech, provided that there are no further &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>A Member</strong>:  There is consensus on that.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Had it not been for that comment &mdash; made from a sedentary position &mdash; I would  have forgotten that Sinn F&eacute;in was here. It is amazing that it is not &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">When it gets to this point it is important that we send out  the right message to those victims who have suffered so horrendously over the  past 30 to 40 years. We, as a party, will work with the commission and we wish  it well. However, we are disturbed that we were not able to deal with a number  of important issues.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Nevertheless, the democratic process is such that the DUP  and Sinn F&eacute;in have brought a Bill; we have highlighted certain deficiencies; a  vote will be taken and the Bill will be carried. However, I hope that, if it  does not work out in the way that they anticipate, they will have the good  grace to acknowledge that the points made in the Chamber were not only right  but helpful. I hope that they stop the party political bickering in a bid to  win political points, because this is an important matter.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  When Sammy Wilson, who has now left the Chamber, concluded his remarks &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  He has moved position again.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I see that he has returned. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I did not spot you in that suit, Sammy &mdash; it is not glaring  enough.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">When Sammy Wilson was in the Chamber, to which he has now  returned, he said that all Members of the Assembly should:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;work to ensure that there is an effective mechanism  for dealing with the issues surrounding victims.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Mr Wilson went on to say that, after all the  political points have been made and the legislative process completed, we  should all work with the victims&rsquo; commission. Mr Basil McCrea has just  expressed the same sentiments. As Dolores Kelly said, the SDLP will abstain  from the vote. In doing so, our actions are consistent with those sentiments.  We do that not to convey opposition to a victims&rsquo; commission per se but to  indicate our lingering doubts about the powers that the victims&rsquo; commission  might have and its role.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Although I do not often agree with Sammy Wilson, there are  times &mdash; if for only a moment &mdash; when I do. I agree that work must be done to  ensure that effective mechanisms are in place to deal with victims&rsquo; issues. On  that theme, I shall make four or five points. The Bill will soon become law,  and it is reasonable to expect that, in those circumstances, individual victims  and groups will knock on the door, or doors, of the victims&rsquo; commission to  advocate on behalf of their individual and broader needs. That is when the  really big issues will emerge.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Over and above the issues that have been rightly and  properly debated in the Chamber over the past few weeks, and over and above the  powers and the moneys that the victims&rsquo; commission will have, issues concerning  the victims&rsquo; commission will endure. The Chamber will not be able to deal with  those issues, and that will lead to individual victims and victims&rsquo; groups having  a level of expectation that will not be fulfilled.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There are three or four reasons for that. On a range of  victims&rsquo; matters, Members are not masters of their own destiny. The British  Government are masters of destiny on such matters; they have established the  law that governs a number of victims&rsquo; issues. That law has been established not  by us, but by the British Government. They have laid down constraints on what  can happen with certain victims. One need only consider how the British  Government have changed tribunal legislation in order to understand how they  will introduce legislation to constrain what a victim or a victim&rsquo;s family can  do. The primary and particular purpose of the Inquiries Act 2005 was to  restrict the Finucane family&rsquo;s ability to get the truth about the murder of the  solicitor Patrick Finucane. The Assembly does not have the power to amend any  or all of that legislation.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, the issue goes deeper than that. As the SDLP  leader, Mark Durkan, said at the weekend, the British Government now propose  legislation that could lead to the establishment of a special-cases coroner.  That legislation may roll out in the North and affect the conduct of inquests  here. As we know from European    Court decisions, dozens of inquests around which  there are serious issues are waiting to be convened. However, the British  Government may be about to legislate in a way in which those inquests will be  constrained in what they can and cannot do.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: On  a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. I seek a ruling. I appreciate that  legislation from Westminster  may lead to serious issues, such as issues around coroners&rsquo; courts and  inquests. However, I struggle to see how the Member is speaking to the Bill.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I ask the Member to stick closely to the Bill.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I appreciate that ruling, Mr Deputy Speaker. A great deal of flexibility has  been shown in the Chamber, and I was exploiting that flexibility.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I move on to matters that affect the Bill, and that  particularly affect the victims&rsquo; commission. The SDLP tabled amendments to the  Bill that were not accepted. If made, those amendments would have incorporated  the Paris Principles into the workings of the victims&rsquo; commission. The Paris  Principles are established UN standards that govern the powers, or otherwise,  of an independent commission to do its business.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">12.30 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We know all about those powers, because when the Assembly  established the position of Children&rsquo;s Commissioner, it legislated for the Paris principles to be  embedded in that post&rsquo;s authority. That enables the Children&rsquo;s Commissioner to  call for papers, summon witnesses and support applicants in matters relating to  their cases.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">From recent history, we know of the long and tedious battle  that was fought with the British Government to ensure that some of the Paris principles were  embedded in the Human Rights Commission&rsquo;s authority. However, the victims&rsquo;  commissioners will not have the power to call for papers, summon witnesses and  subpoena evidence that might come to their attention through a victim or a  victims&rsquo; group. Consequently, in the near future, when people ask the  commission for victims and survivors to act as their voice, the victims&rsquo;  commissioners &mdash; through no fault of their own &mdash; will only be able to reply  that, although they may be those peoples&rsquo; voice, they do not have the power and  authority to act on victims&rsquo; and survivors&rsquo; wishes by compelling witnesses to  appear and by gathering evidence.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">If powers consistent with the Paris principles were good enough for the  Children&rsquo;s Commissioner, the Human Rights Commissioner and other commissions in  the North, the House should stretch itself to provide the same powers for the  commission for victims and survivors, which, through no fault of its own, will  be weaker without them.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Thirdly, many sensitive and important matters have been  rightly addressed in the debate. However, based on my observations, there has  been little discussion about what the commission will actually do. The SDLP wishes  to put down some markers &mdash; not exclusively or exhaustively, but  representatively &mdash; about matters that the commission should address immediately  after the vote.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Through various structures and initiatives, the victims&rsquo;  commissioners should act as voices for victims and survivors. The commission  should provide, as we heard earlier, the fullest possible range of welfare,  financial and broader support for those in need; and, when the Eames/Bradley  recommendations are forthcoming, the commission should be the custodian of, and  responsible for, advancing those recommendations. In future, I hope that  Assembly debates will be concerned with addressing those types of matters,  rather than the other matters that were, rightly, raised in recent weeks.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">My fourth point is about how the Eames/Bradley group will  relate to the commission. If the Assembly is to send any message to the  Northern Ireland people &mdash; especially to those who are still hurting and  grieving &mdash; it should be that every individual deserves the right to the truth about  what happened to their family member or loved one. However, I have not heard  that message coming from the Chamber in a unified voice.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I shall provide two examples. First, in a question for  written answer, I asked:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;the Office of the First Minister and deputy First  Minister to confirm that (i) it will co-operate fully and in all matters with  the Eames/Bradley Consultative Group on the Past and (ii) it will encourage all  groups and individuals to co-operate also.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Given that I asked the First Minister and deputy  First Minister, or the junior Ministers, to address those questions, I wonder  why was the following answer given:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Both of us have met with the Consultative Group in  January 2008. The Consultative Group is to present a report to the Secretary of  State for Northern Ireland  by summer 2008. We therefore have no direct responsibility for, or role in,  this group. We await the outcome of this group.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I asked the shared office of leadership in the  North those simple questions: will it co-operate and will it encourage all  others to co-operate as well? On both matters, the answer was silence.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">What does it say to people in the North and to the victims&rsquo;  commission when the Department that sponsored the Bill is silent when it is  asked a simple question about the principle of co-operation with Eames/Bradley?  Is that the standard that will best inform the victims&rsquo; commission on how to do  its work and inform society as it tries to deal with the difficult issues of  the past?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I have doubts about how the process will work if all  organisations and parties do not co-operate fully with Eames/Bradley or with  any other legitimate inquiry &mdash; police or otherwise &mdash; that is ongoing in the  North. The Bloody Sunday Inquiry revealed that, at the time of the subject of  its investigation, a Member of the House was bound to an illegal organisation  by a code of honour that was greater than the obligation to co-operate and  provide information. I would welcome hearing whether that is still the case.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that we are moving beyond all that. However, in the  day that is in it, given that the McCartney murder trial is due to commence  today, telling the truth and co-operation will be essential in determining  whether there are convictions.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. I ask the Member to restrict his remarks to the Bill.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  The reason for OFMDFM&rsquo;s ambiguous response to a question in the House about  co-operating fully on all matters and encouraging all groups and individuals to  co-operate is &mdash; unfortunately &mdash; still unclear.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior Minister  (Mr Donaldson)</strong>: I thank all Members who contributed to the debate, and I  will respond to some of their remarks. The victims&rsquo; commission that the Bill  will establish is a genuine attempt to do something better for the victims of  the period in Northern Ireland  that has become known as the Troubles and to ensure that they have the support  and recognition that they deserve.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Members may debate whether the proposals in the Bill are  flawed or ineffective, and they are entitled to their view. However, the DUP and  the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister believe that the  proposals are robust and capable of delivering for the innocent victims in Northern Ireland,  the needs of whom are paramount in all discussions about the Bill.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mrs Dolores Kelly said that the powers of the commission  would be ineffective. At one stage, she referred to something that I said about  the Victims and Survivors (Northern    Ireland) Order 2006 in response to points  that her party leader, Mr Durkan, made in the debate during the Bill&rsquo;s  Consideration Stage. I have a copy of the Hansard report of that debate, and,  in fact, I did not accuse Mr Durkan of failing to change the Order &mdash; I know  that an Order cannot be amended once it has been presented and that it can only  be accepted or rejected. The Hansard report is clear that I told Mr Durkan to  re-read the Order because it contains many of the powers about which he spoke.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill deals with the narrow issue of creating the  corporate body that will be known as the victims&rsquo; commission, the powers of  which are already outlined in the Order, even though they were originally meant  for one commissioner. After the interview process and further consideration of  the matter, the First Minister and deputy First Minister felt that the requirements  of the post were so great that it was wrong to put such a heavy burden on the  shoulders of one person. That, in turn, created the need for a commission. That  is why the Bill is before the House and why we are asking Members to support it  &mdash; it is necessary to make progress on the huge amount of work that is required  in the victims and survivors&rsquo; sector.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The commission is only one part of that. A victims&rsquo;  strategy will be introduced shortly, and it will be issued for consultation.  Despite the criticisms that have been made in this House and in this debate,  the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister does not believe  that it has a monopoly on all knowledge and wisdom on these issues. We want to  hear from the people who matter most &mdash; those who have to live daily with the  consequences of being a victim &mdash; and we want them to be involved in shaping the  strategy.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">OFMDFM will also be bringing forward proposals on funding.  Mrs Kelly mentioned the funding of &pound;36 million and suggested that it was simply  old money being recycled; it is regrettable that she said that. It is  unfortunate when Members try to score cheap points on what is a genuine attempt  to ensure that victims&rsquo; groups and individuals get the resources and support  that they need. I say to Mrs Kelly that a lot of this is about healthcare. Of  the proposed &pound;36 million, &pound;19&middot;5 million is new money. Although the remainder  has been allocated to the victims&rsquo; sector, none of it is being taken from the  healthcare budget &mdash; it is new, additional money that is specifically for the  victims&rsquo; sector. I hope that Mrs Kelly will at last recognise that this is a  genuine attempt to provide resources for the victims and survivors&rsquo; sector. It  represents more money than has ever been made available under any previous Administration,  including the one that was headed jointly by Mrs Kelly&rsquo;s party and the Ulster  Unionist Party.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Whatever is being said about the amounts of money involved  and about the intentions behind the establish&shy;ment of the victims&rsquo; commission,  I know and recognise that we &mdash; and I mean all Members &mdash; will be judged on  results and on how effective the commission proves to be over time. This is  about building a partnership with the victims&rsquo; sector to ensure that there is  delivery, not just for the groups who work in the sector but for the individuals  who are not associated with any group &mdash; they are often the people who are  silent and who suffer in silence. Ways must be found to help those people, to identify  their needs and to ensure that those needs are met.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Attwood made similar points to those of Mrs Kelly on the  powers of the commission &mdash; it really depends on what Members want the  commission to do. It will have a role &mdash; but not an exclusive role &mdash; in looking  at the past. Its role will be in partnership with that of the forum, which I  know the SDLP has long called for. The commission will work in partnership with  whatever emerges from the current discussions on how we are going to deal with  the past. We recognise that the commission will have a role to play, but that  it will not be the ultimate authority on how the past is dealt with. The way  forward on that aspect has yet to be worked out.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Ford described the Bill and the process as being flawed.  He said that Sinn F&eacute;in had steamrollered the DUP. I assure Mr Ford that the DUP  has not been steamrollered. I stand here of my own free will, as a Minister,  with the full support of my colleagues, fully supporting this Bill and the  amendments. Indeed, I moved the amendments. No-one steamrollers the DUP. The  DUP has made up its own mind on the issues; as has Sinn F&eacute;in. However, a  responsibility exists within the system that Mr Ford and his party supported at  its establishment &mdash; the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister.  I see Mr Ford shaking his head, but I recollect that he was one of the key  proponents of the &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; campaign and the referendum that supported the  institutions that we have today, albeit, thankfully, updated, improved and  amended since St Andrews.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, those arrangements are transitional, and I forward  look to the day when we can have a proper functioning democratic system in Northern Ireland.</p>

		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  Proper?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Mr Donaldson)</strong>: Yes, Mr McNarry, you supported this system, too.  Your party created this system, and your party is responsible for what we have  today at Stormont, so do not try to walk away from it now and act holier than  thou &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. It is not normally necessary to ask the junior Minister to  address his remarks through the Chair, but I ask him to do so.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Mr Donaldson)</strong>: I am simply responding to points that were made in  the debate, and I will continue to do so. If Members wish to criticise the  process, let them also remember that they fathered the process. They created  the very process of which this Bill is a product, whether they like it or not.  Therefore, we will not take any lectures on hypocrisy, double standards and how  this process works. We are doing the best with what we inherited, and we are  doing our best to make this process work for the people of Northern Ireland.  We are doing our best to clear up the mess that others created in the first  place. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. Allow the Minister to be heard.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Mr Donaldson)</strong>: Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In his remarks, Mr Kennedy described the Bill as a grimy  compromise. He would know all about grimy compromises, because he belongs to a  party, the First Minister of which resigned and then, all of a sudden,  &ldquo;un-resigned&rdquo;. Talk about a grimy compromise.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. You have mentioned several times that  Members must keep to the business at hand. Is there any chance that we could  keep to the business at hand now, rather than be subjected to a history lesson?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I agree that it would be useful to keep to the business at hand.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Mr Donaldson)</strong>: Since Mr McCrea wandered all over the place during  his remarks &mdash; backwards and forwards, inside out and upside down &mdash; I will  listen to no lectures from him about avoiding history lessons. Of course, Mr  McCrea does not have much history when it comes to dealing with the victims of  the Troubles in Northern    Ireland. As I reminded him last week, Mr  McCrea is a ceasefire politician. He put his head above the parapet when the  fighting was over &mdash; when the battle was finished, up popped Mr McCrea. He may  well have won the BBC &lsquo;Politics Show&rsquo; newcomer of the year award, but, as far  as we are concerned, he is the latecomer of the year when it comes to dealing  with the victims of violence.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">My party has been dealing with this issue for years, and it  will continue to deal with it, because it puts the victims first. It is our  party that is bringing forward this Bill. It is the Office of the First  Minister and deputy First Minister that is delivering for victims, where others  failed to do so when they held those positions. They failed, and miserably so.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I recall that, when I was a member of the Ulster Unionist  Party, I presented the then First Minister and leader of the party, David  Trimble, with a paper on the need for a victims&rsquo; commission. That paper was  ignored, and Mr Trimble and the Ulster Unionist Party failed to deliver for the  victims. Therefore, we will take no lectures from Mr Kennedy or Mr McCrea,  because their record of dealing with this issue is, frankly, lamentable &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  Join the Provos.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Mr Kennedy, I ask you to withdraw that remark.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  The remark is withdrawn.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Mr Donaldson)</strong>: Thank you very much, Mr Deputy Speaker. I remind  Mr Kennedy that I put on the uniform of the Crown to fight the Provos, and that members of my family died in  that fight. I am glad that we are in a better place today and that we have a  relative degree of peace and stability. There was a dreadful incident last  night in Tyrone, and we all pray that that young man &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I regret that Mr Kennedy seems to want to interrupt my  condemnation of acts of violence. Does he not at least have the decency to  allow me to condemn an act of violence without interrupting me? We all condemn  last night&rsquo;s act of violence, and we do not want any more victims to be created  in Northern Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  You have lost the plot, Jeffrey.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Mr Donaldson)</strong>: I have not lost the plot, Mr McNarry. The people  who lost the plot in 1998 were the people who voted to open the gates of the  Maze Prison and let the murderers out on to the streets. Do not lecture me  about losing the plot. The people who lost the plot &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order, please. I honestly believe that this has gone too far. We  are not talking to the Bill at all, and that is to be highly regretted.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Mr Donaldson)</strong>: I take your point, Mr Deputy Speaker, but I note  that the continuous interruptions and interventions from a sedentary position  go unchecked, and, therefore, somebody has to deal with them.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: If you check the Hansard report tomorrow, I think that you will  see that I have had to intervene a record number of times.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Mr Donaldson)</strong>: Well, Mr Deputy Speaker, I have been interrupted  on a number of occasions, and it has been me who has been asked to come to  order, not others.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. Is it not the case that, when the  junior Minister speaks, he is speaking on behalf of OFMDFM, and not on behalf  of the DUP or, indeed, himself?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the junior Minister please continue?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Mr Donaldson)</strong>: I would not be a junior Minister if I were not a  member of the Democratic Unionist Party &mdash; and I do not divorce myself from my  party, except when it goes the wrong way. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There is much more that I could say about the contributions  that were made &mdash; some of which, quite frankly, are unworthy of comment. Mr  Basil McCrea spoke of a cosy coalition. May I remind the Member that the Ulster  Unionist Party is part of the coalition Government in Northern Ireland  &mdash; a coalition Government that it helped to design. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. Will Members please allow the Minister to speak?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Mr Donaldson)</strong>: The reality is that I am working in a joint office  that was created by the Ulster Unionist Party, the SDLP and others. We do our  best to try to reach a consensus on very difficult issues, and I regret that we  were not able to achieve a broader consensus in this Chamber on these issues. I  assure Members that that was our objective in the amendments that we tabled,  which were designed to address concerns that Members had raised, and to do so  in a way that enabled us to move this legislation forward with the broadest  possible consensus.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the fact that the Ulster Unionist Party has  indicated that it will vote for the Bill; the SDLP will abstain; and I am not  sure about the Alliance Party, which, I believe, indicated that it will vote  against the Bill at this Stage. We have achieved at least some degree of  consensus, even if it is not the broadest possible.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">What matters now is to ensure that the commission can  deliver for the victims of violence. However, this House, too, has a continuing  role in addressing the needs and concerns of victims, as have the Executive,  the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister, and other  Ministers.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">This has, at times, been a heated debate, but I recognise  that this is an emotive issue that goes to the heart of where we have come from  and how we deal with the past. I accept Mr Attwood&rsquo;s points. I say to him, in  relation to the Eames/Bradley process, that my party will co-operate fully, as  it has done. We have met the Eames/Bradley Consultative Group on the Past on  several occasions. I understand that Sinn F&eacute;in has also had a number of  meetings with the group.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">What the First Minister and deputy First Minister cannot do  at this stage is pre-empt the outcome of the group&rsquo;s report. We must wait for  its recommendation and consider where we stand on them. The Eames/Bradley  Consultative Group on the Past was established not by this House, not by the  Executive, but by the Northern Ireland Office, and is, to a certain extent  therefore, outwith the devolution process. Therefore, we have to see where that  process goes in order to determine the role of the First Minister and deputy  First Minister, and their Department, when it comes to implementing the group&rsquo;s  recommendations.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I did not suggest that the junior Minister&rsquo;s Office should pre-empt the  findings of the Eames/Bradley group. I asked the Office of the First Minister  and deputy First Minister, in a question for written answer, AQW 4703/08:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;to confirm that (i) it will co-operate fully and in  all matters with the Eames/Bradley Consultative Group on the Past and (ii) it  will encourage all groups and individuals to co-operate also&rdquo;.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">There was silence in reply.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I was trying to probe whether that silence endured or  whether Mr Donaldson&rsquo;s party, as opposed to OFMDFM, would now co-operate fully  with the Eames/Bradley group. People are encouraged to co-operate with inquiries  into criminal activity; there&shy;fore, does he not agree that it would be helpful  if his party were to send out a clear message to the people by co-operating  with the Eames/Bradley Consultative Group on the Past, without fear, favour or  prejudice?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Mr Donaldson)</strong>: We are already doing that. I have nothing further  to add on what we are already doing.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Committee for the Office of the First Minister  and deputy First Minister for its involvement in the process. There were  problems because some Committee members were opposed to accelerated passage and  would have preferred a full Committee Stage. However, we have now reached the  stage where it is to be hoped that the Bill will be passed by the House and  enacted as law. That will enable the commission to get on with its work.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We support the commission in its work. Members stated  clearly that they will assist the commission, and that is important. We all  represent constituencies in which there are victims and survivors, and people  who are living with the legacy of more than three decades of violence. Dolores  Kelly said that victims&rsquo; interests remain prejudiced by a lack of consensus and  failure of leadership. We may not have achieved the level of consensus that we  would like, but at least we can now go forward, showing leadership.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that we can end this debate on a positive note.  Despite our differences about whether the commission is adequate, we should all  resolve to do our best to make it work for the good of the people who need its  help. It is to be hoped that the commission, the strategy and the other work  that is yet to be done will deliver for those who have waited for a long time.</p>

		    <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="4"></a>Private Members&rsquo; Business</p>
		    <p class="H4StageHeading">Post-Primary Transfer</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to two hours for the  debate. The proposer of the motion will have 10 minutes in which to propose,  and 10 minutes in which to make a winding-up speech. All other Members who are  called to speak will have five minutes.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Three amendments have been selected and published on the Marshalled  List. The proposer of each amendment will have 10 minutes in which to propose,  and five minutes in which to make a winding-up speech.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly, given high levels of public concern,  calls on the Executive to create a Ministerial Sub-Committee to recommend  appropriate regulations to govern post-primary transfer from 2010.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">From the outset, I wish to explicitly outline that  the motion is not about the policy options on post-primary transfer that the  Minister of Education is pursuing. It is not about determining which system  replaces the 11-plus, nor is it about the Minister&rsquo;s belief that academic  selection must be abandoned. It is about establishing a process to resolve a  contentious issue.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Debates on the subject of matching pupils with appropriate  post-primary schools take place throughout the United Kingdom and in many other  jurisdictions &mdash; it is a normal part of politics. Such debate is good and  healthy, and clarifies how proposals will progress. However, debate is not a  substitute for action &mdash; that is the problem with the Assembly&rsquo;s current  position.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">On 9 May 2007, within two days of the Minister&rsquo;s taking  office, she said:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Over the coming months we will need to address major  issues such as academic selection&rdquo;.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The months passed until, in December 2007, seven  months after the Minister&rsquo;s pledge to address major issues, the House received  a vague outline &mdash; and &ldquo;outline&rdquo; is the word that the Minister used &mdash; with no  substantive proposals for the future. Almost one year to the day later, there  are still no proposals. Loyal members of the Minister&rsquo;s party &mdash; who are massed  on the Benches, ready to retaliate &mdash; will, undoubtedly, inform the House that  an announcement is imminent. Stand by your beds &mdash; all will be revealed shortly.  The trouble with that is that it is all too late.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Few Members would be surprised if the Minister did not  cobble something together at this late stage &mdash; almost anything in fact, to get  us out of this debacle. It would not be a surprise if the Minister suddenly,  and against all previous protestations, were to discover that the Council for  the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment (CCEA) was capable of and willing  to accommodate some form of academic criteria and would be able to formulate an  acceptable transfer test. It would not be a surprise if the Minister decided  after all that academic criteria, rather than being some form of inherent evil  to be eradicated in 2010, could be allowed to continue for a period of  transition. Frankly, there is no other way out of this mess.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It would not be a surprise, if having made that decision  and wasted a year, the Minister suddenly decided that legislation would have to  be pushed through by way of accelerated passage. If we are guessing correctly,  that would be a tragedy &mdash; it would be a sad state of affairs for schoolchildren  and their parents across Northern    Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Bearing in mind all that has happened, it is no surprise that  a recent poll in &lsquo;The Irish News&rsquo; revealed that 93&middot;3% of school principals did  not obtain sufficient information from the Minister of Education to allow them  to formulate their plans. That is an incredible figure &mdash; nine out of 10  principals. All the primary school principals whom I met during a recent visit  to Cookstown told me of their worries about that lack of information.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">If the Minister has failed the schools and their  principals, she has also failed parents. A &lsquo;Belfast Telegraph&rsquo; poll revealed  that only 22% of parents had confidence in the Minister&rsquo;s ability to deliver  policies in time that would suit them. A full two thirds &mdash; 66% &mdash; of parents of  children in the age group that was most likely to be affected said that they  did not understand the Minister&rsquo;s plans. Therefore, there is no understanding  about what will happen in the very near future.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Parents have the primary responsibility for guiding their  children through education. Ironically, the Minister told us in the statement  that she made in the House on 4 December 2007 that parental guidance would play  a significant role in any new arrangements. How can parental guidance be used  if no one knows what the framework is? How can anyone be guided if they do not  know where they are going?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The clock is ticking. It has been one year since the  restoration of devolution. There is only one academic year to go, but the  Minister has failed to provide the clarity that is necessary for parents to  play their proper role in the education system. The figures that I quoted demonstrate  unequivocally that the Minister of Education has completely lost the trust of  two key groups &mdash; parents and principals. The competence of the Minister is  being questioned not only in this House and in the Committee for Education, but  throughout our entire society. In any other jurisdiction that would be cause  for concern, but, apparently, that is not the case here.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister said that she has been seeking consensus. Let  me tell her, Mr Deputy Speaker, that she has achieved it. Everyone across  society and across the education stakeholders agrees. Irrespective of their  views on academic selection or post-primary transfer, people believe that the  Minister is failing our children, their parents and their schools.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Perhaps the greatest indication of the abject failure of  Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s Minister of Education is that she pledged to destroy academic  selection, but is now presiding over independent academic selection in several  academic schools. That happened on the Minister&rsquo;s watch, but it did not have to  happen. The principals of the post-primary schools that are involved in the  move towards independent academic selection have done so with the utmost  reluctance. One of them said that they had been:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;forced down this road due to the lack of movement and  lack of information from the minister&hellip;I cannot emphasise enough that this is  not the way we want to go but we feel we are left with no option because of a  lack of information and the intransigence of the minister&rdquo;.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Let me state clearly that I, and others, have previously  spoken on the record about the issue. No-one wants independent entrance tests;  they are a measure of last resort. However, the Minister has created that  situation, the irony of which cannot be missed. The Minister has condemned the  entrance-test plan as &ldquo;elitist&rdquo;, but it has happened on her watch; she is  responsible for the emergence of independent transfer tests.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Like every Minister in the Executive, the Minister of  Education has taken the Pledge of Office, which includes the obligation to  serve all the people of Northern    Ireland. Therefore, a Minister is not a mere  spokesman for a political party. She or he has a solemn responsibility to put Northern Ireland  first &mdash; ahead of his or her party. However, since the restoration of  devolution, we have witnessed a Minister of Education acting as though her role  was no more than that of spokesman for Sinn F&eacute;in following an exclusively Sinn  F&eacute;in agenda.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Northern    Ireland deserves better. The children,  parents, teachers and schools of Northern Ireland deserve better.  They deserve an Education Minister who will not allow her party political  agenda always to trump her wider obligations and responsibilities.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">An Executive subcommittee is merely a mechanism for  ensuring that the Education Minister delivers on her wider obligations and  responsibilities. I should be happy to hear of any other channels through which  that might be done. It is telling that the Minister views the Executive  subcommittee as a threat. Time and again we have asked her to bring her  proposals for discussion. It is not as though that is abnormal. Executive  subcommittees are routinely used to address significant issues that require  political consensus. That is why they were used for the review of public  administration and for Planning Policy Statement 14 (PPS 14). They are a  perfectly normal way of dealing with such matters.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Using an Executive subcommittee would have several  benefits. First, it would instil public confidence in a vital area of education  policy, demonstrating that the Executive are determined to chart collectively a  way forward that will have maximum cross-community support. Secondly, it would  erase the impression that a narrow partisan agenda is intent on provoking  discord and educational chaos. Thirdly, it would show that the Minister of  Education has given up destructive solo runs, abandoned her hostility towards  those who dare to disagree with her, and finally accepted that children and  parents must come first, rather than her narrow partisan agenda. I urge Members  to support the motion.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  I beg to move amendment No 1: Leave out all after &ldquo;Assembly&rdquo; and insert</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;notes that the Minister of Education is to present  proposals on post-primary transfer to the Executive on Thursday 15th May and  agrees to await the outcome of those discussions.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Sinn F&eacute;in has  proposed this amendment because, despite what Basil McCrea has said, it is not  too late for the Minister to put forward proposals. Given that Caitr&iacute;ona Ruane,  the Minister of Education, plans to attend the Executive on Thursday to share  her proposals on the way forward for transfer, the motion is basically  outdated, and there is no reason for it.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not agree with Basil that the Minister&rsquo;s action is too  late. She has gone through the process; she set out her vision and went through  intensive negotiations and discussions with education stakeholders. As a result  of that consultation, we have arrived where we are today, and the Minister  intends to present her proposals to the Executive and, shortly afterwards, to  the Committee for Education.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion detracts from the real debate. Instead of  discussing the ins and outs of the post-primary debate, we are dealing again  with the political games of the UUP, which simply does not agree with the  direction in which the Minister is going. The Minister&rsquo;s proposals will become  clear, are visionary and will ensure that all of our kids have the best  educational future and the best outcomes, whether of an academic or vocational  nature. Sinn F&eacute;in recognises academic excellence, but it recognises equally  that some children are more suited to vocational education. Let us not let  those children down or deem them lower achievers as they travel down their  paths.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It appears that the UUP wants to bypass the normal democratic  process by setting up the ministerial subcom&shy;mittee. One clear fact seems to be  missing: Caitr&iacute;ona Ruane is the Minister of Education and has responsibility  for introducing and setting policy on education.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">UUP Members may not like that situation, and have therefore  tried through the motion to weaken the position and powers of the Minister by  establishing a subcommittee to bring forward regulations. However, all parties  in the Chamber need to be mindful of the implications. Do they want to set a  precedent on taking control away from Ministers by establishing, on a  willy-nilly basis, groups that will take decisions out of Ministers&rsquo; hands?</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  The intention is not to take anything out of Ministers&rsquo; hands. This is a tried  and tested method within the Executive for resolving difficult issues. Arlene  Foster used it in respect of the review of public administration. Indeed, as  far as the Education Minister is concerned, her colleague, Conor Murphy, also  used it in relation to water charges. This is not a case of trying to undermine  anyone; it is simply a case of trying to find a more acceptable way of bringing  things forward.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  I have no problem with subcommittees being set up on cross-departmental issues;  however, this issue relates purely to education.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The consequence of agreeing to the motion will be to take  power away from Ministers. If the Members who proposed the motion were logical  thinkers, they would accept amendment No 1, because that would send a message  to the electorate that they are not playing games with the issue.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">On Thursday, when the Executive considers the Minister&rsquo;s  proposals, I hope that we will move to the final stage in transforming the  education system so that all children and young people are treated equally and  given every support to succeed.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  I beg to move amendment No 2: Leave out all after &ldquo;Assembly&rdquo; and insert</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;regrets the delay in decision-making on post-primary  educational reform and the resulting high levels of public concern and damage  to public confidence; and calls on the Minister of Education to publish  forthwith her proposals on Transfer, Sustainable   Schools and Area-based  planning.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister has told us that changes in education have to  be managed carefully. One way of doing so would be by providing people with  clear information about the changes planned. When people know how change will  be achieved, and the logical steps taking them to that point, they know where  they are going. However, when people are kept in the dark and are denied  information, or have information drip-fed to them, they naturally become  anxious and begin to lose faith in reform. That is exactly what has happened in  the case of education reform. There has been a dearth of information, detail  has not been forthcoming and the public have lost faith.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">More importantly, parents have lost faith: they are  wondering what lies in store for the children who are in primary 5. Teachers  have lost faith because they have not been in a position to answer the  questions that parents ask them day and daily at the school gate. Sadly, that  anxiety has filtered through to the pupils themselves.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Because of the information vacuum in which change is being  implemented &mdash; or not implemented &mdash; the situation is being described,  understandably, as a mess. The Minister has told us time and again that she has  consulted with key stakeholders. However, the key stakeholders in this process  are the parents who do not know what lies in store for their children &mdash;  particularly the parents of the first cohort, the primary-5 children.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Supporters of reform have been bewildered by the way in  which the process has been managed, and they can see clearly that reform has  been undermined as a result. The history of the process has been that the  Minister has only been forthcoming with information when the Assembly was  demanded to know what was happening.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">One wonders what the Minister&rsquo;s plan was. It was certainly  not to keep everyone informed with the maximum amount of information during  every step in the process. Why has that been the case? I see no strategic  advantage in the Minister&rsquo;s approach. It has not convinced the opponents of  reform and has only served to weaken whatever consensus existed already around  transfer at age 14. It looks very much like the Minister is making things up as  she goes along, and she cannot provide answers because she does not have them  herself.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">At this late stage, as we face another school year, major  policy areas have not been clarified. The effects on local people on the ground  following the ending of the transfer test will not be known for a considerable  time because key policies are not yet in place.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In the emerging situation, the future of transfer is  inextricably linked to area-based planning, and area-based planning is  inextricably linked to the sustainable-schools policy.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, we still do not have clear guidelines on those  policies. When will we have those? Will the drip feed of information continue,  creating more uncertainty and anxiety among parents and pupils?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">On Tuesday 4 March, the Minister informed the Assembly that  she was implementing processes and structures to take forward an area-based  approach to post-primary provision &mdash; area-based planning. However, two months  later, no significant detail is available. We have not yet seen the terms of  reference or the guidelines for area-based planning, even though consultation  is to be complete by 9 January. One wonders whether that target date can be  met, given the fact that the local groups have not yet been established as we  approach the end of another school year.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">If previous experience is anything to go by, even after  consultation has ended, we will have to wait for the Minister&rsquo;s response. That  response will probably come some time afterwards, and very late for parents to  grapple with as they attempt to choose schools for the first cohort of children  to transfer without academic selection.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There are many questions about area-based planning and  sustainable schools that must be answered. The Minister is due to present a  paper to the Executive on Thursday of this week. I believe that that paper is  already in the hands of the press, before the Executive and Members of the  House have seen it. I do not know what is in that paper but &mdash; for the sake of  parents, teachers and members of the education community &mdash; I hope that it will  contain the required detail on the areas of policy that I have outlined.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I appreciate the concerns of those who have proposed both  the substantive motion and the Alliance Party amendment. However, I do not  agree that the creation of an Executive subcommittee is the best way to deal  with those concerns. The Minister is responsible for education, and our job, as  Members of the Assembly, is to hold the Minister to account. We must ensure  that she provides parents and teachers with the information on key policy areas  that they require. To kick this issue into Executive touch would free the  Minister of account&shy;ability, and allow her to hide under the skirts of an  Executive subcommittee.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">My amendment seeks to hold the Minister to account and to  force her to face up to her responsibilities to parents, pupils and teachers. I  ask Members to support my amendment. Ending the current transfer system affects  &mdash; and is of concern to &mdash; people on the ground. We have still not seen the terms  of reference for key policies. Even after the end of consultation, we will  probably have to wait for clarity on those policies. I ask the Members to  support amendment No 2. Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>: I  beg to move amendment No 3: At end insert</p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion">&lsquo;, in the event that the Minister fails to bring forward  detailed proposals for full consideration by the Assembly.&rsquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The motion raises an important issue in its mention  of &ldquo;public concern&rdquo;. Obviously, there is considerable public concern about what  the Minister views as the way forward. The Minister&rsquo;s proposals must be  carefully thought out and capable of implementation. We reluctantly accept the  Minister&rsquo;s explanation for the long delay as she consulted with every  interested stakeholder in the education sector. However, perhaps, enough is  enough. As we know, the Minister will bring her proposals to the Executive in  two days&rsquo; time. Therefore, the timing of the motion is unfortunate. The motion  would have had more relevance if it had been introduced some weeks or months  ago.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The unionist parties have used every opportunity to put  pressure on the Minister. The proposal of this motion is another novel way of  bringing this matter before the House. However, surely they recognise, deep in  their hearts, that the Executive will not create another subcommittee for the  purpose demanded by the motion &mdash; if for no other reason than it would allow the  Minister to get away with not doing her job.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, the amendment is impossible to implement  without the Minister&rsquo;s consent, and there is little chance that that will be  forthcoming. The motion asks for the impossible, and it serves no purpose,  except as an expression of frustration and righteous anger from the Ulster  Unionist Benches. Basil McCrea was eight minutes and 40 seconds into his speech  before he even mentioned the Executive subcommittee &mdash; until then, his speech  was merely just such an expression.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Alliance Party takes a more moderate approach. The  delay has been frustrating for us as well, but how much more frustrating has it  been for the pupils, parents and teachers whose interests should be at the  centre of the debate? They deserve to know what is proposed, as 2010 comes ever  closer.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The reason why the Alliance Party tabled the amendment may  be found in the Sinn F&eacute;in document which came to light some weeks ago, and  which raised concerns that the Minister might be considering an approach  designed to bypass the Assembly. I do not know whether such a tactic is  possible. I look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s comments on that matter, and I hope  for her reassurance that that idea has been discounted.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There is only one means of agreeing the way forward: it is  absolutely paramount that, whatever the proposals are, they are laid before the  Assembly for full scrutiny. Any attempt to avoid full debate &mdash; including a  request for accelerated passage &mdash; is unacceptable and will not succeed.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Our motion sets no timescale, but the end of June marks the  absolute time limit for action. I welcome the fact that the Minster will brief  her Executive colleagues this week, and I look forward to her presenting the  same proposals, very quickly afterwards, to the Assembly. If the Minister does  that, she will prove that there is nowhere to hide for those who pretend that  there is no need for change, no need for equality or no means of progress. If  she fails to do that, it will appear that she is the one with something to  hide. She must realise that.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I will comment briefly on the other two amendments. First,  I shall address the amendment standing in the name of Michelle O&rsquo;Neill. Mr  Deputy Speaker, I have no wish to question your decision on this matter, but we  have before us an amendment that removes all but the first three words of a  motion, and effectively replaces the original motion with another. Having said  that, the proposal that we should patiently await the outcome of the  Executive&rsquo;s discussions holds no appeal for my party. We have been patient long  enough. The amendment is irrelevant to the original motion.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The amendment in the name of Mr and Mrs Bradley &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That amendment totally changes the meaning of the  original motion, and merely calls on the Minister to publish her proposals  &ldquo;forthwith&rdquo;. We all want that to happen; we do not need to debate that  proposal.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Our amendment seeks assurance from the Minister that full  debate in the House will be facilitated. Such an assurance will be warmly  welcomed by the Alliance Party. I could quote Winston Churchill, who famously  referred to &ldquo;the end of the beginning&rdquo; and &ldquo;the beginning of the end&rdquo;. I hope  that, whatever happens to this motion &mdash; which is not all that relevant &mdash; the  Minister&rsquo;s expected announcement will mark the beginning of the end of this  process, and that we will achieve what we all want: a modern, fair, education  system that is fit for purpose, relevant to the modern world and the needs of  the community, and something of which we can be proud. If that can be brought  about, all this will have been worthwhile.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We are seeking action and reassurance from the Minister  about the post-primary process, and we want it no later than the end of June.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  I could use the debate for political knockabout, to which I know the Minister  would immediately respond. She would get mad and jump up and down, and we could  have a bit of fun with her. There is plenty of material: recent polls in the  newspapers show that she is perceived as the worst-performing Minister, and  there is a rich vein of imagery that could be tapped. It could be alleged that  she and I are the Jack and Vera Duckworth of the Assembly. I could draw many  parallels between the hectoring, lecturing, hen-pecking Vera &mdash; who has been  written out of the script &mdash; but I am not going to do that.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As other Members have said, this issue is one that we need  to address, and address seriously.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">2.30 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I have three things to say to the Minister. First, it has  become obvious from opinion polls and other sources that although, by virtue of  her position, she has the first degree of control on this issue, it is an issue  on which this Assembly is going to be judged. It is significant that when, on  the first birthday of this Assembly, people were making adverse comments, the  one area that they zoned in on time and time again was education. Although that  may be regarded as something of an accusation against the Minister,  nevertheless the Assembly itself will suffer if it is not addressed. That is  why it is imperative that all of us put pressure on the Minister to move in the  right direction.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">My second point is that there is need for agreement with  other parties. The Assembly heard a debate earlier today on the victims&rsquo;  commission, and we have previously heard debates about the RPA, councils, the  Budget and a whole range of other issues. The one thing that strikes me about  all those debates was that we had Ministers who were willing to engage with  other parties; there has been the ability to reach agreement.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am aware that the Minister and I are poles apart  ideologically on this matter. The Minister wants a system based on economic and  social selection, whereas I want a system based on educational merit and  ability. Despite this, we must find a way of reaching an agree&shy;ment. My  position on academic selection has been copper-fastened in the St Andrews  Agreement. As a result of that agreement, those schools that wish to retain  academic selection will have the opportunity to do so and to apply it as they  see fit. However, I would much prefer that we had a system, agreed to by the  entire Assembly, that regularises in law whatever the transfer arrangements are  going to be. That is something towards which we must work.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Reference has been made today to the Minister&rsquo;s proposals.  There are some things there on which we can work together, but, equally, the  Minister has to give cognisance to those of us who believe that schools that  wish to remain as specialist academic schools should have the ability to choose  youngsters who best suit what they have to offer.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">My third point relates to the motion put forward by Basil  McCrea. This motion is not an attempt to snatch away responsibility from the  Minister and give it to somebody else. Ministerial subcommittees have been  tried previously on difficult issues in this Assembly and have succeeded.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Notwithstanding Michelle O&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s response to my  intervention, this is a good example of a policy that would fit into the  Executive Committee, because it is cross-cutting &mdash; it affects the Departments  of Finance and Personnel, Employment and Learning, and Education. Therefore,  there are good grounds for taking a cross-party and cross-ministerial approach  on this to reach agreement. It is quite clear that, after one year in office,  the Minister has not been capable by herself of reaching agreement and bringing  forward a proposal.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. The Member&rsquo;s time is up, and he can go back to the Rover&rsquo;s  Return.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Miss McIlveen</strong>:  It is perhaps worthy of mention that Sinn F&eacute;in is reshuffling its Education  Committee members. Wednesday O&rsquo;Neill remains, but Pugsley Butler has been  deemed not naughty enough, and so the Adams  family has now drafted in good old faithful Lurch in an attempt to disguise his  Minister&rsquo;s failings while she tries to prune the bloom of our education system.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Given the growing frequency of the Member for Upper Bann&rsquo;s  contributions during education debates and his predecessor&rsquo;s inability to  adequately defend the indefensible actions of his Minister &mdash; although he must  be applauded for giving it a go &mdash; it comes as no surprise that he is joining  the Committee for Education.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I congratulate the Ulster Unionist Party for tabling the  motion. It clearly got the idea from a DUP Minister who suggested it at an  Executive meeting. Since the Ulster Unionist Party is promoting DUP proposals,  I have no hesitation in supporting the motion.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I have concerns, however, about the amendments, particularly  those tabled by Sinn F&eacute;in and the SDLP. It is clear that the Minister is  incapable of bringing the situation regarding post-primary transfer to a  conclusion by herself. I appreciate the spirit in which the Alliance Party&rsquo;s  amendment was tabled, but it does not provide a definitive timescale. It will,  therefore, allow the Minister to wangle her way out of a difficult situation.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is apparent to me and, undoubtedly, to others in the  Chamber and to the many dozens of constituents, teachers and parents that I  have spoken to in the past year, that the Minister is hopelessly out of her  depth. Sinn F&eacute;in is faced with a terrible dilemma: lose face by replacing her,  or lose support by keeping her. If it were not for the damage that she is doing  to the confidence of teachers and parents, and the waste of resources that she  funnels into her pet projects, I would tell them to keep her in position.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Some 90% of the schools surveyed by &lsquo;The Irish News&rsquo; said  that they did not have enough information from the Minister on the future of  education in Northern Ireland post-11, so it is obvious that the Minister has  lost the confidence of teachers. Only 24 out of 90 principals said that they  had confidence in her. I am surprised that the figure was as high as 24, since  most of them felt that they were being kept in the dark. Perhaps they enjoy the  Minister&rsquo;s mushroom-farming approach to education reform. Only one quarter of  primary school principals thought that a workable system would be put in place  &mdash; that is hardly a ringing endorsement.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We are six months away from the final 11-plus test, but we  are no clearer on what the Minister wants to put in its place. Confusion  abounds. The Minister tells us about the wonderful public meetings that she  attends, at which everyone tells her what a great job she is doing. They do not  sound anything like the public meetings that I have attended. Perhaps she is  sitting with an iPod and listening to her own reassurances on some kind of  loop.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Parents, teachers and primary 5 pupils do not know what is  happening. It is fortunate that a significant proportion of grammar schools has  stepped up to the mark and taken advantage of the opportunity afforded to them  by the DUP at St Andrews by proposing a new common entrants test. It is not an  ideal situation or a perfect solution, but, in the absence of anything coming  from the Minister, it is the best option on the table.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In response to that proposal, the Minister goes on the  attack. First, she says that she will not fund the test; subsequently, she says  that the schools cannot use departmental funds to defend any appeals; and,  finally, she calls those schools elitist. That is no way to win friends and  influence people. Of course, there must be one grammar school in Newry that is  not elitist.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The longer that the Minister dithers and fails to achieve  any form of agreement, the more she chooses to ignore the role of the Committee  for Education. As uncertainty continues to grow, more schools will opt to set  entrance exams, and the Minister may find that the decision taken by Lumen  Christi is merely the tip of a large Catholic-maintained-sector iceberg.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We need action now and solid proposals that can be  discussed. The Minister is unable to deliver consensus, and the best way of  achieving that is by establishing a ministerial subcommittee.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: For a while, I thought that I was going to be referred to as  Thing. Speaking of whom, I call Mr Storey.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>: I  would not refer to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, in such a derogatory fashion; others  might, but I would not.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Yet again, the motion being debated puts the Minister of  Education at the crossroads. There is a sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu; we have been here so  many times, and the same arguments have been repeated many times, but,  unfortunately, we still get the same response from the Minister. She does not  listen, and she is not interested in taking notes when Members are speaking so  that she can give a comprehensive, detailed response to what is being said. No  doubt the Minister will again read from the prepared script, and there will be  no deviation from that. That is how it goes with this Minister.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">At the heart of the debate is the belief that time has run  out for Caitr&iacute;ona Ruane after months of her prevaricating on the future of  post-primary selection. That is why I have some difficulties with the Alliance  Party&rsquo;s amendment, which could be viewed as letting the Minister off the hook.  I assure Members that that is the last thing that Members on this side of the  House want to do, and I think that that is the general consensus in the  Chamber. I suspect that it is probably the general consensus in her own party.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It has been one year since the restoration of devolution,  and Caitr&iacute;ona Ruane&rsquo;s scorecard does not read well. We have had a full year of  her dithering, stalling, lecturing us about clarity, consultation and equality  of opportunity, and making changes and revisions. The Minister has failed to  impress because she has failed to lead and failed to convince anyone &mdash; even  those in her own party &mdash; that she has the ability to lead. The recent poll in  the &lsquo;Belfast Telegraph&rsquo; clearly showed that 64% of Sinn F&eacute;in supporters believe  that there should be some form of academic selection. The Minister will try to  dismiss that and argue about it, but statistics can be very stubborn, and that  statistic is one that she should not ignore.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">My colleague Michelle McIlveen referred to the Sinn F&eacute;in  reshuffle. That reshuffle was all about trying to save face for Caitr&iacute;ona Ruane  and trying to spare her any embarrassment. We welcome Mr O&rsquo;Dowd, the former  chef, to the education kitchen. No doubt his party thinks that he can prepare a  new menu that will be more palatable for us, but, alas, he will still be using  the same ingredients, which will not include academic selection.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>:  Does the Member agree that that kitchen would be in grave danger of being  closed down by environmental health for using those ingredients?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>: I  thank the Member for his intervention; I was going to go on to say that that  meal would have to carry a health warning, and it certainly would not be  supported by Jamie Oliver, who would come to the conclusion that it was a  recipe for disaster. As the saying goes, you can rearrange the deckchairs on  the Titanic, but it will still go down. That can be applied to what is, in this  case, the wrong policy.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in has tried to give us all sorts of reasons to  explain why Paul Butler has been sidelined and John O&rsquo;Dowd has been brought in.  We know that that is because Sinn F&eacute;in is divided on the issue, and the results  of the &lsquo;Belfast Telegraph&rsquo; poll indicate clearly that Sinn F&eacute;in does not have  the support of its own community.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is probably an insult to Basil McCrea&rsquo;s ego that Sinn  F&eacute;in has brought in someone who has more of an insight into education than he  does. When one listens to Basil, one would think that he was the fountain of all  knowledge when it comes to these issues. Obviously, there will be a bit of a  contest the first time that those Members meet in the Committee for Education,  and we look forward to that battle.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">My advice to the Minister is very simple and very clear: if  she cannot stand the heat, she should take off her head chef&rsquo;s hat and get out  of the kitchen. Doing so would be a service to education. Everyone knows that  the Minister is opposed to the 11-plus, but no one knows what is she is  prepared to put in its place. Reference has been made to the consultation that  the DUP has undertaken on this issue &mdash; we have gone out to the country and have  approached parents, school teachers and boards of governors. No one who has  come to those well-attended public meetings has told us that the Minister is on  the right course. But that is nothing new, because Sinn &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. The egg timer has run its course, and the Member&rsquo;s time is  up.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>: I  support the motion.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I  declare an interest as a governor of Glynn   Primary School, where I  and other governors work in a voluntary capacity to further the interests of  the children, teachers and the school generally. It is important that our focal  point in this debate should be the pupils who will be affected, their parents,  those who work in the teaching community, and the turmoil that they currently  face.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is regrettable that, despite one year having passed  since the restoration of devolution, no firm proposals about the future of  post-primary education have been brought to the Assembly, or, for that matter,  to the Committee for Education.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">A child&rsquo;s education is precious, and it is so for his or  her parents. The degree of concern that exists is unsurprising. I &mdash; like all  other Members, I suspect &mdash; have been approached by parents who, because of the current  void, are concerned about their children&rsquo;s futures.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As my colleagues highlighted, the Minister of Education has  repeatedly delayed publishing definitive proposals about the future of  post-primary education. Instead, we have been told of vague visions that  contained very little detail. The Minister has often said that, over the coming  months, she will take various actions. However, to date, nothing has happened.  Time and patience have run out.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As other Members said, the public&rsquo;s concern has been  evident through the media, including in editorials, letters pages, opinion  pieces and radio phone-ins. It is important that action is taken.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister should be reminded that it is not simply a  matter of her issuing a statement; the Assembly&rsquo;s cross-community support for  legislation is required. To date, little attempt has been made to garner the  support that may enable the passage of such legislation.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As I said earlier, education is vital to every child&rsquo;s  future, but it is also vital to the future of the Northern Ireland economy.  Therefore, the issue affects not only individual children, but the long-term  future of citizens in Northern    Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As I said, no serious attempt has been made to secure  widespread support. Given that the Minister has a difficult relationship with the  Committee for Education, a ministerial subcommittee would be a suitable forum  in which to discuss the problems with post-primary education, reach some form  of consensus and find a constructive solution.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Some Members are of the view that such a subcommittee is  not required. I remind them that many ministerial subcommittees have been  created over the past year to consider various issues, including domestic and  sexual violence, children and young people, flooding incidents in 2007, a  review of water and sewerage, the RPA, and PPS 14.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is nonsense to say that post-primary education is not a  cross-cutting issue. It is clear that interaction with DEL is required. Furthermore, given the  impact that education has on the economy, DETI should also be involved. As  others said, a huge financial cost is involved in reshaping the educational  fabric and in how our young people are educated. A significant proportion of  the Budget is spent on education. I contend that issues that involve the  post-primary transfer have an impact on many other Departments, and it is,  therefore, logical to include them in any discussions that take place. A degree  of consensus would have to be reached in any ministerial subcommittee, and that  could then be taken to the Committee for Education, and, ultimately, to the  Assembly.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I went to Queen&rsquo;s University, and I remember having to do a  brief test that involved a team-building exercise. The outcome of that test was  that the collective wisdom of the group was greater than that of any  individual. I suggest that the Minister takes those thoughts on board.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Learning partnerships exist throughout Northern Ireland,  and those often include the further education sector. Indeed, I am aware of a  case in my constituency in which the University   of Ulster is involved.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I  urge the Minister to progress the issue constructively by establishing a  ministerial subcommittee.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  Having been charged with delivering a new Northern Ireland that is equal and  better for everyone who lives here, Members are in a unique position to act.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister said:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;equality is my watchword; equality of access and  equality of educational opportunity.&rdquo; &mdash; <span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; ">[Official Report, Vol 26,  No 1, p7, col 2].</span></span></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">She also said:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;the draft Programme for Government is explicit in  declaring that the watchwords of the Executive, in delivering all its policies  and programmes, will be fairness, inclusion and equality.&rdquo; &mdash; <span class="Italic"><span style="font-style:normal; ">[Official  Report, Vol 26, No 1, p10, col 1]</span></span>.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">There has been no sign of inclusion in this matter,  because the Committee has had to delve and beg for information in order to  answer many questions from constituents. Fairness and equality are important in  all the processes for which the Executive are responsible. It is vital that our  children and their parents and teachers are informed about a process of change  and the future of the education system.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister stated that the transfer from primary to  post-primary education should be as seamless as possible. However, thus far,  the alleged blueprint has been elusive, and the missing programme for change  has not been available. Regrettably, the fundamental necessities for achieving  change without chaos are invisible in this saga. It is neither fair nor  preferable that this situation of limbo is allowed to continue to trundle on  without a resolution. That is what will happen unless details concerning the  transfer procedure, area planning and sustainable schools are made available.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We are fewer than six weeks away from the end of term,  which should herald a carefree few months for children, parents and teachers in  Northern Ireland.  However, the vibe &mdash; and I declare an interest as a school governor &mdash; that those  of us who sit on boards of governors are getting is that the summer does not  look anything like a period of relaxation, but a summer of discontent, with  only more confusion to look forward to in the absence of key policies.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The stakeholders in education are parents, teachers and  children. The Minister said that she had far-reaching discussions with all the  stakeholders. She should be no stranger to the many concerns that teachers  have. The very fact that area-based planning is to be the basis for  post-primary entrants is of huge concern to educators.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Dominic Bradley &mdash; my colleague, not my husband &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Dominic&rsquo;s first profession was teaching, and he has  been forthright and justified in his detailed approach to this debate. There is  no need for me to reiterate his concerns. It is important to clarify that those  concerns are not personal; they are a true and honest reflection of the  concerns that have been put, on a daily basis, to us as public representatives.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">An Executive subcommittee is not the way to resolve this  issue. The Minister of Education is the person responsible &mdash; it is her  responsibility to act, and urgent action is required. There has been too much  delay thus far. The Minister must end the confusion and dispel the lack of  clarity. She must publish the details of the future transfer procedure. Her  paper to the Executive this Thursday must outline the details of the transfer  procedure, area planning and sustainable schools. Without those key policies,  the lack of clarity and the state of confusion will continue and will ferment.  Parents, pupils and teachers will not be reassured &mdash; they will only be further  disturbed.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that the Minister has got the message by now. I hope  that she will end the confusion by publishing her policies on all three  important elements of reform without any further delay. Parents, teachers and  children deserve that much, at least. I support amendment No 2.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCausland</strong>:  In dealing with the issue of post-primary transfer, the Minister is facing her  first major test. When one considers how she has performed in that test, her  performance has been marked by delay, procrastination, confusion and  confrontation. Her entire manner indicates that she is much more suited to be a  Minister of confrontation than a Minister of Education.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister talked, as did other Members, about a shared  future. That is one of the positive measures that this Assembly is considering  &mdash; how a cross-community consensus and an agreement for the future can be  created. One can certainly say that Caitr&iacute;ona Ruane has contributed to that.  Due to her attitude, she has created a consensus that is quite unique &mdash;  teachers, principals, parents, unionists, nationalists, people in the east of  the Province, and people in the west all share a common view. It does not  matter to whom one talks or where one goes, there is a cross-community  consensus that she is simply incompetent and incapable of doing the job. She  has at least managed to create a consensus around her incompetence.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It must also be noted that in dealing with the issue, the  Minister told us that she carried out consultation and sought to build  consensus by going out and speaking to this person, that person and the other  person. However, when the Committee listened to folk who came along to tell of  their experiences, it found that there had been no genuine consultation. The  Committee was given a presentation recently by a group from the education  sector who, when questioned, said that there had been a meeting way back a year  or so ago, but nothing since then. That meeting might have been with a  political adviser, but there was no real engagement with the Minister.  Nevertheless, those are people who hold important positions, as key  stakeholders in the education sector.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Although there has been much talk about consultation and consensus,  those who have been giving evidence to the Education Committee gave the  impression that there had not been the effort, endeavour and commitment that  the Minister suggests. Whom do I believe? Do I believe one deputation after  another, or do I believe the Minister? It is pretty clear whom one would  believe &mdash; all the deputations that come along and say with one voice that there  has not been the engagement that there should have been.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">If it were simply that the Minister had failed the test  regarding post-primary transfer, that would be bad enough. However, when one  looks at the Minister&rsquo;s record right across the education sector, one sees that  it is a record of failure after failure after failure, and some of the  decisions taken recently have shown that to be the case.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister is also responsible for the Youth Service,  which should be complementing our formal education system, yet what did she do?  She de-prioritised the Youth Service in her budget, when everyone else right  across the board put more money into their budgets. That will result in less  money going into the Youth Service in the coming years.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Funding had been put into some of the more difficult  interface areas in north Belfast and parts of west Belfast to deal with the  needs of schools in those areas &mdash; schools that have particular problems because  of the legacy of interface and other sectarian violence over a number of years.  What did the Minister do? She took away the funding. Nevertheless, teachers and  principals who attended the Committee put forward a clear argument and said  with a coherent voice that that was the wrong decision.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We see how the Minister is handling the issue of the proposed  education and skills authority. Right across the board, issue after issue, the  Minister has demonstrated her incompetence. The post-primary transfer issue  should be put to a subcommittee of the Executive. Moreover, the Minister should  acknowledge her incompetence and her inability to do the job, and do the right  thing. For the sake of the children, we should see not only the establishment  of a subcommittee but the resignation of the Minister.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>:  Today&rsquo;s debate is necessary only because the Education Minister has, once  again, failed in her role to introduce appropriate proposals for post-primary  transfer. The only way to formulate a strategy in time is to establish a  ministerial subcommittee &mdash; as my party called for previously in the Executive.  The decision must be taken out of the Minister&rsquo;s hands. The two Bradleys said  that if we went down that route, the Minister would then not be accountable for  the decisions. This side of the House wants to see the issue resolved, and if  the Minister is not willing to do that, we must set up a group that will.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I have spoken on this topic in the Chamber on many  occasions, and I have listened to the Minister deny repeatedly that there is  any panic or confusion among the public, parents or teachers. In that regard,  she is less of a Vera Duckworth and more of a Lance Corporal Jones in that her  rhetoric keeps referring to, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t panic, don&rsquo;t panic&rdquo;. I can assure the  Minister that there is panic. Education is among the top three biggest issues  that concern the people of Northern    Ireland, along with hospital cleanliness and  crime.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As has been mentioned, the DUP has hosted several  well-attended public meetings throughout Northern Ireland on the subject of  post-primary education transfer. The one clear message that came out of all  those meeting is that there is utter frustration with the way in which the  Minister is behaving and utter confusion as to what is going on.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">That is reflected in the action of the so-called breakaway  grammar schools, including Lumen   Christi College,  which have decided that, in the absence of firm and acceptable proposals, they  will formulate their own test. They are perfectly entitled to do so; as we  know, academic selection is safeguarded in law.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">3.00 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">My party colleague Ms McIlveen, along with Mr Basil McCrea,  mentioned the fact that the Minister&rsquo;s popularity was the subject of a poll  carried out by &lsquo;The Irish News&rsquo;, which gave the Education Minister the poorest  rating of all Ministers in the current Executive. The &lsquo;Belfast Telegraph&rsquo; ran  its own poll, which revealed that most people are still none the wiser as to  how she plans to transfer children from primary to post-primary schools, and  that most people disagree with her so-called vision of ending academic  selection. Importantly, that MORI poll for the &lsquo;Belfast Telegraph&rsquo; reports that  70% of adults in Northern    Ireland agree with some type of academic  selection, including 64% of Sinn F&eacute;in voters. It seems that even more people  wish to retain academic selection now than was the case six years ago.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The supposedly leaked Sinn F&eacute;in education position paper  actually acknowledges the fact that the Minister cannot abolish academic  selection, and that her guidelines can be ignored. That is why it is imperative  that she bring forward proposals that are acceptable to all sides of the House.  Because she has not done so, my party felt it appropriate to come up with our  own proposals, and put those to the public in a series of public meetings.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister, and the very few supporters that she has  left, make much of the notion of fairness, and of ensuring that children are  not penalised because of their social background. Of course, as my colleague Mr  Wilson mentioned earlier, evidence shows that the fairest way to do that is  through a system of selection, using criteria based on merit alone.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">If we move towards a system that uses geographical  criteria, as advocated by the Minister, or that involves all-ability or  comprehensive schools, the result would be that parents with the most money  would move closest to the most popular schools. That is already happening in areas  of Northern Ireland, just as  it happened in England and Scotland. In  fact, last Wednesday, I met the Archbishop of Dublin in this Building, and he  confirmed that it is also happening in Dublin,  where parents with most money are moving closest to the best schools.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Grammar schools will never struggle to fill their places.  It is the secondary schools that will suffer if the Minister does not react.  Whatever proposals are made, we must ensure that those schools that are more  vocational in nature do not suffer.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is clear to all that the Education Minister is not  listening to Members, to the teachers, or to the parents. She refuses to budge,  despite the opposition to her stance, even in her own party, if the murmurings  are to be believed. There is therefore no alternative but to establish a  ministerial subgroup to examine the issue. Ultimately, the Executive will have  the final say on the issue, but it would be beneficial, particularly in dealing  with this controversial and important decision, if some type of subgroup could  be established, such as was created to examine PPS 14 and the issue of water  charges.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There are genuine differences in the House on how we should  move forward, and that reflects the differing positions on both sides of the  House. However, it is important that we recognise both the legal realities and the  opinion of the vast majority of people in the Province, the majority of the  Executive, of the Assembly, and of the Education Committee, and use that as a  way through the impasse. The amendments tabled by Sinn F&eacute;in and the SDLP are  not acceptable, because we have been waiting for months already, and have seen  no movement from the Minister. I do not believe that people are willing to wait  any longer.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As Mr Lunn conceded, the Alliance Party amendment denotes  no timescale for the Minister to make her detailed proposals, and experience  tells us that we have waited long enough. That amendment would, once again,  allow the Minister off the hook. The original motion recognises that the  Minister is refusing to move, and that the decision must now be taken out of  her hands in order to see some progress.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  The Ulster Unionist Party proposed the motion without any desire to score cheap  political points, nor with a desire to politically assassinate a Minister. The  Ulster Unionist Party is not calling for the protection and promotion of some  schools at the expense of other schools. We have been driven to this position  by a growing and grave concern for the future of our education system, and,  most specifically, concern about the immediate prospects for the post-primary  transfer system.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">An education system is the foundation stone of any society.  A good education system is crucial to ensure our economic competitiveness and  social cohesion. There is, however, mounting public concern in all communities  in Northern Ireland  that the Education Minister simply does not know what she is doing. The 11-plus  ends this year, and in spite of being in office for over a year, the Minister  has come up with no proposals for what happens next.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Widespread &mdash; and sometimes, apparently, informed &mdash;  speculation suggests that she will bring a proposal for a graduated end to  academic selection to the Executive on Thursday. However, the detail of that  proposal and its long-term implications must be studied very carefully before  it is endorsed.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister has left schools with ridiculously  insufficient time to prepare parents and pupils. Instead, we have had to watch  &mdash; and I emphasise &ldquo;watch&rdquo; &mdash; a Minister on a destructive solo mission, which has  seen her ostracise the vast majority of education professionals, parents and  elements in the media.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister has fashioned the enviable position of creating  cross-community consensus. The only problem for her is that people have united  to question her competence. In newspaper opinion polls, letter pages,  editorials, public meetings, radio shows and parent-teacher associations, the  Minister&rsquo;s competence is being questioned.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There is no confidence in the Education Committee, the  Assembly, or the Executive in the Minister&rsquo;s actions. It appears that her own  party is being strongly whipped to support her, but that support has become  less enthusiastic, more begrudging and, on occasions, mute.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">While the Minister has carried out her ideological crusade,  she has also presided over severe reductions in extended schools&rsquo; funding that  will see the disappearance of after-school and breakfast clubs, badly affecting  the families and children who most need their services.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Equally, the Minister has overseen a budgetary allocation  that widens the gap in funding between primary and secondary schools. Further  testimony to her political failure is the fact that a Sinn F&eacute;in Minister now  presides over a system of independent entrance tests. The Association for  Quality Education made it clear that it did not want to go down that route.  However, without dialogue and guidance its members felt that they had been  forced into a corner.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">That did not stop the Minister from using bullying tactics  to attempt to batter them into submission. In Mafia-style language, the  Minister said:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;They have a choice, people always have a choice. What  I would say to them is think very carefully before you go down the route of  bringing boards of governors into situations where they may find themselves  spending their time in court.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The Minister, as a tennis player, has been in more  courts than Martina Navratilova. Her chilling words were not spared on Lumen Christi   College either, when she  said of its choice:</p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;The Board of Governors of Lumen Christi should be in no  doubt the Department of Education will not fund, facilitate or in any way  support a breakaway entrance exam.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The Minister might be called Minister Ruane. She  is, in effect, Minister of ruin. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education (Ms Ruane)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I  welcome the opportunity to speak to Members about the important issue of  post-primary transfer and the 11-plus. However, this is just one part of the  shake-up that our education system needs to bring it into the twenty-first  century. Since I became Education Minister on 8 May 2007, my priority has been  to achieve a way forward and to make the education system work for all our  children.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">&Oacute; rinneadh Aire Oideachais don Tuaisceart d&iacute;om, bhuail m&eacute;  leis na p&aacute;irtithe leasmhara uilig chun cl&aacute;r leasaithe ar an ch&oacute;ras oideachais a  phl&eacute;, chomh maith le socruithe d&rsquo;aistri&uacute; iarbhunoideachais in ionad an 11-plus.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I immediately set about meeting all stakeholders to discuss  the wide range of education reform issues, including the question of replacing  the 11-plus with new arrangements for post-primary transfer. The last 11-plus  tests take place this year, and it is now difficult to find anyone who ever  supported them.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Advancing that programme of reform requires strong leadership  combined with a willingness to engage with people representing a wide range of  views.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">During the following six months, I initiated a process of  policy review and development in all areas of education in which change is  needed; and that development involved many more issues than the narrow issue of  academic selection. The future of post-primary education is part of a holistic  reconsideration of how that provision is organised, the curriculum it will  deliver and the wider education system in which it operates. Underpinning all  of that is the central issue of improving quality of learning and raising  standards for all children.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Those issues have been taken forward through a new  school-improvement policy called Every School a Good School, Gach scoil ina  scoil mhaith, which will be implemented in September 2008. The Department will  also do more to raise achievement levels, especially in literacy and numeracy.  It wants to go far beyond measures of success in examinations by placing a high  value on excellent pastoral care; on fostering a spirit of good citizenship,  and on promoting in all pupils a strong desire for lifelong learning that will  equip them for adulthood and make them confident, creative and articulate young  people.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">During the past 12 months, I have talked to hundreds of  teachers, school principals, parents, children and people who are interested in  education. I have engaged in extensive fact finding. I have carried out  wide-ranging discussion and consultation on how to make progress. Some people  have criticised me for not having instant solutions to the challenges facing  the education system. I have been in office for just one year. During that  time, I have worked on several progressive proposals and initiatives to  transform a 60-year-old education system into one that is fit for the  twenty-first century.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Aithn&iacute;m go bhfuil roinnt daoine go l&aacute;idir i gcoinne na  forbartha. Agus m&eacute; ag glacadh c&eacute;ime chun tosaigh, chaith m&eacute; cuid mhaith ama le  teacht ar chomhdhearcadh ar an chur chuige is fearr.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I acknowledge that there is deep resistance to change in  some quarters. I have taken considerable time to try and build consensus on the  way forward. Having listened to and learned from a wide range of views, I have  prepared proposals that will command support from as many people as possible.  Frankly, on such an issue, it would be impossible to produce proposals on which  everyone could agree. However, with the future of children&rsquo;s education as my  focus, I believe that my proposals represent the best way forward.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The main drivers of the changes are: the demographic trends  that have led to there being 50,000 empty desks in classrooms &mdash; a figure that  is set to rise; the obligation to deliver the entitlement framework with  increased educational options for young people at age 14 and post-16 years of  age; and the need to raise standards and tackle the long tail of  underachievement &mdash; particularly in working-class communities. The system cannot  stand still, and things cannot go on as they have in the past.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Delivering the range of initiatives and reforms, which  include the entitlement framework; the Every School a Good School, Gach scoil  ina scoil mhaith, policy; the new transfer arrangements, and area-based  planning, are essential if we are to give every child the greatest range of  education opportunities while tackling the serious problem in the education  system of underachievement. They are also essential to how education will  support long-term economic growth. It must also be recognised that to make a  real impact on poverty and disadvantage, the education system must provide  every child with access to quality education.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Members are aware that, particularly in the aftermath of  the investment conference, more must be done to produce the talented  individuals that the economy requires. That means extending academic excellence  across all of the education system and not limiting it in any way, shape or  form. The Every School a Good School, Gach scoil ina scoil mhaith, policy has  been developed following discussions with teachers and young people about what  they believe drives school improvement and characterises a good school.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">That has reached consultation stage, and I look forward to  its outcome. I will take on board what teachers &mdash; the reflective practitioners  &mdash; propose. The policy will set out how we deliver improvement at every level of  the education system. A targeted programme of school improvement will be rolled  out to ensure that every school is a good school. Every school is capable of,  and should actively strive for, improvement in teaching and learning. From  talks that I have had with many teachers and school principals, I know that we  have a workforce that is committed to, and capable of, delivering those  improvements.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">T&aacute; a fhios agam go bhfuil na scileanna agus an tiomantas ag  ceannair&iacute; le c&oacute;ras oideachais den scoth a shol&aacute;thar a fhreagra&iacute;onn do  riachtanais gach dalta.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I know that school leaders have the necessary commitment  and skills to deliver a high-quality education system that is responsive to the  individual needs of every pupil. I want to see academic excellence across the  entire education system. I do not want any child to be denied the right to an  academic education, just as I want every child to be able to access the fullest  range of educational pathways, including vocational excellence.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The revised curriculum was introduced here in September  2007. Its focus, in the early years, is on developing knowledge and skills at  Key Stage 4 to ensure a greater range of educational opportunity and experience  for young people.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">At Key Stage 4, when children are aged 14, the introduction  of the entitlement framework will ensure that all pupils, irrespective of their  background or where they live, will have equal rights to choose from a wider  range of courses and pathways. Pupils aged 14 will have the right to choose  from 24 options, and pupils at post-16 level will have 27 options to choose  from.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">That process of policy development culminated in my speech  to the Assembly on 4 December 2007 in which I set out my vision for education  in the North, based on election at 14 and informed choice in an area-planned  post-primary system that is designed to deliver the entitlement framework and  meet the needs of young people.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">At that point, I initiated a series of meetings with all the  stakeholders, including: trade unions; the Association of Head Teachers of  Secondary Schools; the children&rsquo;s rights sector; the Governing Bodies  Association, the Transferers Representative Council; the Catholic Trustees; and  the chief executives of the education and library boards. I sought written  responses from those groups and from the Committee for Education by 11 January  2008. Following that, I arranged a further series of meetings in February and  March with the stakeholders that are most central to the transfer process.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Ar 4 M&aacute;rta, d&rsquo;fh&oacute;gair m&eacute; beart plean&aacute;la at&aacute; bunaithe sa  cheantar le d&iacute;ri&uacute; ar an oideachas iarbhunscoile; beidh an beart seo &aacute; chur i  bhfeidhm ag gr&uacute;pa&iacute; plean&aacute;la at&aacute; bunaithe sa cheantar. .</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">On 4 March 2008, I announced a post-primary-focused  area-planning exercise, which has been implemented by area-based planning  groups. The job of those groups will be to introduce proposals for the best  design of post-primary provision in each area in order to deliver the full  entitlement framework of 2013. Some schools will be able to deliver, on their  own, the range of courses that are required under the entitlement framework.  However, many others will need to collaborate with other schools, further  education colleges and other providers.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">On the specific issue of transfer policy, I have developed  a wide-ranging package of proposals that take account of the fact that some  schools will need time to adjust to the necessary changes in order to provide a  high-quality education. That is what we are about.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The extensive consultation on the new transfer arrangements  is now complete. I will present my proposals to the Executive on 15 May, which  is in two days&rsquo; time, and after that, I will engage with the Committee for  Education.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is my intention to prepare new admissions-criteria  regulations for schools admissions for September 2010 and beyond. Replacing a  60-year-old system was never going to be easy, and there are no quick-fix  solutions. My discussions with all sectors have been detailed and exhaustive.  Throughout the process, I have engaged with people who represent all sides of  the debate. I recognise that parents have fears about what will happen to their  children. I rehearsed all those matters to make a simple point.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Since coming into office, I have conducted an inclusive and  exhaustive process that is designed to deliver a resolution to the question of  post-primary transfer and the wider imperatives for reform. That is the only  responsible resolution to the issue of transfer, because it considers the issue  as part of a bigger picture and through a consultative and inclusive approach.  We cannot stay still; the world around us is constantly changing, and we must  give all our children the greatest opportunities so that they can contribute  positively to our community and to our society.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">On 15 May, I will bring proposals to the Executive.  Therefore, I see no need for a subcommittee to be involved in the issue. The  issue has required, and still requires, leadership and resolve. I have provided  both, and I will continue to do so. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>: To  my disappointment, the Minister did not answer my question, and she did not  even refer to it. I asked whether the Minister could assure the House that the  proposals would be brought before the Assembly for debate without accelerated  passage or any subterfuge or attempts to bypass the Assembly. I am particularly  disappointed that she did not mention that.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister said that the proposal will come before the  Executive in the next couple of days and that it would subsequently come to the  Committee for Education. However, she did not say when it would come to the  Committee, and I am concerned by that. Without meaning any disrespect, I heard  the Minister make the same speech a few months ago.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  That is a trait of the Education Minister: she regurgitates the same mantras  that we have heard over the past few weeks. She talked about consultation. Does  the Member accept that, on 4 March 2008, the Minister made a great play about  area planning, and wrote to the chief executives of the education and library  boards four weeks later, on 2 April? The Education Committee is still waiting  for the terms of reference for her plans on area-based planning. The Minister  wants to provide only the information that she wants us to have, and when she  wants to provide it. We have no confidence in the Minister, and the best thing  that she can do is resign.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>:  That was some intervention; I will not comment on it.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion calls on the Executive to create a ministerial  subcommittee, and perhaps one will be created. Basil McCrea and Sammy Wilson  said &mdash;<span class="Italic"> [Interruption.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. Comments are flying from one side of the House to the  other, and I cannot hear Mr Lunn&rsquo;s speech. Members on one side of the House are  making comments; they could not have known what the Minister said because they  were holding their own conversations. I call for order in the House.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>: The  motion calls on the Executive to create a subcommittee. Basil McCrea and Sammy  Wilson made that proposal sound as though it was intended as a helping hand to  the Minister. I contrast that with the demands from Michelle McIlveen, Nelson  McCausland, Mervyn Storey and others that the Minister resign. Alastair Ross  put his finger on the matter when he said that he wanted to take the decision  out of the Minister&rsquo;s hands. One cannot have it both ways &mdash; that is not going  to happen.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Much mention was made of polls and radio phone-ins, such as  the &lsquo;The Stephen Nolan Show&rsquo; &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>: No.  I have fallen foul of the rule on interventions before.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Such polls can prove anything. A couple of years ago, a  poll showed that 84% of people wanted their children to be educated in the  integrated system. I was heartened by that poll, but I did not believe it.  Michelle McIlveen mentioned a poll that was taken of primary school principals.  In the past year, I have not spoken to a primary school principal who wants to  retain academic selection. In common with the Minister, I can find hardly  anyone who wants to retain it.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Although I do not go to DUP public meetings, everyone that  I speak to &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>A Member</strong>:  Perhaps the Member should.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>:  Maybe I should, but then nobody would be at ours. Frankly, one gets the  reaction that one would expect from such people.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The people who take the trouble to talk to me, particularly  the parents of P5 children, are frustrated and concerned, and we all know that.  However, in two days&rsquo; time, hopefully, the process will restart. Talk about a  ministerial subcommittee will not advance that process, except as a means of  having the debate that we have had several times before &mdash; it was not just the  Minister&rsquo;s speech that sounded familiar; many of the other contributions did as  well.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>A Member</strong>:  Including your own.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>: If  you like.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I was concerned when Dominic Bradley said that the papers  have already been informed. Danny Kennedy mentioned &mdash; I have done some harm to  Mr McNarry. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Danny Kennedy said that he had heard a leak about a  graduated end to selection. I am concerned about leaks. The process is going on  in a vacuum, and, in a vacuum, one gets leaks.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Like everybody else, I encourage the Minister to come clean  to the Assembly about her proposals, and that is the thrust of the Alliance  Party&rsquo;s amendment. Even at this late stage and although our amendment does not  stipulate a time limit, I hope that the other parties might accept it because  it is realistic.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Mr McCrea began the debate by  speaking, as I did, about the Minister&rsquo;s delay in providing information, and I  will address that in more detail later. He also quoted two surveys: one in &lsquo;The  Irish News&rsquo;, in which 93&middot;3% of school principals declared that they had  insufficient information, and the other in the &lsquo;Belfast Telegraph&rsquo;, stating  that 62% of parents do not understand the Minister&rsquo;s plans. Mr McCrea said that  that has led to the Minister&rsquo;s competence being questioned far and wide and  that the public perceive the Minister to be failing. He also predicted that, during  the Minister&rsquo;s watch, she would preside over unregulated academic selection. Mr  McCrea suggested that the mechanism of an Executive subcommittee would ensure  that the Minister fulfilled her wider obligations and bolster public  confidence. I share Mr McCrea&rsquo;s concern, but I disagree with his proposed  solution.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">On Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s behalf, Michelle O&rsquo;Neill argued that the  motion is already outdated because the Minister intends to present a paper to  the Executive on Thursday &mdash; assuming that it is not in this evening&rsquo;s &lsquo;Belfast  Telegraph&rsquo;. However, she could not say what is in that paper. She claimed that,  by proposing the formation of an Executive subcommittee, the UUP wishes to  bypass the democratic process and, thus, take power from the Minister. However,  the Minister&rsquo;s colleague Conor Murphy had no such hesitation about giving his  power to an Executive subcommittee in order to avoid a watery grave.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Trevor Lunn largely agreed with me about the need to hold  the Minister to account and to ensure that she faces up to her  responsibilities. I encourage him to go one step further and support my  amendment.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As I said, the dearth of information is clear to the  public. We have no policy detail about area-based planning or sustainable  schools. We still do not know what the areas will be, how they will be defined  and how boundaries will be established. In the post-selection era, education  providers will have to live in a vastly changed education landscape. They will  have to decide how education is to be delivered in their sector through  existing schools and in collaboration with schools from other sectors. How can  they make such decisions without knowing the areas in which they will work?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Naturally, various sectors will bring their interests to  the area-planning table. Those interests will need to be reconciled with the  overall vision for each area. What is the Minister&rsquo;s advice on how to best  achieve that? How will area-based planning operate in the context of open  enrolment? The two concepts do not sit easily side by side &mdash; one could argue  that they are mutually exclusive. Will open enrolment be ended? If so, how will  that impact on parental choice in certain areas? On what basis will area  boundaries be established? Those are all legitimate questions that must be  answered. However, the answers have not been forthcoming.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">3.30 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The consultation on sustainable schools closed at Easter  2007, and the Minister has yet to announce her response. That policy is closely  connected to the other reforms that are under discussion to address falling  rolls and the effective use of funding. Area-based planning could have a  significant effect on the sustainability of schools, but it will be impossible  to reorganise education on an area basis without a guiding policy. More than a year  after the consultation on sustainable schools ended, we have not had sight of a  policy.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion would accommodate the lack of accountability  that already exists and allow the Minister to shirk her responsibilities again.  We are not here to let the Minister off the hook; we are here to hold her to  account. On that basis, I ask members to support amendment No 2. Go raibh maith  agat.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Basil McCrea began the debate by  telling the House what the debate was not about. However, in telling us what  the debate was about, he outlined the same issues that he said the debate was  not about. I know that I am in the presence of greatness and that Mr McCrea has  recently received an award, but even I did not understand the context in which  he was placing the debate.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The origins of the motion lie in a television debate during  which Basil McCrea was challenged by the presenter to outline his proposals for  post-primary transfer. He studied for a while and said that his party would  pursue proposals. However, the motion does not constitute pursuing proposals &mdash;  it is a waste of debating time and a waste of the Assembly&rsquo;s time. The process  has moved on from meaningless debates. The Minister will outline her proposals  to the Executive on Thursday, which will be crystal clear in detailing the way  forward. All the parties who have Ministers in the Executive will have sight of  those proposals on Thursday.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In his contribution, Mr Basil McCrea seemed to speak on  behalf of &ldquo;everybody&rdquo;. He claimed that everybody knows that the Minister does  not know what she is doing, and that nobody knows what is happening. However, everybody  does not agree with John O&rsquo;Dowd. Members should not make such broad-based  statements in the Chamber.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a perception among the parties on the Benches  opposite that the eradication of academic selection is a plot that ahs been  dreamed up by Sinn F&eacute;in. However, for decades, teachers&rsquo; unions,  educationalists and other interested organisations have said that the academic selection  &mdash; particularly the 11-plus &mdash; is detrimental to the education of children. The  list of people that are opposed to academic selection includes; the Association  of Head Teachers; teachers&rsquo; trade unions; the vast majority of educationalists;  the Catholic Church; some grammar schools, which have indicated that they are  leaving the system; and, although one could not tell from its Members&rsquo;  speeches, the SDLP. Therefore, ending academic selection is not simply a Sinn  F&eacute;in plot &mdash; there is a large and growing body of opinion that we must move away  from academic selection.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Although the education system in England  is not the same as ours, the front page of &lsquo;The Daily Telegraph&rsquo; carries the  story that a Select Committee at Westminster,  which some Members may hold in high regard, has stated that academic selection  damages the education of children.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is not simply a Sinn F&eacute;in plot.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>: I  have only a limited amount of time, Sammy.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The comments of the Alliance Party are fair enough &mdash; I do  not agree with them all, but at least the Alliance Party is allowing the  Minister to present the proposals and is allowing them to be debated in a  rational manner. That is the way forward.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Sammy Wilson &mdash; who was not speaking as the Chairperson of  the Education Committee &mdash; made an informed contribution to the debate. Other  Members were not so informed. As for Miss McIlveen&rsquo;s contribution, if an  argument has to resort to personal insults, there is no substance to it. I  could trade personal insults with Miss McIlveen &mdash; she is a good subject to work  on. However, I will not, because that would be immature.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mervyn Storey questioned the Sinn F&eacute;in reshuffle. I will  let Members into a secret: I was offered the opportunity to spend every Friday  morning with Sammy Wilson, Mervyn Storey and Michelle McIlveen, and I jumped at  the chance. How could I resist that?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The debate will progress on Thursday. Members have a  responsibility to approach the debate and the proposals on post-primary  education in a responsible and mature manner. Educationalists, parents and  children are fed up of listening to the political battle that has been raging  on. It is time to start debating education. Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann  Comhairle.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Perhaps unusually for me, I have sat quietly and listened to the debate. I am  somewhat disappointed by some of the comments that were made by Members who  feel that people are not moving on. The reason why I spoke in the manner that I  did &mdash; and the reason why Sammy Wilson spoke in the manner that he did &mdash; is  because we are actively looking for a solution. Tub-thumping does no good. I  can make those types of speeches, and I am happy to take interventions and to  stand my corner, but that is not helpful. I agree with Sammy Wilson, 100%.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">People are looking to the Assembly to find solutions. If a  solution on education is not found that is satisfactory to the majority of  people in Northern Ireland,  this Assembly, this Executive, and this body politic will fail and will fall.  The situation is that serious. It is easy to say that the debate is just a bit  of pat-a-cake, and that we can have a little joke, but education is important  for the future of Northern    Ireland and its people.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Today, I have endured jibes from the DUP, disappoint&shy;ment  from the SDLP, ridicule from Sinn F&eacute;in and a complete list of misdemeanours  from the Alliance Party. I must be doing something right because there seems to  be a consensus on my comments from those parties. What really disappoints me is  that words are being twisted. In trying to reach accommodation, one can be  accused of having a change of mind. The UUP has not changed its mind. We are  trying to reach an accommodation.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is not fair to say that people argued for the 11-plus.  No one, including the Minister, has been able to come up with a viable  alternative. The UUP is seeking a fair, inclusive and rational alternative.  That cannot be done in six months. The Minister talked of criticism of her for  not having instant solutions, because she has been in the job for only one  year. We are not doing that. We are saying that she should not have removed a  working system until she had some idea of what was going to replace it. That  has led to the panic and the disappoint&shy;ment that people are experiencing.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">By all means, she should introduce proposals and ideas  about which she wants to talk to the Assembly, but she must not throw the baby  out with the bath water &mdash; she must first put some sort of solution in place.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">John O&rsquo;Dowd mentioned all the people who opposed academic  selection &mdash; the unions and so on and so forth. It must have come as a shock to  him to discover that a poll showed that only 8% of people of Northern Ireland  think that the Minister is doing a good job. It must come as a surprise when he  talks to people who ask if there is any information on developments. The issue  is not whether we are moving in the right direction. The issue is that there is  no way forward and there are no plans &mdash; that is what is unacceptable.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We come then to the twisting of words. The Minister of  Education says that she knows that there are people against change. However,  change for the sake of change is not the right way forward. Her party has been  in existence for over 100 years. That seems far too long to me. It is about  time that its members stopped going on about a united Ireland or  whatever other principles it believes in. That is the logic that the Minister  tries to apply to our position. I see that my remarks have caused some mirth.  However, contrary to the argument that the Minister tries to make to us, the  sophisticated argument that we try to put across concerns points of principle.  Just because something has been working for some time does not mean that it is  wrong. People are entitled to their views, and if there are efforts to build  some form of consensus, then we must have something to talk about.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We are told that there will be an announcement in two days&rsquo;  time; however, what happens when the Minister presents her proposals? That is  the big question. I put that question to Mr Lunn or Mr Bradley. On the off  chance that Sinn F&eacute;in is not correct and that it does not sweep all in front of  it, then what? Just say those Members disagree with the proposals, will they  and other Members have a chance to debate them or express their views? Mary  Bradley talked about inclusion. The Education Committee has not been included  in anything. Its members have had no sight of the proposals and are not engaged  in the process. It is therefore hardly surprising that we cannot tell people  outside what the way forward is.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  As long as he does not take as long as other Members have done.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>: I  would never do that. Does the Member not agree that the thrust of the Alliance  Party&rsquo;s amendment is that there should be time for full debate on the  proposals, both at Committee and in the Assembly?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I take Mr Lunn&rsquo;s point. I understand the purpose of the amendment; however, I  cannot support it, because we do not have time for full consideration of the  proposals. We do not have the time to bring legislation through. We have wasted  a year. Had we wanted to go down that route, we should have done so earlier.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am not a great supporter of Executive subcommittees and  so on, but I see no other forum through which the Assembly can thrash out a  solution to this problem &mdash; and a solution is badly needed. If someone else can  come up with some other approach, or if we can have a grand debate in the  Chamber and sort this matter out in one day, fair enough. However, all that  will happen is that people will restate their positions. I, too, have heard all  the speeches. Through this debate, I tried to introduce something different.  The people of Northern    Ireland will not forgive us if we cannot  find some kind of solution.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr O&rsquo;Dowd says that this motion is a continuation of a  television debate. To be frank, a television studio is about the only place  that we can have any debate. It has come as some relief that the Member is now  the party&rsquo;s education spokesman because, for quite a long time, I thought that  the Minister of Education was not talking to me personally. I do not know how  to engage: I do not have the opportunity to talk about the issues, even though  I have plenty of ideas that I want to put forward.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;&iacute;n says that those in favour of academic selection  do not represent the vast majority of people, but that cannot be so &mdash; the DUP  is the largest party in the House, and the UUP is the third largest party, so  together we represent a large number of people. Moreover, I will even say to  Members on this side of the House that a significant number of people from the  Roman Catholic tradition share our concerns about academic criteria. We are not  being prescriptive about how this matter should progress. To fly in the face of  what the people want is absolutely undemocratic, and it ill behoves any of us  here to support such a solution.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Some said that we were a little too late in bringing this  motion to the Chamber. Frankly, we did the best we could: we submitted the  motion and waited for it to be called. Suddenly &mdash; miraculously &mdash; the subject is  now on the Executive&rsquo;s agenda. Pulling a rabbit out of a hat is no way to run a  country &mdash; that is kindergarten stuff. We need mature dialogue, reflection and  debate, and to seek compromise, because not everything proposed is wrong. As  things now appear, if this matter is not resolved before the summer, there will  be a war of attrition. I hope that in the Minister&rsquo;s proposals will be a better  way of sorting out the next few years than having schools doing their own  thing, because there are dangers in that. I hope, too, that the Minister will  not cap the finances of those schools that do not go along with her way of  thinking, because any such proposal amounts to bullying and would be  unacceptable in a civilised country.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Surely there is a better way. Surely the Minister  recognises, when she looks at the opinion polls and listens to Members&rsquo;  speeches, that there is some small value in what we have to say.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  What will be the Member&rsquo;s impressions if the Minister, in making this challenge  to us, fails to win Executive support for her proposals?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order, the Member&rsquo;s time is up. Your intervention was very badly  timed, Mr McNarry. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Before I put the question on amendment No 1, I advise  Members that if this, or any subsequent amendment, is made, all other  amendments will fall, and I will proceed to put the question on the motion as  amended.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question, <span style="font-style:normal; ">That  amendment No 1 be made,</span> put and negatived.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question,<span style="font-style:normal; "> That  amendment No 2 be made,</span> put and negatived.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question,<span style="font-style:normal; "> That  amendment No 3 be made,</span> put and negatived.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Main Question put and agreed to.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly, given high levels of public concern,  calls on the Executive to create a Ministerial Sub-Committee to recommend  appropriate regulations to govern post-primary transfer from 2010.</p>
		    <p class="H4StageHeading"><a name="5"></a>Irish-Medium Schools in &nbsp;Dungannon/South Tyrone</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour and 30  minutes for the debate. The proposer of the motion will have 10 minutes to  propose and 10 minutes to make a winding-up speech. All other Members who wish  to speak will have five minutes to do so.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">A valid petition of concern was presented on Tuesday 6 May  2008 in relation to the motion. The effect of the petition is that the vote on  the motion will be on a cross-community basis.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly calls on the Minister of Education to  abandon proposals to establish primary and post-primary Irish-medium schools in  Dungannon and the wider South Tyrone area where there are already a  considerable number of long-term unfilled places; and expresses its concern at  the detrimental impact the creation of such schools would have on both present  and future education budgets.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Before I get into the meat of the motion, it has  been brought to our attention that a petition of concern has been signed by  more than 30 Members. That is quite significant, and it tells us something  about those Members who are opposed to the motion. They know that they cannot  win the debate by the force of argument, so they reached for the most blunt  instrument in the box &mdash; a petition of concern.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The other significant factor is that the SDLP feels  compelled to be greener than the shinners on this issue, and my constituency  colleague Tommy Gallagher finds himself compelled to lead the charge. In an  article in yesterday&rsquo;s &lsquo;Irish News&rsquo;, Mr Gallagher talked balderdash and failed  to address any of the issues. Instead, he opted for a sectarian rant, and that  is to be deplored. I am sure that when he reads that article, he will hang his  head in shame.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Gallagher comes from a rural constituency, and he is a  former teacher. Therefore, I fail to understand why he wants to pour millions  of pounds into an Irish language school when many rural schools in his  constituency are being closed down by the Minister. When the Member and his  party reflect on that issue, they will have many regrets.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to bring some important points to the attention of  the House, and I look forward to hearing other Members&rsquo; opinions on the issue.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. Will you clarify what issue is under  debate? So far, I have only heard the proposer of the motion launching a  bitter, personal attack on me.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: That was not a point of order.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  If Mr Gallagher holds on tight, he will hear all right. I am surprised that he  had any difficulty in hearing me &mdash; I thought that I was quite clear. Nevertheless,  I will speak louder, if that is the problem.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister stated in a document that was published by her  Department that some families in the Dungannon area have opted for Irish-medium  education. She went on to say that there will be 17 pupils on the roll in  September 2008. By my calculations, that means that there are three or four  families who are interested in educating their children in an Irish-speaking  school.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I see that the Minister is not in her place, which is a  further example that she is not going to pay much attention to what anyone has  to say. Nevertheless, I will pose the question: if three or four families get  together on any educational issue, will special terms be set aside for them? It  is a disgrace that the Minister is going to strip millions of pounds from her  budget to pour into an Irish-medium school. There is an equality issue, which  must be tested in another place, at another time. We will observe the situation  carefully.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister does not often answer questions that are put  to her. She fumbles about, but she seldom, if ever, answers any questions that  are put to her. My colleague Sammy Wilson asked her questions about the  enrolment in that school in Dungannon. In her reply, she said that she could  not estimate the number of children who would be attending that school. In a document  that her Department produced on 7 May 2008, she stated that the review of  Irish-medium education will not be completed until the end of May 2008.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, she proceeds to open schools without demonstrating  forward thinking or giving any thought to planning or strategy.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  Does the Member agree that the situation is even worse than he states? Many new  Irish-medium schools employ people who are not qualified teachers. School  inspectors&rsquo; results reflect that fact and highlight the quality of education  being offered to youngsters.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  My colleague Mr Wilson makes a succinct point. I am sure that the Minister is  listening but paying little attention &mdash; that is sad. It strikes me and my  colleagues on this side of the House that the Minister does not take her  responsibilities seriously. If I were a member of Sinn F&eacute;in, I would ask how  much longer we can tolerate Caitr&iacute;ona &mdash; given the position that she is in, she  has outlived her usefulness. Mr O&rsquo;Dowd has become the party&rsquo;s education  spokesperson, so he may be the Minister-in-waiting. To be fair to him, he could  not do a worse job &mdash; no matter how hard he tried &mdash; than Caitr&iacute;ona Ruane.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>:  Does the Member agree that the Minister has become so much of a lame duck that  she would be wise to avoid walking past Jim Shannon&rsquo;s house? <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span><span class="B3BodyTextItalicChar"><span style="font-size:11.0pt; "> </span></span></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  Yes. Mr Weir&rsquo;s point is that Mr Shannon is an avid shooter, noted for shooting  doves.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I suspect that Mr Gallagher will speak during the debate,  because he is a former teacher from a rural constituency &mdash; the same  constituency as me and my colleague Arlene Foster.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">During the debate on post-primary transfer, the Minister  said that 50,000 desks sit empty in schools across Northern Ireland. Within 10 years,  that figure will have increased by 30,000, at which stage the number of empty  desks will verge on 100,000. Despite that, the Minister feels compelled to pour  millions of pounds into opening an Irish-medium school in Dungannon, even  though she cannot yet guarantee the enrolment of 17 pupils.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Does anyone believe the opening of such schools to be  anything other than blatant squandering of public funds? I suspect that the  Minister will be pleased to open those schools to satisfy her naked sectarian  agenda. She thinks that she is the Minister for Sinn F&eacute;in &mdash; she must realise  that she is the Minister of Education. She is responsible for all Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  population, not only a dozen or so people dotted across the country. She has a  responsibility to provide an equitable education system for all the children of  Northern Ireland.  However, she is failing miserably in that duty.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is time that the Minister caught herself on &mdash; before  others catch her on. Her party colleagues should already be telling her to  respond to the needs and demands of children, parents and teachers. They are  the real stake&shy;holders in Northern    Ireland, who want the establishment of a  proper education system rather than the education system that the Minister  offers. She must heed Members&rsquo; views. She may win today&rsquo;s debate on the  strength of tabling a petition of concern, through which she trapped the SDLP  into following her sectarian agenda. Regrettably, the SDLP wants to demonstrate  that it is as green as Sinn F&eacute;in. It is not necessary to demonstrate that; we  were all aware of that fact before the debate, and, therefore, the SDLP has  missed the boat completely. Tommy Gallagher has wasted his time and will,  undoubtedly, waste his breath when he attempts to convince the House to the  contrary.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I see that my time to speak is slipping away, so I will  finish by saying to the Minister that she should devote her time to developing  a quality education system in Northern Ireland that will stand the test of time  &mdash; an education system of which she should be proud. Sadly, she is not  interested in that. I see that my time is now up.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">4.00 pm</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I oppose the motion. The Irish  language &mdash; the native language of this country &mdash; has been used as a spoken  language for nearly 2,000 years, and it is an important part of people&rsquo;s  cultural identity and roots. However, as I have said before in the House, it  does not belong to any one section of the community; it belongs to everyone,  and we should take ownership of it and promote it as part of our shared  heritage.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The promotion of the Irish language is an integral part of  life in Dungannon and in the rest of south Tyrone. Gaelscoil U&iacute; N&eacute;ill is a very  successful primary school in the Dungannon and South Tyrone Borough Council  area, and it is an excellent example of the advantages that Irish-medium  education can bring to a child&rsquo;s development. I have spoken to many parents in  Dungannon who are keen to have their children educated through the medium of  Irish, but who are unable to do so because of the lack of provision.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is for that reason that I oppose the motion in the  strongest terms. It is a blatant attempt to discriminate in the guise of concern  about the number of unfilled school places, which has no relevance to this  argument. Irish-medium education will not rely on an increase in the number of  school-age children, but will fill a gap for those children who wish to be  educated through Irish.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">For several reasons, not least the commitment that was  given in the Good Friday Agreement, but also on the basis of equality, there is  an onus on the Minister of Education to provide facilities and support for  those who wish to be taught through Irish. I only wish that the unionist  politicians in the Chamber would understand that this is not about giving more  to one education sector. The Irish-medium sector was neglected and ignored  under direct rule. Yet, despite that, dedicated Gaels have worked tirelessly  and without any financial support from the Department of Education to provide  Irish-medium education for those who wish to avail themselves of it.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The demand for Irish-medium education is increasing. It is  the fastest-growing education sector in the North, despite the overall  reduction in the school-age population. The Irish-medium education sector is in  a healthy state. We should welcome that fact and not punish those who are  involved. We should also respect the rights of parents to choose to have their kids  educated in the Irish-medium sector, the rights of teachers to teach in the  sector, and the rights of children to be educated in the sector.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There is an onus on Mrs Foster and Mr Morrow to represent  all their constituents to the best of their ability and to be honest with those  constituents. Mrs Foster and Mr Morrow signed up to the Programme for  Government; in case they are in any doubt, let me draw their attention to  objective 4 of public service agreement (PSA) 10, &lsquo;Helping Our Children and  Young People to Achieve Through Education&rsquo;, which is:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;To maximise high quality Irish-medium provision for  those children whose parents wish it.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I would be grateful if the proposers of the motion would  tell me what research they have done in Dungannon and the greater south Tyrone  area to gauge support for, or opposition to, the establishment of Irish-medium  education. If they have carried out research, what are the results, and was it  carried out on a cross-community basis?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Minister Foster has a large portfolio, which includes the  Planning Service. That agency has a serious backlog, and if we are to secure  much-needed investment on the back of the recent economic conference, I am sure  that the resulting planning applications from business will cause the Planning  Service&rsquo;s backlog to grow. Would the Minister&rsquo;s efforts not be better placed in  addressing &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. The Member is, of course, aware that I  support the motion as a constituency representative and not as the Minister of  the Environment.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Point taken.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  I am sure that the Minister of Education will examine the feasibility of the  proposal to establish a grant-aided Irish-medium primary school in Dungannon  from 1 September, and I am sure that she will treat the proposal as she would  any other, by applying the relevant criteria without prejudice. When the  consultation is completed and the Minister&rsquo;s recommendations are made known, I  hope that we will accept them, as a result of due process, for the benefit of  the education of children in the Dungannon area.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  I support the motion, and I have concerns about Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s view.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Given that pupil numbers are declining in Northern Ireland  and that there are increasingly large numbers of vacant places in our schools,  it seems strange that the Minister is opening new schools that will solely  facilitate the Irish-medium sector. Those schools will have small numbers of  pupils in comparison with mainstream schools.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The October 2006 Northern Ireland schools census highlights  an estimated 36,000 surplus places in the primary sector and 18,500 spare  places in the post-primary sector. Taking those figures into account, the  desire to open more small schools that cater for a minority seems illogical.  There are other ways for children and young people &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brolly</strong>: I  thank the Member for giving way. It is important to point out that it is not  necessary to build new schools in order to facilitate Irish-medium education.  In my hometown, Dungiven, the Irish-medium stream is part of the main primary  school, and that process is ongoing. We do not necessarily need new buildings.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  I wonder whether Mr Brolly is clarifying the position in south Tyrone, in  Dungannon and in other areas, such as County Fermanagh, where Irish-medium  pupils may be facilitated in the Catholic-maintained sector, because it is my  understanding that new schools are being built. There are other cost-effective  ways of facilitating Irish-medium education, as Mr Brolly said, but I do not  believe that the Department is taking that route.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am also concerned that, in the past, someone from an  Irish republican background said that every word spoken in Irish was like a  bullet to the heart of unionism. Sinn F&eacute;in has used the Irish language as a  political weapon. If Sinn F&eacute;in were to stop using the language as a political  weapon, it might be more widely supported throughout the community. The Irish  language might receive support that is much more practical and cost-effective, instead  of Sinn Fein&rsquo;s single-minded approach.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There are two types of Irish-medium schools in Northern Ireland;  there are 21 stand-alone schools, and there are 12 Irish-medium units that are  attached to English-medium host schools. The Ulster Unionist Party believes  that the most cost-effective and best way for children to gain an education  through the medium of Irish is for schools in the maintained sector to open  Irish-medium units, if they so wish.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Recently, the Minister of Education has overseen severe  cuts in the extended-schools funding, which will mean the closure of  after-school and breakfast clubs right across all school sectors. That will  affect children&rsquo;s abilities to achieve at school, and it may affect families&rsquo;  earning potential, as parents will have to look after their children for longer  periods. The education system should be focusing on developing mainstream  schools and ensuring that the best possible education is given to those who  need it most.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In focusing on independent Irish-medium schools, the  Minister will be in danger of, again, taking her eye off the ball simply in an  attempt to appease some misplaced, ideological party goal. In the past seven  years, &pound;47 million has been spent on Irish-medium education, but that &pound;47  million could have been spent much more productively elsewhere in education. We  can speculate on how much money could have been saved had independent  Irish-medium units simply been attached to existing schools.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We must also ask whether, if potentially only 12 children  in Dungannon want an independent Irish-medium primary school, they have the  right to take potential funding away from other education sectors. Their  education could be facilitated in mainstream schools. That is the crux of the  matter. Will such schools take significant finances away from other sections of  the education system in the Province and actually discriminate against  mainstream sectors?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  I will not waste time responding to Lord Morrow&rsquo;s personal attack on me, but I  wish to state, at the outset, that I submitted and signed the petition of  concern because I happen to believe in the basic principles of fairness and  common justice that Lord Morrow would like to sidestep in the debate.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">An increasing number of parents are choosing to send their  children to Irish-medium schools, just as there are parents who are choosing  the integrated sector. That choice was recognised last year in the Bain Report.  In relation to that trend, the report pointed out the Department&rsquo;s legal  obligation to cater for both forms of parental choice. The Department&rsquo;s policy  promotes respect for diversity, encourages the accommodation of different  cultural traditions, and recognises the role that all schools, including  Irish-medium schools, play in achieving those objectives.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion, in the name of the DUP, seeks to have  Irish-medium schools treated differently and, therefore, fails to recognize the  inalienable right that supporters of the Irish-medium sector have, to foster,  develop and preserve our unique language.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">An Ghaeilge is the indigenous language of the island and is  a key element of cultural identity for many people who live in Northern Ireland.  Irish-medium schools play a central role in promoting the language and should  be treated in the same way as schools in all other sectors: maintained,  controlled, integrated, or for those who choose, should there be a proven  demand in the future, Ulster Scots. Parity of esteem between the main  identities was a central part of the Good Friday Agreement and placed a  statutory duty on the Department to promote Irish-medium education in line with  integrated education.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion, in the name of the DUP representatives for  Fermanagh and South Tyrone, the constituency that I also represent, is about  the Irish-medium sector in that constituency. It makes no reference to the new Clogher Valley Integrated   Primary School, which is  presently in temporary accommodation. It is because the SDLP believes that the  same support and rights should be available to both sectors that I have tabled  a petition of concern.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Given the falling pupil numbers that have been mentioned,  and the threat to the future of so many schools, in order to respond to the  valid concerns of parents, teachers and children, we should, as elected representatives,  be working together rather than working against each other.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bain Report, which I referred to earlier, dealt to some  extent with the growing problems of the drop in school enrolments. Although I  do not agree with all the recommendations, the report did highlight that  problem and the importance of education providers, across the spectrum, making  efficient use of resources. I think that we all want to see that being done.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Options for consideration by the Irish-medium sector, as  set out in the Bain Report, include new builds and the adaptation of existing  school buildings. The report even mentions, as another option, the housing of  those facilities within the controlled sector, and similar options were  suggested for the integrated sector.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The final say on options &mdash; and I am sure few people would  disagree &mdash; should be left to the appropriate authorities; in the case of  integrated education to NICIE, and in the case of Irish Medium schools to  Comhairle na Gaelscola&iacute;ochta.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Falling pupil numbers have crystallised for governors,  parents and teachers the need for new thinking on possibilities for  collaboration and co-operation among all sectors. In their endeavours, they  deserve the support of all elected representatives in the planning of future  education provision in new ways. There is too much at stake for the future of  all our schools, and Members should not be engaging in divisive debates.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">4.15 pm</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>: The  motion raises an important issue and although it refers specifically to  Dungannon and the wider south Tyrone area, the same argument could be directed  to other areas in Northern    Ireland. The sustainable schools policy is  one of the fundamental issues on which we would like to hear the Minister&rsquo;s  views. The Alliance Party seeks an assurance from the Minister that, ideally,  all schools will be treated equally and fairly, and that no preference will be  given to any particular sector. If we receive that assurance, we will probably  oppose the motion.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The issue is not solely about the education budget; it is  about the quality of education to be delivered within that budget. Irish-medium  education enjoys parental demand and has a fine record. If the opposition is  genuinely based on budget concerns, why does the motion refer only to one  sector? In an interview on Sunday 11 May, Gregory Campbell called for parity  with Irish for the Ulster-Scots movement; presumably, he meant parity with  regard to investment. That may or may not be a good idea. I have no problem  with either movement. However, it would have a detrimental effect on the  education budget, to use the terms of the motion. Why, therefore, is the DUP so  keen on parity?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There is no disputing that &mdash; as has already been discussed  at great length in another debate today &mdash; we need to know more details about the  ministerial proposals. The case could also undoubtedly be made that the  Minister appears to have a double standard regarding Irish-medium education.  She seems to grant significantly greater leeway to Irish-medium schools than to  those in the integrated sector. If she is committed to the policy outlined in  &lsquo;Every School a Good School&rsquo;, she should be careful not to play sectors off  against one another; rather, she should treat all sectors equally.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The real irony is the position of the party that proposed the  motion. The DUP was part of the Executive that produced the Programme for  Government that, effectively, gave a blank cheque for the provision of  Irish-medium education. If the DUP is so concerned about the budgetary  implications of Irish-medium education provision, why did it not raise those  concerns at the Executive table, when the Programme for Government and the  Budget were being prepared? It did not raise those worries because a deal was  done with Sinn F&eacute;in at that time.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  The Member may have some difficulty in understanding the Programme for  Government and the PSA targets therein. Will he accept that PSA 10, objective 4,  of the Programme for Government &mdash; referred to by Michelle O&rsquo;Neill &mdash; could  reflect Irish-medium units and not necessarily Irish-medium schools?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>: I  seem to have missed the point of that intervention. I will let the Member have  another go if she wants.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  I will have another go. This motion is about an Irish-medium school &mdash; a new building,  an opening. That is what we are against. The PSA targets can deal with units in  existing schools.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>A Member</strong>:  Has the Member got it now?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lunn</strong>: I  have got it, but I will not respond.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The point that I was making is that this is a good example  of the deals that were done between the two parties to get the Programme for  Government through. Therefore, there is no use crying about it now.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We are supporters of the Irish language &mdash; and, probably, of  the Ulster-Scots movement &mdash; but also of a realistic, responsible sustainable  schools policy. If the Minister can give us assurances on the latter, we will  oppose the motion; failing that, we will probably abstain.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  I congratulate my party colleagues Lord Morrow and Arlene Foster for proposing  this motion. I do not understand some of the comments made by the Member who  has just spoken. If a deal had been done between Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP, why  would the DUP bring forward a motion opposing it? That does not even come close  to common sense.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion calls on the Minister of Education to abandon  proposals to establish Irish-medium primary and post-primary schools in  Dungannon and the wider south Tyrone area. As the proposed post-primary college  is to be based in Cookstown in my constituency; I feel that I must raise my  concerns about this blatant attempt to sectarianise our education system.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not object to anyone who wants to speak this foreign  Irish language. However, I do object to proposals to fund Irish-medium schools  in Northern Ireland,  especially when there are also proposals to close schools, many of which are in  rural areas.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Together with other elected representatives, I am due to  meet with the Minister regarding the proposed closure of Maghera High School,  which has around 150 pupils: yet, the opening of another school for the Irish-medium  sector with fewer pupils is being considered. That is a total disgrace, and I  hope that the Minister will accept the need for Maghera High School  to remain open to meet the needs of the local community. If the same time and  money were spent on bolstering our education system as is being spent on the  Irish-medium sector, there would be no need for that sector to exist, because  those maintained schools that chose to teach Irish would be able to satisfy  that need.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Much has been said about the need for Irish-medium schools  in Northern Ireland,  but &mdash; unless I have missed something &mdash; we live in a country in which the mother  tongue is the Queen&rsquo;s English. Moreover, it is also the main spoken language in  the Irish Republic: Irish is spoken in everyday  conversation only in small parts of the west coast of that country.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">To whom will the pupils of Irish-medium schools speak?  There is no town or village in the whole of Northern Ireland in which the  people speak Irish as their first language. The Irish language is a minority  language. I have no problem with people learning or speaking it, but I do have  one with its politicisation, which is what is happening in the debate.  Irish-language schools should not be prioritised in the way that they have  been. Only a very small number of young people want to learn Irish, because it  offers them no benefit.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As a young person, I had no choice but to learn GCSE  French. I had no desire to do so because I felt that it would not benefit me. However,  I accept that there is a distinct difference between a language that is  understood by many people across the world and one that is understood by only a  small number of people in Northern Ireland  and the Irish Republic. Unless I am mistaken, the money  spent on teaching me the little French that I learnt was better spent than the  expenditure proposed on the Irish-medium sector.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Not many people who learn Irish at school go on to use it  in daily life. Patsy McGlone my constituency colleague is a fluent Irish  speaker &mdash; at least I think he is, because I do not understand him when he  speaks Irish. I respect his right to speak Irish, but I am sure that he will  agree that it is not his everyday language. It is evident that many Sinn F&eacute;in  Members stutter and stammer when they try to speak in Irish. That demon&shy;strates  that their interest in the language is purely political, and for that reason,  their speaking it is offensive to many in the unionist tradition.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Irish-medium schools are nothing more than a drain on  public money, which must not be allowed to continue. I therefore support the  motion.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Merci beaucoup.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. The debate has been most  interesting. Ian McCrea has just spoken about how the Irish language is being  politicised &mdash; that is so, but it is being politicised by the DUP. It is  regrettable that the motion has been tabled, for it is discriminatory. It is  especially regrettable that a ministerial colleague has put her name to that motion.  It is incumbent upon me, as MP for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, to represent all  the people of my constituency. It is hugely regrettable that an elected  representative should consider that she can exclude the Irish-medium education  sector from her duty to represent.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I also wish to express an interest. I am a parent of a  child who attended the na&iacute;scoil in Dungannon. My child was not able to progress  to rang a haon because there was no Irish language provision in the town. I  wanted my child to attend an Irish-medium educational establishment. It is  hugely enriching for children to learn in Irish; it gives them an opportunity  to have different ways of looking at the world and it broadens their horizons.  A child who is taught bilingually has a much richer educational experience than  one taught monolingually. That is also true of children who are taught through  the medium of Irish.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, it was of great regret to me that my child was  not able to go through Irish-medium education. I feel that, as a parent, my  choice was not able to be fulfilled. I feel quite emotional about the issue of  the Irish language and about the development of the Irish-medium sector in my  constituency and across the island   of Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We have been very lucky to have been set some very good  examples. Michelle O&rsquo;Neill talked about Gaelscoil U&iacute; N&eacute;ill, with which I am  familiar. There is a new Irish-medium school in Lisnaskea, which is also doing  extremely well. It is regrettable that this motion has been tabled at this time  and in such a discriminatory way.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As I have already mentioned, Coalisland has the closest  Irish-medium provision for children in Dungannon. If children from Dungannon  were to travel to Coalisland, they would require a new teacher and the cost  would be the same. Therefore, I am not sure why those who have tabled the  motion are getting so exercised about the cost to the public purse.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, long-term unfilled places are a difficulty only  experienced by English-medium schools in that area. The Department of Education  has a duty to facilitate and encourage Irish-medium education, where there is  an appropriate demand. As Irish-medium schooling cannot be catered for in a  classroom where instruction is through the medium of English, there is no other  option but to establish Irish-medium provision. The fact that there may be  long-term unfilled places in schools that instruct through the medium of  English should not impact on Irish-medium education as a parental choice.  However, that is the case in Dungannon.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It has been determined by the Department of Education since  the Good Friday Agreement that P1 stand-alone school enrolment &mdash; in accordance  with EU guidelines on approval for grant-aided schools &mdash; should be  self-sustainable. That means that Irish-medium provision would not have a  negative impact on the education budget.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, the approach taken by the Department of  Education to grant-aided approval is economically sound. It places the onus on  the school to prove its sustainability with little risk to the Department or  the taxpayer because the Department cannot make a commitment until the school  proves its long-term viability.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is regrettable that we are having this debate, and the  same would apply to post-primary Irish-medium education. I agree with much of  what has been said by Michelle O&rsquo;Neill and Tommy Gallagher about Irish-medium  provision. If a language cannot grow and develop in its own country, where can  it develop?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not know whether the DUP is aware that there is an  Irish-language unit at Harvard   University. Indeed, there  are many examples of such units across the globe. Many people who may not have  any connection with Ireland  are taught the Irish language.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is incumbent on us to protect the Irish language and to  encourage it to grow. Bearing in mind young people who have the opportunity to  learn in the Irish medium, it is hugely regrettable that anyone would try &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Gildernew</strong>:  No, I will not. It is hugely regrettable that anyone would get in the way of  that &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Miss McIlveen</strong>:  At a time when there are so many unfilled places in schools in Northern Ireland,  it is quite reckless of the Minister to continue with proposals to provide  grant aid to more Irish-medium schools. I know that Sinn F&eacute;in, et al, have  lodged a petition of concern in respect of the motion.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Setting aside my &mdash; by now &mdash; well-known opinion of the  Minister&rsquo;s obsession with the Irish-medium sector, it is nonsense to press  ahead with the opening of such schools in the absence of a full investigation  into area-based planning. The draft terms of reference for area-based planning  are under consultation, and we have been seeking those terms of reference since  the Minister made her statement on this matter in March.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I would have thought that a ministerial statement would  imply some form of progress, but that invariably is not the case with this  Minister. When she made her statement on 4 March, I asked her what the terms of  reference were. However, unfortunately, I received no answer. Therefore, I  tabled a question on 7 March, and I am still awaiting her answer, 67 days  later.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">One would think that I and my colleagues on the Education  Committee would have been given the opportunity to provide some input into the  drafting of those terms of reference &mdash; or at least given a chance to comment on  them.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, as usual, the Minister seems intent on treating  all of us with such a level of contempt and discourtesy as truly beggars  belief. Concern is heightened because the terms of reference have still not  been agreed 70 days after the Minister made her statement. At least the  Minister cannot lay the blame on the Committee.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">4.30 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">If Members cast their minds back to 4 March, they will  recall that the Minister said that the area-based assessment was to be  completed by October. Subsequently, it was to be consulted upon, and that  consultation was to be completed by January 2009. Even if the terms of  reference were settled today, there would be only five months to make the  assessment. They will not be settled today, and, once again, we face the  prospect of the Education Minister letting slip something that is of critical  importance, which, again, will result in confusion and concern.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">All Members should know that area-based planning is the  linchpin of the Minister&rsquo;s plans, but she is allowing development to take place  without that assessment being made and without reference to an area-based planning  assessment. How can she do that? It is another example of her favouring one  sector. Continuation in that manner flies in the face of everything that the  Bain Report is about.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">My colleague Lord Morrow said that there are 50,000 surplus  places in schools throughout Northern    Ireland, and it is anticipated that there  will be a further 30,000 in the next 10 years. Despite that, the Minister is  making the problem worse by opening more schools &mdash; regardless of the type. At a  time when the schools estate should be rationalised, it is sheer folly and  recklessness to be wasting public money in that way, and, given the utilisation  of the club-bank scheme, it is also inequitable.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We must not forget the large number of Irish-medium schools  in which the enrolment figures remain below the recommended Bain thresholds. As  I said in a previous debate, chapter 9 of the Bain Report, &lsquo;Planning: a  strategic approach&rsquo;, recommends area-based planning and states that the  Department of Education should proceed with it until the education and skills  authority is established. It also states that:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;future school building projects should only be  approved after area-based planning is established&rdquo;.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">It is also worth highlighting the cost implications  of establishing new Irish-medium schools. Schools with 50 pupils cost 200% more  than average schools, and that rises to 300% when there are fewer than 20  pupils. However, Irish-medium schools with less than 20 pupils are continuing  to receive funding. The impact of that on an already tight education budget is  obvious. I can think of many other worthy projects on which that money could be  spent and which would be of benefit to all sides of the community.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister is pressing ahead with the proposal to establish  an Irish-medium primary school in Dungannon without knowing how many pupils  there will be or assessing the budget. The school&rsquo;s proposed opening date of 1  September 2008 epitomises recklessness. Sinn F&eacute;in should be concerned, but not  about the motion; it should be more concerned about the policies of its  Minister.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. N&iacute;l aon amhras faoi, a LeasCheann  Comhairle, ach go bhfuil &eacute;ileamh an-mh&oacute;r ar oideachas tr&iacute; mhe&aacute;n na Gaeilge,  agus t&aacute; s&eacute; de dhualgas de r&eacute;ir dl&iacute; ar an Roinn Oideachais an t-&eacute;ileamh sin a  sh&aacute;samh.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a considerable demand for Irish-medium education  in Northern Ireland,  and the Department of Education is legally bound to provide for that demand. It  is not the Department or the Minister who plan the development of Irish-medium  education in County   Tyrone or anywhere else;  development is driven by local demand from parents who want their children to  be educated through the medium of Irish. That demand is factored into the  overall development of Irish-medium education by Comhairle na Gaelscola&iacute;ochta.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department of Education is obliged to support any  school that meets its criteria. Any school that does not meet the Department&rsquo;s  criteria will not gain recognition. Neither the Minister nor the Department  have the power to abide by this motion and abandon any viable proposal for a  school in any sector that meets the Department&rsquo;s criteria.</p>

		    <p class="B3BodyText">Since 1996, there has been an Irish-medium pre-school  committee in Dungannon working on the development of Irish-medium education in  that town.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">T&aacute; s&eacute; i gceist ag an choiste &aacute;iti&uacute;l bunscoil a bhun&uacute; m&aacute;  bh&iacute;onn go leor p&aacute;ist&iacute; acu le crit&eacute;ir na Roinne a sh&aacute;samh; mura mb&iacute;onn, n&iacute;  chuirfear an scoil ar bun.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The intention of that committee is to establish an  Irish-medium primary school if there is a sufficient number of children to  fulfil the Department of Education&rsquo;s criteria. If there is not a sufficient  number, the school will not be set up.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">At the moment, Coalisland is the nearest provider of  Irish-medium education for people who live in Dungannon. Irish-medium education  is not offered in any primary school in Dungannon. If a new school is not  provided for the children attending the Irish-medium pre-school in Dungannon,  they will attend Gaelscoil U&iacute; N&eacute;ill in Coalisland. Therefore, those children  will not impact on existing primary schools in any part of the Dungannon area.  At present, there are no surplus places in the Irish-medium school in  Coalisland. If the children from Dungannon have to attend the school in  Coalisland, an extra teacher will be needed there; however, that is hardly a  huge expense.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">According to Comhairle na Gaelscola&iacute;ochta the local  committee is being advised by Cookstown District Council that post-primary  Irish-medium education in Cookstown will be provided initially in the form of a  unit in an existing school. If anything, that will strengthen a local school,  rather than threaten it.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is clear that the motion is misguided, and that the  development of Irish-medium education in Dungannon and South Tyrone poses no  threat to any other sector. The Assembly should be concerned about the number  of long-term unfilled places in schools and the threat presented by falling  rolls. However, the way to deal with that problem is not to attack other  sectors, but to consider creative solutions that will help to ensure the  survival of those schools, whether they are urban schools or small, rural  schools. Schools would be better served by the House working in unity to solve  the problems caused by falling rolls. The SDLP is ready and willing to engage  in that work and I hope that other parties are so inclined.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">T&aacute; c&uacute;pla bomaite f&aacute;gtha agam.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I have a few minutes left, and I want to take the  opportunity to congratulate the Irish-medium sector on the amazing progress  that it has made since the foundation of the first Irish-medium school in Belfast in 1971.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  It is a story of hard work and &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order &mdash; the Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat. Most of the arguments have been covered in the course  of the debate. I want to touch on the point that Dominic Bradley made about the  legal requirement for the Department of Education to provide Irish-medium  education. Therefore, today&rsquo;s motion, regardless of whether it is passed &mdash; and  the petition of concern will ensure that it is not passed &mdash; has no authority  whatsoever.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The parties on the Benches opposite &mdash; that is, the DUP and  the Ulster Unionist Party &mdash; have claimed that the motion is not discriminatory  against the Irish language. However, having listened to the debate, I can say that  it is nothing other than discriminatory. That is unfortunate, because those  parties understand neither the history of the language nor the movement that  ensured that the language is alive today. Most of that movement was made up of  Presbyterians from Belfast,  who ensured that the Irish language is thriving. Many parents want their  children educated in it. Therefore, whether we consider the provision of an  Irish-language school in Dungannon, Belfast  or in my own area of Lurgan, there is a requirement for that because there is a  demand for it.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I recently visited the National Assembly for Wales in Cardiff,  and I had a lengthy meeting with a senior Welsh Conservative. During that  meeting, we discussed many issues, including language. Welsh Conservatives are  unionists &mdash; they believe in the union between Wales  and Britain,  and their politics are more aligned to those of the DUP and the Ulster Unionist  Party than they are to mine. I had an enlightening conversation with that  member about the use of both the Welsh and the Irish languages.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  I thank the Member for giving way. Does he ever ask himself why unionists, in  particular, are not endeared to the Irish language? Is there a remote  possibility that Sinn F&eacute;in has politicised the Irish language in Northern Ireland?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>: I  will address that point later.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">That member told me that 10 years ago at a Welsh  Conservative Party conference, someone would have been booed off the stage for  speaking Welsh. However, delegates are now expected to speak at least some  Welsh in their contributions. That is a measure of how far the Welsh language  has progressed. The hostility that existed 10 or 14 years ago is beginning to  evaporate. The Welsh-medium sector is now thriving &mdash; small schools that have  been set up in villages, rural areas and towns across Wales are  flourishing because parents want their children to be educated through that  medium.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Morrow asked why unionism is so hostile to the Irish  language. That is a question that he also has a responsibility to answer. He  should not say that just because Sinn F&eacute;in is pro-Irish language, the DUP will  be hostile to it. That is the politics of negativity, and it does not make  sense. I do not approach an issue and say that just because the DUP supports  it, I will oppose it. Any issue should be thought through, and its merits  should be considered.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Were I to sit on the unionist Benches, and if I wanted to  call Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s bluff, I would take ownership of the Irish language, I would  learn and speak it, and I would get involved with the sector. Unionists should  not be negative about Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s involvement with the Irish language.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The issue is related to the previous debate. It is not a  Sinn F&eacute;in conspiracy; Sinn F&eacute;in is not responsible for ensuring that the Irish  language thrives. We have played our part in it, it is part of our manifesto,  and we will continue to pursue it. The SDLP supports it, and thousands of  people who have no political allegiance send their children to Irish-medium  schools. They want to continue to do so, not because of some sort of political  plot against the Democratic Unionist Party or the Ulster Unionist Party, but  because they have a passion for the language. Unionists should not fear the  language; they should learn about it. I do not mean that they should understand  the words; rather, they should try to understand what the language is about.  Doing so would demystify the issue for them.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Clarification of the motion is required. Are the proposers  opposed to Irish-language provision in Dungannon, or are they opposed to the  provision of a school in Dungannon? My understanding is that there are no  concrete proposals for a school in Dungannon. There is a request for  Irish-medium provision in Dungannon, which is completely different.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I echo my colleague Michelle O&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s comments. I am  disappointed that Arlene Foster &mdash; who, no matter how she tries to separate her  roles, is the Minister of the Environment &mdash; can afford to spend two hours and  30 minutes in the Chamber debating a discriminatory motion when there is more  important work to be done in her Department.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>: I  am out of time, so I am finished.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>: I  support the motion, and I thank my colleagues Lord Morrow and Arlene Foster for  tabling it.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to place on record our sadness that the SDLP tabled  a petition of concern. It is sad that Mr Gallagher, whether the instigator or  the fall guy, has grasped the wrong end of the stick. He has twisted the  situation out of context for party political gain. He stated that the DUP is  trying to turn the clock back, and he said that all elected representatives  have a responsibility to show leadership and to adopt a positive approach to  education issues. The Member should apply his own rules. By clouding the  argument, he is defaulting on his duty to his constituency to fight for the  sustainability of rural schools in the controlled, maintained and integrated  sectors.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">4.45 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Members who signed the petition of concern were wrongly  advised. The DUP does not attempt, and has never attempted, to deny parental  choice in education. It does, however, believe in fair play. It believes that  there should be equality on the issue, but the Minister is not giving us that  equality.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  The Member raised the matter of fair play. I mentioned fairness in my  contribution, and I am keen to see the preservation of all our schools and the  development of the four sectors: controlled; maintained; integrated; and Irish  medium. That is a fair basis, but the Member said that Irish-medium schools should  be excluded in order to concentrate on integrated, controlled and maintained  schools. That is not fair.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  The comments from John O&rsquo;Dowd and Tommy Gallagher demonstrate that they do not  understand the DUP position. This is not about the eradication of the  Irish-medium sector. Remember that, each year, &pound;20 million is spent on the  Irish-medium sector in Northern    Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Dominic Bradley said that that system has been in existence  in Northern Ireland  since 1971. It is 2008, so one would assume that the Irish-medium sector would  be a large, thriving school estate that would vastly increased in numbers in  the intervening years. However, Irish-medium schools have experienced no more  of an increase than other sectors have, even the integrated sector. We need,  therefore, to keep our feet on the ground. When considering the importance of  the Irish language, the Irish   Republic &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  Yes.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Is the Member aware that statistics demonstrate that the fastest-growing  education sector in Northern    Ireland is the Irish-medium sector?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>: I  doubt that that is the case, given the small number of schools that we have in Northern Ireland.  However, it costs &pound;20 million a year to run those schools.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In the Irish   Republic, a vote was held  in Dingle. That is a tourist attraction, and a place that seeks to use the  Irish language. There was a lobby to change the name, and this is probably the  only Irish that I know, to An Daingean. Did the people of Dingle decide to go  down that road? No, they decided to retain the English name.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Those on the opposite Benches continually rehearse the  argument that, somehow, the DUP is against the Irish language. I shall make it  abundantly clear that that is not the case. In my study at home, I have a book  &mdash; a Protestant catechism in Irish &mdash; that was given to me by &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v&rsquo;s  father, who was a lecturer at Trinity College, Dublin.  It is of absolutely no value to me other than that it was given to me as a  gift. I need &Eacute;amon to translate it so that I might understand exactly what it  says.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">This debate is not an attack on the Irish-medium sector &mdash;  it is about fairness. On 4 March 2008, the Minister told us that she would  introduce a new sustainable-schools policy. We are still waiting to witness  that.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  The Minister makes many promises.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  Lord Morrow is absolutely right &mdash; the Minister has made a vast array of  promises but has delivered nothing. However, when it comes to assisting the  Irish-medium sector, the Minister is the first person out of the blocks. She  will spend all her time, effort and energy in assisting that sector. She  attended a conference in Dublin  and spent most of her time speaking in Irish. Some people at that conference  decided that they had had enough and left. They were not there to hear the  Minister speak in Irish but to hear the issues being addressed.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">My honourable friend Lord Morrow is absolutely right &mdash;  Members are in this position because Sinn F&eacute;in has politicised the Irish  language.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education (Ms Ruane)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat. Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an deis seo  labhairt faoi Ghaelscoileanna, n&oacute; is cuid luachmhar d&aacute;r gc&oacute;ras oideachais iad.

T&aacute; r&uacute;n  agam a chinnti&uacute; go gcomhl&iacute;ontar an d&aacute; dhualgas seo.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the opportunity to speak about Irish-medium  schools, which are a valuable part of our educational landscape. Following a  commitment in the Good Friday Agreement, a statutory duty was placed on my  Department to encourage and facilitate Irish-medium education. In addition, the  European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, which came into force in  July 2001, contains a commitment to education in the Irish language where the  numbers are considered sufficient. I intend to ensure that both of those  obligations are fulfilled.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Irish language is one of Europe&rsquo;s  oldest indigenous languages. It is a common heritage for all the people of this  island &mdash; the island   of Ireland. The  resurgence of the Irish language, particularly in the North but throughout the  island, is a tribute to families, parents, teachers and Irish-language  activists. I praise the work of Comhairle na Gaelscola&iacute;ochta and Iontaobhas na  Gaelscola&iacute;ochta on this subject.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The issue of Irish-language rights provides everyone with  the unique opportunity to demonstrate real leadership and a willingness to  embrace their neighbours who wish to use the Irish language. For example, many  Presbyterians are proud of the role that Irish speakers from their Church have  played in the preservation and development of the language. I hope to see a  future where, once again, many more Presbyterians play a role. I was invited  recently to an event in the Presbyterian Church about Presbyterians and the  Irish language. I attended, and it was a wonderful event.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">People from all faiths and none celebrate our language,  along with those that were born in our country and those who have chosen to  live here.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Agus n&iacute; amh&aacute;in Preisbit&eacute;irigh, ach daoine &oacute; gach aon  chreideamh agus daoine gan chreideamh; daoine a rugadh anseo agus na  nua-&Eacute;ireannaigh.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Recently, I was in Cult&uacute;rlann McAdam &Oacute; Fiaich, which was  founded by a Presbyterian Minister. It is part of the Gaeltacht quarter. People  made reference to the fact that the west coast of Ireland is the only Gaeltacht of  Ireland. There is a Gaeltacht in west Belfast,  and it is a Gaeltacht quarter. I was with people from the New York  Comptroller&rsquo;s Office in the Irish-language centre, and they saw the vibrancy  and dynamism of the Gaeltacht &mdash; the cultural quarter.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Irish-medium education is a distinctive part of the  education system and it aims to provide a range of vibrant settings, meeting  the educational and linguistic needs of pupils. It is much more than simply  English-medium education delivered through the Irish language. The desired  outcome &mdash; high-quality education for children who are bilingual and who leave  school competent and confident &mdash; is important at a time when value-added as a  concept includes more than purely finance-related considerations. The enriching  experience of having developed bilingualism provides an additional resource  upon which those children can draw as they move forward in their lives.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">More children and their parents are seeking the benefits of  the Irish-medium experience. The Irish-medium sector is the fastest-growing  sector in education here. The number of children receiving an Irish-medium  education has increased by more than 10% in the past three years. Today, almost  3,400 pupils attend 34 grant-aided Irish-medium schools and units attached to  English-medium schools. Those figures do not take into account the children who  do not have a post-primary, Irish-medium school to go to. It is also a dynamic  sector in the South of Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Such development has not taken place without significant  contributions and sacrifices from children and parents alike. Despite that  dedication, the sector faces serious problems as regards facilities and support  structures because of systematic neglect since the foundation of Irish-medium  schools. That position was recognised by George Bain in the strategic review of  education, which recommended that there should be a comprehensive and coherent  policy for Irish-medium education.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As a result of that recommendation, my Department has been  undertaking a wide-ranging review of its policies on Irish-medium education.  The review addresses legacy issues facing the sector and sets it on a more sustainable  and equitable footing. Although I appreciate that it is not yet the case in the  controlled sector, I also believe that learning Irish at an English-medium  school provides a bridge to a more inclusive future. I have been delighted on  many occasions, when visiting schools in the controlled sector, to have been  greeted by children and their teachers in Irish. It happened to me last week on  one of my visits. I would like to thank those schools for the generosity that  they have shown; it is in stark contrast to the lack of generosity in the  motion.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I appreciate the open-minded approach of all those schools,  and their generosity of spirit to the Irish language. I hope that some day  Irish will be taught in all schools here, and that its cultural benefits will  be available to every child as they want it.</p>

		    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion relates to two specific development proposals  for schools in Dungannon and Cookstown. There is a statutory requirement for a  development proposal to be published when a school is being newly established,  being closed, or undergoing a significant change that alters its character or  size. Proposals can be initiated by the education and library boards, the  Council for Catholic Maintained Schools, the Council for Integrated Education, <span style="font-size:11.0pt; ">Comhairle Na  Gaelscola&iacute;ochta, an individual school, or other interested parties. It is important  to remember that I do not initiate development proposals.</span></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText"><span style="font-size:11.0pt; ">In this instance, the Southern Education and Library Board published  two development proposals, relating to Irish-medium schools in Dungannon and  the wider south Tyrone area, on 14 April. The proposals have been published at  the request of the boards of governors of the respective schools. The proposals  are to award grant-aided status to Col&aacute;iste Speir&iacute;n&iacute;, which opened as an  independent school in Cookstown on 3 September 2007, and to establish a new  grant-aided Irish-medium primary school in Dungannon, to be known as </span>Bunscoil  U&iacute; Chl&eacute;irigh<span style="font-size:11.0pt; ">,  from 1 September 2008.</span></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText"><span style="font-size:11.0pt; ">Publication of a development proposal initiates a two-month period  during which the public may send comments or objections to my Department. As  soon as possible after that period, my officials will assemble all the relevant  facts and pass them to me to decide on the proposals</span></p>

		    <p class="B3BodyText"><span style="font-size:11.0pt; ">All development proposals are considered on their individual merits,  and proposals for new schools are considered in relation to a common set of  viability criteria. Once a proposal is published, the process requires that a  decision be taken.

		    <p class="B3BodyText"><span style="font-size:11.0pt; ">The consultations on the two current proposals will end in mid-June. I  will take decisions as soon as possible thereafter, in light of the relevant  factors in each case and the comments that have been made during the  consultation. I hope that people understand that I have been fair in relation  to Irish-medium and integrated education. My Department has a statutory duty;  there is no favourable treatment. All that is happening at the moment is that  the Irish-medium and integrated sectors are being treated in a fair and  equitable manner. Go raibh maith agat.</span></p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker; danke sch&ouml;n, merci, go raibh maith agat, a  LeasCheann Comhairle. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I thought that that would get a reaction.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In reply to a point made by John O&rsquo;Dowd, I want to refer  him to the development proposals that are mentioned in the motion. They talk  about the creation of new buildings, and that is the issue surrounding this  motion.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to be very clear, because Trevor Lunn and others  have been confused about the motion, which Lord Morrow and I tabled after we  were lobbied by a small controlled school in the South Tyrone area. Staff at  that school were, and remain, concerned by the huge number of school closures  in South Tyrone and Fermanagh.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">5.00 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Michelle O&rsquo;Neill and John O&rsquo;Dowd should know that, whatever  my ministerial role, I will always represent the constituents of Fermanagh and  South Tyrone. They might find that a difficulty, but I want to put on record  that I consider my role as a constituency MLA just as important as my role as a  Minister in the Executive.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In moving the motion, Lord Morrow said that it was not  clear how many pupils would take up places in the new school buildings that are  proposed for September 2008. He raised the issue of equality and said that that  might be tested in another place. I regret to say that that will probably be  the case. Lord Morrow also said that the review of Irish-medium education would  not be completed until the end of May 2008, yet we are pushing ahead with  development proposals for two new school buildings.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Sammy Wilson raised the issue of the quality of education  that is being provided in the schools in question, and mentioned concerns  raised by inspection reports. That should concern the Minister of Education, if  she is interested in the provision of Irish-medium schooling.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The issue is how to deal with the huge number of empty  desks at schools, and Fermanagh and South Tyrone have their share of them.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Michelle O&rsquo;Neill talked about the Irish language as a  native language. We are all entitled to our opinion, but how does opening new  schools, when there are so many earmarked for closure in Fermanagh and South  Tyrone, fit into a shared future? Most, if not all, CCMS schools teach Irish  already, and provision exists to set up Irish-medium units in those schools,  yet we are told that new buildings are needed to do that. At the same time,  many other schools in Fermanagh and South Tyrone struggle to get the go-ahead  for their new buildings.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">That brings me to the subject of Devenish College  in Enniskillen, which has been waiting for a long time for its new build. The  school is trying to do the best that it can with what it has. The Minister  should visit Devenish   College to see how it has  coped since the closure of the Duke of Westminster School in Ballinamallard,  which was accepted by her as a development proposal.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister knows, and my colleague Lord Morrow can  testify, that Dungannon   Primary School makes  great provision for a large ethnic minority in the Dungannon area. I am amazed  that buildings for Irish-medium schools are being given the go-ahead when  finance is needed by schools that make such excellent provision.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Michelle O&rsquo;Neill went on to say that Irish-medium schools  are filling a gap in the school education system. That raises a question: where  are those children at this moment? If they are not at school, social services  may want to know why.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We heard about rights for the Irish medium, but absolutely  nothing about responsibilities &mdash; but that is the norm for Sinn F&eacute;in. Mrs  O&rsquo;Neill said that she would support the development of schools.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Tom Elliott supported the motion. Francie Brolly made the  same argument as I did when he said that there is absolutely no need to build  new schools. I could not agree with him more. It is much more cost-effective to  deal with the proposals by utilising units of existing schools. We also heard  from Tom Elliott about the extended schools cuts.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The MP for Fermanagh and South Tyrone, Michelle Gildernew,  told us how emotional she was about the provision of Irish-medium schools in  her constituency. I can tell her that I am emotional about the Minister&rsquo;s  extended schools cuts in Fermanagh and South Tyrone that mean that many  children there have lost their after-schools clubs.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I must say that I have not heard the Minister of Agriculture  &mdash; the MP for Fermanagh and South Tyrone &mdash; raise her voice to object to that.  She tells us that she is the MP for the entire constituency of Fermanagh and  South Tyrone. Therefore, I look forward to her comments on that issue.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Tommy Gallagher explained why he put down a petition of  concern: he believes that it is in the interests of fairness and common  justice. I look forward to his support when the people in the controlled sector  who have been discriminated against take their case to another place.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As I said at the beginning of my contribution, I am not  against anyone&rsquo;s learning the Irish language. Every year, thousands of people  do so through CCMS. However, I am against the Department of Education ploughing  money and resources into newbuild schools that may only have a handful of  pupils, while on the other hand it is adamant, through the board, that it will  close schools in my constituency that may well, as is the case at Carntall  Primary School, have more pupils that they are allowed to admit because they  are deemed too small by the board. Meanwhile, new schools are being opened with  as few as 17 pupils.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Trevor Lunn discussed sustainable schools and said that he  sought an answer from the Minister on whether all schools would be treated  fairly and equally. He said that, otherwise, he would not vote against the  motion. I hope that Mr Lunn listened carefully, because he did not get an  answer on that issue.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Ian McCrea talked about how Maghera High School  is under threat from the Department and referred to his constituency colleague  Pasty McGlone, who, as Chairperson of the Environment Committee, has never once  misused the Irish language to me as Minister of the Environment. I pay tribute  to him for that, because there are other Members in the Chamber who politicise  the Irish language. That is the fault of those who sit on the opposite Benches.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As I have said, Michelle Gildernew told the House that the  motion is discriminatory. I am disappointed that, when controlled-sector  schools are being closed across her constituency, I do not hear her voice being  raised for the children who, as a result, must travel many miles to get to  their nearest school.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Michelle McIlveen talked about the reckless nature of the  Minister&rsquo;s proposals and stressed that there was a need to consider area-based  planning as the key to making progress. She acknowledged that the Minister  favours the Irish sector. Dominic Bradley told the House that the Education  Department is legally bound to provide Irish-medium education. I have no  difficulty with that. However, it could be done through units, rather than  through the provision of new schools with the associated capital costs.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">During the debate on post-primary transfer, Mr Bradley talked  a lot about sustainability, although &mdash; understand&shy;ably, when one considers his  standpoint &mdash; the House did not hear much from him about sustainability with regard  to this motion. Children who must travel to from Dungannon to Coalisland for  Irish-medium education do not have half as long a journey as children in  Fermanagh and South Tyrone will have to get to their nearest controlled school  when all of the schools in that sector have been closed.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">John O&rsquo;Dowd also referred to the legal requirement on Irish-medium  education. He then went on to say that the motion would have no effect, which  bemused me. If that is the case, what is the need for a petition of concern?  There we are, Mr Deputy Speaker. He discussed the Presbyterian Church&rsquo;s role in  the Irish language. I thank God once again that I am an Anglican. He also  mentioned the Welsh Conservatives and referred to the argument about the use of  language as a political tool. He said that we should not fear the language: I  do not. That is specifically why I used that small bit of Irish that I have  picked up from the other side of the House during the past year. However, I  will not allow the children of Fermanagh and South Tyrone to be treated as  second-class citizens, which is what is happening at present.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mervyn Storey debunked many of the myths that surround the  issue. He said that the motion is about fairness. I firmly believe that it is  about providing fairness for all of the children whom the Minister talks about  from time to time. I want my three children to have the best possible education  in Fermanagh and South Tyrone. I know that the Minister will understand that.  However, I ask her to rethink her proposals.</p>

		    <p class="H5StageHeading"><a name="6"></a>Sustainable Energy</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Minister of Enterprise,  Trade and Investment has written to advise me that he is unavoidably absent due  to diary commitments. He regrets that he is not able to respond to the motion,  and he has arranged for the Minister of the Environment, Mrs Arlene Foster, to  respond on his behalf.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour  and 30 minutes for the debate. The proposer of the motion will have 10 minutes  to propose and 10 minutes to make a winding-up speech. All other Members who  are called to speak will have five minutes. One amendment has been selected and  published on the Marshalled List. The proposer of the amendment will have 10  minutes to propose and five minutes to make a winding-up speech.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly notes the recommendations in the review of  the Sustainable Energy Market; and calls on the Executive to ensure that there  is closer co-operation between different Departments to ensure that sustainable  energy, including renewable energy, is developed in such a way that benefits  the environment, and tackles the socio-economic problems that face families due  to fuel poverty.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I support the  motion and the amendment. Although the motion was tabled before the recent  increase in oil prices, the subsequent rise in gas prices and the anticipated  rise in electricity prices, given the rising energy demand, the case already  existed for the Government to reassess their options in relation to meeting  their targets for reducing carbon emissions, and increasing energy efficiency  and renewable energy usage. Those factors must be considered in the context of  benefiting the environment, tackling climate change and combating the ongoing  misery faced by people who live in fuel poverty.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Climate change issues constitute a debate in themselves.  Therefore, I will only mention them briefly. There are strong moral, economic,  social and environmental reasons why Ireland and, indeed, all countries  must sign up to cutting global emissions. We are all aware of how climate  change already destroys the lives and livelihoods of many of the poorest and  most vulnerable people in the world, and, as global temperatures rise further,  that trend is set to continue. Climate change is a major threat to development  and to the progress that has been made in fighting poverty in poorer countries.  Unless countries, including Ireland,  sign up to the targets required to reduce global emissions, they will be  responsible for subjecting the world&rsquo;s poor to greater vulnerability to  disease, hunger and exploitation.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Although the review of the sustainable energy market found  that efforts by stakeholders and delivery organisations have gone some way to  improving energy efficiency and increasing the use of renewables, there are  still opportunities and potential for further improvements. For instance, the  electricity-generation fuel mix has changed, and continues to change, rapidly,  and large-scale renewable energy resources are in operation, including  onshore-wind- and wave-generated electricity and biomass; however, there is  still no large-scale generation using offshore wind, solar or waste resources.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In the North, the domestic sector is still the largest  energy user, followed by the industrial, commercial and public sectors.  Furthermore, barriers to small-scale renewable energy generation must still be  overcome, particularly barriers to ensuring the motivation and financial  support for increasing uptake in private households.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">That must be accompanied by raising awareness of  energy-efficiency measures.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Once again, there has been a sharp rise in fuel prices; oil  prices have soared, and the recent announcement by Phoenix Gas that it has  increased prices by 28% has put low-income households at crisis point. One in three  households in the North of Ireland is experiencing fuel poverty; the cost of  living is rising, and people are paying more for energy in spite of earning  lower than average wages. As people struggle to meet rising food bills and fuel  costs, they are being told to expect another rise in the cost of electricity.  It has been estimated that 42% of the population in the North of Ireland will  soon be living in fuel poverty.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Households on low incomes and houses with poor energy  efficiency and high energy costs create fuel poverty. However, fuel poverty  does not exist in a vacuum: it is exacerbated by other forms of poverty and  social and economic disadvantage. Pensioners; people with disabilities, and  families with young children or who are on low incomes are most vulnerable and  face the choice between heating their homes and putting food on their tables.  More people are getting themselves into debt and some are losing their homes  because they have not been able to keep up with increases in mortgage repayments.  In my West Belfast constituency, I know people with young families who have had  their homes repossessed and have had to live in cramped and overcrowded living  conditions with other family members while they wait, on the social housing  list, to be rehoused.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Through the Programme for Government and the fuel-poverty  strategy, the Executive have set targets to eliminate fuel poverty in  vulnerable households by 2010 and in non-vulnerable households by 2016. It is  important that there is a joined-up approach to the problem, including the  development of sustainable renewable-energy sources that will have a positive  impact on economic, social and environmental factors. Energy companies also  have a responsibility to keep their prices as low as possible. Unregulated fuel  suppliers must engage with customers who are in financial difficulty, rather  than disconnecting supplies when people cannot keep up with rising prices.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">My colleague Martina Anderson was recently in Venezuela, and  the Government there are willing to offer oil in return for expertise in areas  such as agriculture and town planning.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Anderson</strong>:  The Member mentioned the staggering 28% price increase by Phoenix Gas, which is  a disgrace. Oil prices are at an all-time high and are continuing to soar,  which means that the situation for most families is becoming increasingly  bleak. It is against that backdrop that Save the Children has called for the  introduction of seasonal heating grants of &pound;100 per child. The Housing  Executive has also launched an investigation into the impact of rising fuel  costs on child poverty. Does the Member agree that when the results of that  investigation are published, and we have been told that they will contain  proposals to tackle the problem, the appropriate Ministers should deal with the  situation? The issue of rising fuel costs should unite all Members, because it  is a disgrace that families who live in a so-called twenty-first century  western democracy cannot afford to keep their children warm.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As has been stated, we have no power over the fuel  companies and we are operating within a limited budget that will never be  sufficient to provide a decent standard of living for all our people.  Therefore, we must think outside the box. Does the Member agree that a focus is  required on renewables and sustainable-energy sources as a long-term solution?  I agree with the Member and call on the Executive to enter into a trade  agreement with Venezuela.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As the Member mentioned, I was recently in Venezuela, where the Government have a proven  track record of providing low-cost oil to areas of social disadvantage in the US and  elsewhere in the world. I met senior members of the Venezuelan Government and  oil company officials and have no doubt that they are keen to explore the  possibilities of entering into an arrangement with the Executive. Go raibh  maith agat.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  The Member&rsquo;s time is up. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">5.30 pm</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms J McCann</strong>:  Mortgage lenders, too, have a responsibility. Homes are being repossessed, so  the lenders have a responsibility to give time and latitude to people who  cannot keep up with mortgage repayments and enable them to keep a roof over  their heads.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Poverty can create other problems. Children living in homes  that have no heating, or less food on the table, find it more difficult to  concentrate on education. Their health and well-being is also at stake. The  recent investment conference has been roundly welcomed, and it is hoped that  opportunities will be generated for all &mdash; in particular the more disadvantaged  in society.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The review of the sustainable energy market has made a  number of recommendations. Those recommendations, coupled with Departments  working together on the serious issues of fuel and other forms of poverty, and  working towards targets to deal with climate change, will be a first step  towards creating a sustainable-energy sector that will benefit the environment  and tackle the social and economic problems faced by families because of fuel  poverty.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I urge Members to support the motion and the amendment. Go  raibh maith agat.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  I support the broad thrust of the motion. There is a growing awareness of the  effects of global warming, and the rising cost of fossil fuels means that  urgent action is required to diversify energy supplies and to look towards  renewables in particular to meet some of our energy needs and to help reduce  carbon emissions.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is also clear that we must do what we can to improve conditions  for those on low incomes and those burdened by ever-escalating energy costs. I  welcome the review of sustainable energy that has been carried out, and I  broadly welcome its recommendations.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We should not, however, adopt an isolationist approach on  this issue; the consequences of global warming and rising fuel costs are too  great. The matter must be examined on an all-island basis, and that is why the  SDLP has tabled the amendment, which refers to an all-island approach. The  concept of the single electricity market is now a reality. It is central to the  development of the energy sector for the future. We must invest in and plan for  our energy needs, including renewable energy, on an all-island basis.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a tremendous capacity for the development of wind  resources. This island has the second-best wind resource in Europe,  and it has the potential to produce much more of its energy from renewable  sources. Tidal energy and biomass have much potential that can be harnessed to  deliver sustainable, renewable energy. It is imperative that both Governments  work together to develop and harness the full potential of renewables by  addressing the restrictions that are currently in place.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Recently, I tabled a question to the Minister of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment &mdash; and I note the apology that the Minister has  sent &mdash; about the develop&shy;ment of renewables. It was disappointing to read in  the Minister&rsquo;s response that there are currently no plans to adopt a single  approach to encouraging renewables development across the island. Much can and  should be done to facilitate the producers of renewable energy in trading  across the border &mdash; whether that is Northern producers trading into the South,  or Southern producers trading in surpluses to the North.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The all-island grid study is the first comprehensive  assessment of the capacity of the power system and transmission network on the island of Ireland to absorb large amounts of  energy produced from renewables. The study examines the costs and benefits  associated with sourcing increased electricity from renewable energy.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The creation of an accessible and viable all-Ireland market  for electricity that is produced from renewables &mdash; which could be sourced on  either side of the border &mdash; could pave the way for the two Governments not only  to achieve their targets for sustainable energy and carbon reduction, but to  exceed them.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There is no doubt that climate change is one of this  century&rsquo;s most serious long-term threats. The evidence suggests that increasing  concentrations of greenhouse gases are a major contributor to climate change,  which will have serious and wide-reaching effects on people, land and wildlife,  including marine wildlife. The recent Stern Review Report on the Economics of  Climate Change highlighted some of the threats and the need for action to  address the problems. We may already be too late to reverse some of the  consequences of climate change, but, if we do not act urgently, the cost will  be even greater.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Earlier in the year, the National Trust warned us that the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway is threatened by rising sea levels and  coastal erosion. Indeed, that is not the only coastal area in Northern Ireland  that is under threat. It is clear that we must take urgent action.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion also mentions rising fuel costs. Creating a  diverse energy supply is important, given current energy costs. It now costs  over &pound;280 &mdash; which is almost &pound;300 &mdash; for a minimum fill of oil for a household.  Last month, Phoenix Natural Gas advised of its planned price increases of  around 30%. Furthermore, electricity prices are set to rise later in the  summer, with the possibility of further increases throughout the year.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is no surprise, therefore, that the number of households  that are considered to be living in fuel poverty has remained static. If there  were no intervention programmes, that figure would be much higher. The growing  energy bills, together with other demands on household budgets, will have a  devastating impact on low-income households.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As we know, Minister Foster has responsibility for planning.  She has made herself available for the debate, and she will probably be  interested in my comments on planning. An urgent overhaul of the planning  system is needed if we are to increase the amount of energy that is sourced  from renewables. I take the point that the Department has already put in train  a review of the planning process. Planning applications for wind farms and  turbines are stuck in the planning system, some for as long as two years,  others for even longer.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In response to a recent question, I was informed that the  Planning Service had still not made a decision on more than 18 applications  that were first lodged over 24 months ago. Another 16 applications have been  waiting for more than a year. The outworkings of that are that companies that  invest many millions of pounds in renewable energy may get fed up and look for  other suitable locations for their wind-farm developments. There is no doubt  that, in many other countries, those planning applications are processed in a  much shorter time frame. We need look no further than across the border, where  it takes around three months to process such an application.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">If we are serious about developing sustainable energy  sources and about meeting the climate-change targets, our planning system must  be more responsible and must be capable of meeting the needs of the renewables  sector in a more timely fashion.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  I support the motion and the amendment. Only last October, in this Chamber, we  discussed sustainable energy development and the need for bigger steps to bring  the Province into line with the rest of the UK and western Europe.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Aa&rsquo; hae spauk o&rsquo; hoo in Strenferd we wur testing oot a tied  turbine an this hiss&rsquo; bin pit in an we wull sinn&rsquo; ken hoo guid it is. It is  cleer that we hae tae tak steps tae reduce oor kerbin futprint in Norlin  Airlan. Tha duti lies in tha hauns o&rsquo; tha drive an poower providers an em pleased  that DETI wull be puttin oan pressur tae tha poower kumpanies throo tha  renewable obligation tae bring aboot 12% lectricity by 2012.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I mentioned in that debate the testing of a tide turbine on  Strangford Lough. That has been installed, and we will soon see how successful  it is. We must take steps to reduce our carbon footprint in Northern Ireland.  Responsibility for that also rests with the energy providers, and I am pleased  that DETI will be pressing the energy companies, through the renewables obligation,  to source 12% of electricity through a renewable source by 2012.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I congratulate the Minister for Social Development,  although she is not present, whose Department has installed solar panels in  Housing Executive homes when the heating systems have been changed. As a result,  during warm weather there is no need for electricity to heat water, and the  saving for the household, as well as to the environment, is considerable.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am no Einstein &mdash; no scientist, in fact &mdash; and some of the  mumbo jumbo that we hear on this subject is hard to follow. However, all of us  can understand the basic principle, which is that reduced CO2 emissions mean  more help for the environment. Furthermore, I know that less energy use means  more savings for my pocket. That simple theory has not been expounded upon  enough for the ordinary man and woman: in saving the environment and playing  their part in the reduction of emissions, they can offset the difficulty in  making ends meet that increases in gas and energy prices have caused.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In my constituency office, we switched our supplier to  Airtricity, a company that sources power from renewables. That resulted in  significant savings, which can be replicated in other offices and in homes.  There should be a concerted advertising campaign to make people aware of the  basic facts, and of the organisations that offer help and advice to make homes  more economical and more environmentally friendly. One of those is the Energy  Saving Trust, which assesses how a home loses money and needlessly damages the  environment.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">For those with internet access, it is easy to discover that  it is possible to save &pound;9 per year per light bulb by using an energy-saving  bulb that will last up to 12 times longer than a regular one. There are,  therefore, savings all round. Similarly, it can be learned that up to  two-thirds of heat can be lost through walls and lofts, and how cavity-wall  insulation can substantially reduce such loss. In addition, a boiler is  responsible for 60% of household carbon emissions, and a switch to an  energy-saving boiler will save up to &pound;200 a year in energy costs.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, for those who are hit hardest by fuel poverty &mdash;  those on housing estates, and the elderly &mdash; turning down a thermostat by 1&ordm;C  will save about &pound;50 a year and reduce CO2 output. Those who most need that  information are not getting it, and it must be made available to help people to  save money and to eradicate fuel poverty, which is the aim of the Assembly.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">DARD has said that it aims to &ldquo;educate&rdquo; 1,000 rural homes  by 2009. That objective must be extended to include the entire Province by all  Departments to ensure that people understand what can be achieved by changing  the small things &mdash; and small changes lead to big savings. People must also be  made aware that there is a grant scheme to help with the cost of such changes. Departments  must work together in a concerted effort to educate the people of the Province  who, by doing their bit for the environment, will make life easier for  themselves.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Through the efforts of teachers, children now follow their  parents, switching off lights and filling kettles with only as much water as is  needed, because they have a genuine desire to save polar bears. That, however,  is not enough. Families across the Province should be made aware of the dual  benefits of helping the environment and saving money. That, as much as  anything, will put Northern Ireland  on an even keel with the rest of the United Kingdom and might even push  us further up the energy-saving scale. People want to do their bit, and when  they learn that that will save them money, they will be even more eager to  relieve the strain on mounting fuel bills.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I support the motion and the amendment, and urge  Departments to co-operate fully to ensure that we keep our beautiful country  healthy for future generations to enjoy. For so many years, we have taken it  for granted.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">5.45 pm</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>: I  thank the Members who secured this important debate. Climate change is possibly  the greatest medium to long-term threat to security. Equally, fuel poverty is  one of the most immediate and pressing issues facing thousands of people in Northern Ireland  every day. This winter, if fuel prices continue to increase, countless more  people will be driven into fuel poverty. The two issues must be considered  together, as they are interlinked. The long-term reduction in fuel poverty and  the amelioration of climate change lie in the growth of sustainable energy  sources in Northern Ireland, Europe and, indeed, throughout the world.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister has had the opportunity to set courageous and  innovative targets and to embrace inventive ideas. Society at large supports  renewable energy and environmental issues. The Minister is in charge of a  matter that should not fall prey to some of the unique politicking that exists  in this place. It is for that reason that many people are disappointed that  more has not been done. The target of having 12% of electricity generated from  renewable resources by 2012 is welcome, even if it does not go beyond the direct  rule targets in DETI&rsquo;s strategic energy framework and in the Northern Ireland  sustainable development strategy. However, that target is not very ambitious. Scotland has a target to produce 40% of its  electricity from renewable resources by 2020, and that is matched by Germany and bettered by Sweden. Indeed,  the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment admitted that:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;We must be more ambitious in setting future renewable  energy targets.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The publication of the review of the sustainable  energy market, and this debate, provide a unique opportunity for the Minister  to reaffirm his commitment, to outline the targets that he hopes to achieve  above and beyond the targets in the Programme for Government, and to detail how  he intends to achieve them.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Energy suppliers are crucial to Northern Ireland&rsquo;s social and  economic development. Northern    Ireland is in a unique position, as its  natural resources could help it to develop into a renewable energy leader in  the European market. The grid study published in January 2008 showed that it is  feasible to harness up to 42% of power from renewable energy and that wind is  the cheapest and most readily available resource. Although there are some local  issues with wind generation, we should do more to tap into that economic,  environmental and social opportunity.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the steps that have been taken to introduce a  single energy market with the Republic   of Ireland. There have  also been some innovative individual projects in Northern Ireland, yet there is  still a lack of integrated, sustainable strategies in DETI and in the Executive  at large to ensure the increase that is needed.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Fuel poverty is a serious and increasing problem that  affects the most vulnerable in our society. The cost of fossil fuels is higher  than ever, and the situation seems to be worsening. Pensioners and low-income  families will face serious health problems this winter if the situation does  not improve. The Minister for Social Development and the interdepartmental  group on fuel poverty have done excellent work on grants and energy efficiency measures.  In the short term, that is the only way forward, but more needs to be done.  However, it is of paramount importance that the long-term energy security of,  and competition in, our energy market is increased. Only that will ensure that fuel  poverty is reduced in the long term, and Northern Ireland has the  opportunity to do that while increasing our green economy.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We are in danger of not maximising our potential to develop  a green economy. The Prime Minister estimated that the overall added value of  the low-carbon energy sector could be &pound;3 trillion annually worldwide by 2050,  and it could employ 25 million people. We must ensure that we gain the greatest  possible chunk of the market. That will have positive environmental and  socio-economic consequences for everyone in our society, especially for those  who suffer from fuel poverty. However, we need innovative thinking and  ambitious targets. I urge the Minister to start taking the necessary steps to  grasp the opportunity that the grid study has given us. I support the motion.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: At  the end of a day such as this, it is a pleasure to achieve unanimity in the  Chamber. I am sure that the Minister of the Environment&rsquo;s contribution will not  disturb that unanimity.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion mentions the environmental benefits of  sustainable energy and the serious socio-economic problem of fuel poverty.  Given the constituency that she represents, it is appropriate that Jennifer  McCann concentrated on the latter. In the face of the current fuel poverty  problem, and, as Leslie Cree said, the inevitability of continued increases in  the price of fossil fuels, we must ensure that we do all that we can to tackle  that problem. The Minister for Social Development recently outlined her role in  tackling that problem to the House.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The problem will continue and it cannot be solved by the  relatively modest measures that were funded under direct rule. The Assembly  must make serious changes to deal with the problem of fuel poverty to satisfy  the needs of our society. The Minister of the Environment&rsquo;s response is  interesting, although she is only one of several Ministers who might have been  involved in the debate.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">During recent media interviews, Lord Stern made it clear  that if he were to rewrite the Stern Review today &mdash; only two years on &mdash; he  would consider the problem to be more severe than he anticipated in 2006. If  the Assembly does not tackle those major environmental issues, people who  experience the greatest levels of poverty &mdash; whether in our own society or other  parts of the world that are more affected by climate change &mdash; will suffer.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is incumbent on us, as representatives of people who  sometimes forget that they live in the European Union &mdash; the richest trading  bloc in the world &mdash; to address the needs of our fellow citizens who experience  the direst poverty. That fact is often forgotten during discussions about our  requests to the Treasury for more funding. Moreover, we currently receive  additional funding from Dublin  for some of our infrastructure in the west. In reality, despite how we perceive  our position in these islands, we are among the richest countries worldwide,  and we contribute to the climate-change problems experienced by people  elsewhere.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The key point of the motion is the need for co-ordination  among Departments. It is a matter of serious concern that the extent of  joined-up government has not reached the expected level. Each Department has a  specific area of responsibility, and it is difficult to identify levels of  co-ordination. The fact &mdash; dare I say it &mdash; that the second-largest party in the  Executive wants an increase in joined-up government demonstrates that I am not  making a cheap point on behalf of the opposition. How institutions are  constructed and their level of co-ordination causes serious concern.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">DETI has general responsibility for energy and, therefore,  plays the leading role. I mentioned DSD&rsquo;s specific responsibilities for fuel  poverty. DOE has a wider environmental responsibility, and DARD is responsible  for the co-ordination of areas of greatest potential for sustainable energy.  DFP has input on matters such as building regulations. Of those five  Departments, DFP is, perhaps, the one that has done the least to recognise  those points.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The reality is that this island is surrounded by some of  the best tides and waves in the world for generating energy, with virtually the  best wind-power possibilities in Europe &mdash; with the possible exception of Scotland. Our  climate is ideal for growing biomass, whether willow or miscanthus. We need to  maximise those opportunities to benefit our people and the wider world. The  motion and the amendment highlight serious intent about how society should  progress.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I received correspondence today from Ministers on some of  the potential issues in respect of job creation. I discovered that the World  Wildlife Fund in Scotland commissioned a report five years ago, which  highlighted serious potential for job creation and scope for tackling poverty  and environmental concerns.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is regrettable that nothing similar has yet been published  for Northern Ireland.  However, the motion sends out the message that we must do something, and unite  around it.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Robinson</strong>:  Sustainable energy is undoubtedly a growth area for the Northern Ireland  economy. The price of oil has escalated over the past few months, and gas and  electricity prices have also risen. It is inevitable that we should seek to  encourage the design, development, production and usage of sustainable-energy  technology.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Northern    Ireland has a well-educated and well-trained  workforce that wants to work and is willing to retrain in order to work. We  should capitalise on that greatest of all assets for any country in order to  attract firms that produce the latest technologies. Solar panels, wind turbines  and wave power will develop as our finite resources run out. Northern Ireland  is at the start of an economically prosperous future, and we should be  attracting new technologies that will develop and power our economic future. Of  course, I suggest East Londonderry as an  admirably suitable site for any manufacturers of such technologies.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister and the rest of the Executive have not  overlooked renewables in their future plans, with ventures such as the SeaGen  tidal project in Strangford Lough. Various wind farms have been established,  and more are at the planning stage. The dubious blessings of strong breezes and  powerful waves are sustainable sources that could produce some of the  electricity that we will need to power &mdash; literally &mdash; our economic growth. Our  atmospheric conditions may suit the production of renewable energies, and we also  have some of the highest levels of air quality in the United Kingdom.  The use of sustainable energy will ensure that pollution levels are kept low  and that the unique quality of Ulster  air is maintained.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Renewable energy has many environmental benefits for Northern Ireland.  We must ensure that we produce the technology that will maintain that position,  and, as a result, create benefits for the economy and our citizens. The  Minister of Enterprise,  Trade and Investment recently said:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Sustainable energy is a priority for government to  ensure Northern Ireland  has secure, reliable and competitive energy supplies for the future.&rdquo;</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The Moyle interconnector and the SEM are examples of  how those words are becoming a reality. I congratulate the Minister of  Enterprise, Trade and Investment for ensuring that that is the case, and I know  that he wants to keep sustainable energy high on the agenda.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The amount of energy produced by renewables is targeted to  be increased from 3&middot;8% in 2006-07 to 12% in 2012-13. That is an ambitious  start, and the Minister will strive to ensure that it is met. I know that his  Department stands ready to co-ordinate a concerted interdepartmental effort to  maximise the energy produced from renewables, and I support him fully in his  efforts. I support the motion and the amendment.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McKay</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I support the motion and the SDLP  amendment. The timing of the motion is apt, bearing in mind the soaring price  of oil. The public will expect the Assembly to show leadership on this issue,  because the availability of energy has a massive impact on our quality of life,  the economy, the environment and our mobility. We must work towards a situation  in which we are much less reliant on oil, and we must be much more conservative  in our use of energy in general.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We already lag behind other parts of Europe  when it comes to renewable energy, and there must be more investment in that  sector. Energy must be more affordable for all parts of society if we are to  combat growing problems such as fuel poverty. There must be more joined-up  working when it comes to encouraging the public to leave the car at home and  use public transport, especially in rural areas. Government must ensure that  using public transport is more attractive financially, and they must educate  the public in that regard.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As previously stated, electricity, coal, oil and gas prices  are all rising. Families are struggling because of price increases in food,  petrol and mortgage repayments, and they must make choices between having food  and having heat and light. The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment  must set out how he will support renewable-energy installers and develop what  will be a key market in reducing our reliance on finite fuels.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Climate-change targets must be met, and we can make a  significant contribution to that by increasing the amount of electricity that  is generated from local, renewable sources. A large percentage of energy use is  domestic, and that is where we must change our old habits by ensuring that  everyone can avail themselves of affordable renewable energy and reduce  domestic reliance on oil.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">6.00 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We have some of the best wind resources in Europe, and we must ensure that electricity-grid and  planning constraints are overcome. The Government in the South have set an  ambitious target of generating 33% of their energy from renewable sources by  2020. There is no reason why that target could not be met across the island.  Excellent R&amp;D is taking place in our colleges and universities, and we have  an opportunity to create sustainable jobs in the rural and farming communities  by incorporating a renewables market into rural diversification and the rural  economy.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Ireland  could, and should, be a leader in renewable energy. We should build on some of  the good work that has been done to date, such as the Renewable Energy   Installer Academy,  which has already received commendable reports. That project should be  protected and built upon to ensure that our renewable technology remains of the  highest standard.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Generating sustainable energy, reducing our reliance on  finite fuels and protecting the most vulnerable in society from fuel poverty  are not the responsibilities of any one Department. DETI, DSD, DRD and all the  other Departments must show joined-up planning and leadership to ensure that  the forthcoming energy dilemmas do not detrimentally affect the economy, the  environment or the well-being of the public. I support the motion and the  amendment.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I support the motion and the SDLP&rsquo;s amendment. At this late hour, and after so  much has been said already, the respectable turnout for this debate is  testimony to the sustainable energy of the Members who have stayed.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As has been said, this is a topical debate, given the recent  28% rise in the price of gas. As so much of our electricity is generated in  gas-fired power stations, we anticipate that that price rise will have an  impact on NIE&rsquo;s prices. Concern has been expressed in the motion, and around  the House, about the anticipated knock-on effect of such price rises on people  living in fuel poverty. We already anticipate that about 150,000 people will be  living in fuel poverty, and that is a grave concern, given the rising cost of  fossil fuels.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">All Members have acknowledged today that wider issues are  at stake in the discussion on energy, not least climate change, which has been  talked about at length. There are other issues, such as the ongoing need to  secure our energy supply, how long fossil fuels will last, and how dependent we  can be on unstable regimes in the Middle East  or Russian oligarchs for oil and gas supplies.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We must also face looming issues, such as the proposed EU  renewable energy directive, and its target of 15% renewable-energy consumption.  Opting in to that, or being forced to meet such targets by the UK Government,  will put a massive burden and strain on Northern Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Although we all agree that concerted action on the issue is  required, experience shows that it is not a simple matter of saying that something  must be done, and it will be done. We cannot simply click our fingers and find  that the matter has been sorted out overnight. Many major challenges and hard  choices characterise every aspect of the energy issue. It is apt that the  Minister of the Environment will be responding to the motion in place of the  Minister of Enterprise,  Trade and Investment, because many of the issues that are constantly raised  affect her when she is wearing her hat as planning Minister.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There has been much talk today about how wealthy this  country is in natural resources, and how those might be harnessed. However, if  we examine those options, such as wind energy, it is not a simple matter, as Mr  Gallagher said, of proposals being stuck in the planning system for an eternity.  Some proposals remain stuck in the planning system for what seems like an  eternity due to local objections.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The SeaGen prototype wave-energy project is in my  constituency of Strangford, although Jim Wells argues that, because it is in  Strangford Lough, it is closer to South Down. He is not here to defend his  position, and I will not do so for him. However, even that very good project  has met resistance and criticism about the way in which it might affect marine  mammals. Indeed, there might even be somebody who is on constant seal watch at  that facility.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Moving on to biofuels, which have been mentioned; one  argument states that it is good for farmers to diversify into biofuels, while  another states that they raise food prices and cause food shortages.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Energy from waste is another example of a proposal for a  solution to the energy problem that is already on the table. That proposal,  which employs chicken waste material, is meeting local opposition. Indeed, any  energy-from-waste plant that comes through the public-sector route is likely to  meet some resistance at ground level.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Even if we could harness all our obvious renewable energy  opportunities, there are issues relating to the grid, which is where the  all-island grid study comes in. First, a major investment would be required to  increase the level of penetration of renewable energy to 42%. Secondly, there  are infrastructure issues, as we have seen with respect to the interconnector &mdash;  where there have been objections to something that would be useful to have. Given  that my time is running out, I will leave nuclear power for another day.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In the case of virtually each and every renewable or  sustainable energy scheme, one could argue that there is a need for it, and  that we will need to consider some or all of the options at some stage; but the  issue is not that simple. We must proceed realistically and at the right pace  as the technology grows. It is not simply a matter of clicking our fingers and  it will be done; people will object in one way or another to various schemes of  this kind. However, those objections, and even issues such as fuel poverty,  will pale in comparison to the alternative.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McFarland</strong>:  Sustainable energy is a complex issue, as we have heard so far, and I hope to  provide some clarification now. We are interested in sustainable energy because  we have all been persuaded that if we do not change our ways, the world will  come to an end &mdash; it is heating up due to global warming; our children will all  end up frying if we do not do something about it now; and fossil fuels, we have  been told, are running out.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Although we are panicking, the Americans do not seem to be  troubled about the issue and they are refusing to sign up to the Kyoto protocol. China is  building an extra coal-fired power station every day, and the Indian economy is  expanding. Those countries should not be criticised for trying to make life  better for their people, but while we are panicking about whether we need to  downsize our cars, they are chucking all sorts of stuff into the atmosphere and  making the problem worse.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There are two parallel ways to deal with this matter. On an  individual level, we could, for example, insulate our houses better &mdash; and it is  slightly weird that Reconnect, which was allowing people to do just that, has  been pulled by the Executive. We could also fix solar panels to our roofs, but  they are of limited value. We could downsize our cars and have the odd windmill  outside our houses. Indeed, some Members may have seen the windmill that was on  top of the hill close to here. It lasted for a while, but the owner has taken  it down as it clearly was not profitable for him to have it working.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">On a wider scale, we could have wind farms; we already have  them on the Antrim Hills and in Tyrone. We could have tidal and wave power &mdash;  and we have heard about SeaGen, which is probably the best option in the future  for saving the planet. We could have hydro power &mdash; and Scotland has  spent a lot of time flooding its highland valleys to provide hydro-electricity.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We could have biomass, where a lot of willow is grown and  which may provide an opportunity for farmers who are worried about  diversification. We could have biofuels &mdash; and there is a current craze for maize,  which, sadly, is causing chaos in America because farmers there have started  growing it for fuel rather than food, and they cannot now get maize to feed  their cattle. Their production system is going bananas.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We could have that other word, which is not mentioned in  the Committee for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment &mdash; nuclear. It is odd that France  and England have decided to  increase their nuclear capability, with France building five extra nuclear  power stations. It must be a case of saying that because the interconnector is  coming to us, North and South, we will be alright. The island of Ireland  will not have to worry because we can get nuclear-generated electricity while  pretending that we have nothing to do with nuclear power.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, there are knock-on effects from each of those  things. To meet the targets and the recommendations for wind power, we would  probably have to cover great swathes of the country with windmills. One can  imagine people flying in from America  to see the beautiful Northern Ireland  landscape &mdash; the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway, and so on &mdash;  and being greeted by wall-to-wall windmills. Is it proposed that the glens of  Antrim should be flooded to produce hydropower?</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I understand that a report from the Royal Society for the  Protection of Birds has found that biofuels are just as bad for the climate as  fossil fuels. That is reminiscent of the margarine-or-butter debate &mdash; we  stopped using one and started to use the other until another report stated that  both were as bad as each other. If the nuclear option is adopted, live material  is buried for millennia in Welsh caves, and so on. There is much confusion and  many problems in respect of this matter.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As Simon Hamilton said, even if we could generate the extra  electricity, there would be mega drama because the grid could not cope with it.  Furthermore, such a scheme would require a major amount of money, and the  Minister would require lots of planning permission. One only has to note the  drama in Armagh, where attempts were made to  put a few kilometres of wire in and the entire world was up in arms. It is fine  to have targets, but mega problems arise in making those a reality.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Oil prices have gone up &mdash; I recently paid &pound;500 for 900  litres of fuel oil. That affects people on the ground. Therefore, there is  social aspect to this issue. Why have oil prices gone up? Is it because of  OPEC, is there a refining problem, or have the price increases been socially  engineered to force us to deal with climate change?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B Wilson</strong>:  I disagree with most of the views expressed by the Member who has just spoken.  However, I welcome this debate and the opportunity to highlight the potential  benefits that renewable energy can bring to Northern Ireland, including  protection of our environment, job creation, and helping us to meet the target  of eliminating fuel poverty by 2016.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As Mr Ford pointed out, Northern Ireland has a vast  potential for producing electricity from renewable sources, particularly wind,  tides and biomass. Despite that, Northern Ireland is bottom of the  relevant European league table, with a mere 1&middot;2% of our electricity being  produced from renewable sources. Figures from the UK Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory  Reform show that the average wind farm can produce electricity at a cost of 3p  to 6p per unit. Why, then, should householders here pay an NIE tariff of 11p  per unit for electricity? That must change.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Oil and gas prices are rising rapidly so we must start to  invest in alternatives. Otherwise, fuel poverty will increase, rather than be  eradicated. Last September, the price of oil was 35p a litre; it is now 55p a  litre &mdash; a rise of over 50% in under a year. That rise is set to continue  because peak oil production has passed and the worldwide demand for oil is  increasing rapidly.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Wood-pellet boilers can provide home heating at half the  cost of oil or gas. For example, wood-pellet boilers installed by the Housing  Executive in Clough heat a three-bedroom house at an average cost of &pound;9 a week.  That is compared with neighbours in that area who pay &pound;25 a week for oil. I am  pleased that the Housing Executive has proposed to introduce schemes that will  fit wood-pellet boilers in 30 more houses. I urge the Minister for Social  Development to stop installing oil and gas boilers in social housing under the  warm homes scheme and the Housing Executive&rsquo;s heating replacement scheme.  Wood-pellet boilers should be installed instead; there is not much difference  in the respective costs of installation.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I congratulate the Executive on the installation of more  than 2,000 solar panels since August 2006. That project cost &pound;5&middot;2 million and  was funded through the environment and renewable energy fund. Unfortunately,  that funding ended in March, and, therefore, the installation of solar panels  in social housing also ended. However, &pound;17 million from the environment and  renewable energy fund&rsquo;s energy from waste scheme remains unspent. That is not  even a form of renewable energy, because it encourages the production of waste.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">That money would be better spent installing solar panels on  Housing Executive properties to reduce fuel poverty. The ending of the environment  and renewable energy fund and the decision of the Minister of Finance to end  the Reconnect grants and to remove the renewables obligation from the building  regulations threaten to kill Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s renewable-energy industry, which  employs 1,400 people and which could create up to 5,500 new jobs.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There is not the political will in the Executive to match Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  great potential for the expansion of renewable energy, nor is there sufficient co-operation  between Departments to make the necessary changes. The Environment Minister  announces that we must reduce CO2 emissions by 50% by 2050, while the Minister  with responsibility for energy abolishes the Reconnect grants and the renewable  energy fund. The Minister for Social Development adopts the code for  sustainable homes at level 3, with a commitment to zero-carbon homes by 2016,  while the Minister of Finance removes the renewables obligation from the  building regulations. The Programme for Government states the intention to  promote local entrepreneurship and to create sustainable jobs, while,  collectively, the Executive threaten to strangle at birth the indigenous  renewable-energy industry.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Northern Ireland  could lead the rest of the UK  and Ireland  in renewable-energy production and help to reduce fuel poverty. We have the  abilities and the knowledge to be a green light to others. I urge the House to  support the motion and the amendment.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment (Mrs Foster)</strong>: It is fortuitous that I respond to the  motion, as many of the issues raised apply to my Department as much as to the  Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We have heard how the Department of Enterprise, Trade and  Investment completed, in December 2007, a review of the sustainable-energy  market in Northern Ireland  in order to inform policy development on the issue. That review examined the  market position and, among other things, assessed the options available to meet  DETI&rsquo;s 1% energy-efficiency target, the renewable-energy-consumption target of  12% by 2012 and other challenging targets arising from the implementation of  the energy end-use efficiency and energy services directive. The review  examined all sectors of the sustainable-energy market: domestic, industrial,  commercial, the voluntary/community sector and public sectors. It looked at  large- and small-scale renewables and energy efficiency.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In several areas, the review identified new options for  consideration in the light of increased public engagement in climate-change issues:  the strength of arguments presented in analyses such the Stern Review, to which  Mr Ford referred; the emergence of corporate response to climate change; and  UK-wide commitments to renewable energy and greenhouse-gas emissions. A key  element in the review was the identification of gaps and barriers to the  sustainable-energy marketplace and to identify actions to address those gaps  and barriers in future.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">To that end, the review generated recommendations that cut  across the responsibilities of several Departments, as well as measures that  DETI can implement immed&shy;iately. Mr Ford spoke about joined-up Government: just  because some of us are in Government does not mean that we do not recognise the  need for work to be done in such areas. He probably knows that I wrote to the  Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister, suggesting that it  needed to form a subcommittee on sustainable development. That is important if  we are to progress on the issues that he identified. He also &mdash;</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: I  appreciate the Minister&rsquo;s reference to my comment. What is the position with  regard to the subcommittee on sustainable development?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I have yet to receive a response from the junior  Ministers, but I will let the Member know when it arrives.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Ford also referred to jobs. He is aware that quite a few  jobs were created by the SeaGen marine current turbine, and he knows that  Invest NI is working to provide more jobs in the energy sector.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Cree spoke of the need to raise the target from 12%. He  knows that, under the European directive, there is a need to move to 15%,  which, I am sure, he will welcome.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Jim Shannon welcomed the work of bodies such as the Energy  Savings Trust and offered his support for a coherent joined-up message. That was  very much a theme of the debate.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">On the behalf of the DETI Minister, I acknowledge the work  of sustainable-energy bodies such as the Energy Savings Trust, Action  Renewables, the Carbon Trust and the Northern Ireland Energy Agency. I agree  that a joined-up approach is essential, and I know that DETI is leading  cross-departmental work on that issue. That Department has been speaking to my  officials about many of those matters.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It should be stressed that the recommendations of the  review represent only the first step. Minister Dodds has reviewed the  recommendations and was pleased to note that the review recognised the  dedication and expertise of all the organisations involved in the Northern Ireland  sustainable-energy market. He was also pleased to see that Northern Ireland, on the whole, benchmarks well  against not only other UK  regions, but the regions of Europe that were  used as comparators for the purpose of the review.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, it is important to note that opportunities exist  to learn from some of the activities undertaken by some of the comparator  regions. DETI officials are evaluating the review&rsquo;s recommendations, many of  which require more detailed work &mdash; on issues such as cost and economic  viability &mdash; before any decisions are made on which of the recommendations will  be implemented. Many of the recommendations are cross-cutting, and relevant  work is ongoing among officials from various Departments.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We are all aware &mdash; perhaps with the exception of Mr  McFarland &mdash; of the need to act now to minimise of the amount of energy that is  used in Northern Ireland  and to minimise harmful emissions to help to protect the environment. No one  can deny that our climate is changing, both globally and on a local scale.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I recognise the comments that were made by Mr McFarland  about other countries. However, that does not mean that we do not need to do  something about our climate-change commitments in this country. We need to get  on with the game.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Mindful of that, DETI and the Department of Communications,  Energy and Natural Resources in the Republic   of Ireland have carried  out a study, which is referred to in the SDLP amendment. That study addresses  how additional generation from renewable sources could be accommodated within  the electricity grid. Results show that, although that is technically feasible,  to accommodate a significant increase in renewable-energy generation, a  significant investment in the electrical grid infrastructure would be required.  Mr Hamilton mentioned the ability of the Northern Ireland electrical grid to  transmit up to 42% renewable energy. A balance must be struck between improving  the sustainability and security of our energy supply and &mdash; I can say this with  my environment hat on &mdash; the protection of the environment.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Members will know that consultation on draft PPS 18 has  just closed. That document deals with the criteria for renewable energy, and it  has been welcomed by the wind-energy industry. It may be serendipity, but I  held a meeting today with wind-energy industry representatives, and we had a  good discussion about what action is needed to meet the targets on renewable  energy.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Securing our future energy supply is high on the  Government&rsquo;s agenda as we seek to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels. It is  vital that we deliver a more cohesive and joined-up solution. To that end,  discussions have taken place between DETI and DOE officials, but I recognise  that there is still much to do.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Work has been carried out to promote wind energy &mdash; which is  probably the most commercial and viable renewable technology that is available.  However, there are other sources of energy such as marine-current turbines and  &mdash; as the proposer of the motion mentioned &mdash; biofuels. I was going to be a  little mischievous and commit the DETI Minister to nuclear energy. However, I think  that that would be a bit much, standing in his place.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Wind is the most naturally available source of renewable  energy in Northern Ireland,  but it is also important to encourage the growth of non-wind renewables. The co-ordinated  approach that is available should be grasped, and that will enable Northern Ireland  to optimise the potential benefits across the energy, agriculture, enterprise,  transport and environmental sectors, while contributing to renewable-energy  targets and the reduction of greenhouse-gas emissions.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The proposer of the motion, and Martina Anderson a Member  for Foyle &mdash; during a lengthy intervention &mdash; mentioned fuel poverty.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">They will both know that DETI has no role in determining  energy prices, but it strives at all times to create market conditions that,  over the long term, will drive prices down. DETI is only too aware of the  recent increases in world energy costs &mdash; global gas prices this summer are  expected to be 100% higher than in the same period last year. Minister Dodds  and his officials are conscious of the impact that increases have on the  business community and on those who were mentioned by Jennifer McCann and the  Member for Foyle Ms Anderson &mdash; the fuel poor.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">With that in mind, DETI has sought over recent years to  reduce the burden of energy costs on low-income families through the  introduction of a new single wholesale electricity market; the mutualisation of  energy assets, such as the Moyle electricity interconnector; the Scotland to  Northern Ireland gas pipeline; the Phoenix Natural Gas transmission business;  and the use of a &pound;5&middot;6 million grant to defray the 2007-08 energy efficiency  level, which reduced the electricity tariffs to 1% below what they otherwise  would have been.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">DETI officials have also been involved in the  interdepartmental group on fuel poverty, which is chaired by Minister Ritchie.  I understand that she will announce her plans on fuel poverty very soon.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Ministers are keen to identify the best energy solutions  for Northern Ireland  in relation to sustainable energy, and to encourage us to become an exemplar  for sustainable energy. It is important that all our future activities address  gaps and barriers, as highlighted in the review. I hope that I have addressed  some of the comments that were made in the debate, and I will inform Minister  Dodds of any concerns that I have been unable to address.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I think that peace has broken out in the Assembly after the rougher debates  that took place earlier today.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>:  Will it be sustainable?</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  It will be sustained in the Assembly for at least another hour or two. I am  grateful to all parties for supporting the important amendment. As the Minister  said, the amendment draws attention to the study that seeks to achieve an  all-Ireland target of roughly 40% renewable energy in the production of  electricity. That is important.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister, succinctly, drew our attention to the fact  that we are rich in the natural resources &mdash; such as wind, biomass and tidal  power &mdash; that are required to generate renewable energy, and it is important to  emphasise that.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There was almost unanimity in the Chamber, apart from Mr  McFarland, who raised the N-word &mdash; the nuclear option. Perhaps his interest  comes from his military background; I am not sure. He also tried to incite  Daith&iacute; McKay by threatening to flood the glens. Nevertheless, most Members sang  from the same hymn sheet and are genuinely committed to the development of  renewable energy. It is imperative that we be so. We cannot sustain further  dramatic and drastic price rises, which overburden the most vulnerable in our  society and which will, ultimately, overburden the institutions. It is  essential that we invest wisely in renewable energy.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I have one note of caution on biofuels. Mr Simon Hamilton  referred to the problem with biofuels, and the World Bank stated recently that  biofuels have contributed substantially to an 80% price increase in food  throughout the world. That will have devastating consequences for tens of  millions of people who live in the developing world. In addition, the European  Environment Agency has called for the European Union to suspend its 10% target  for biofuel use until more comprehensive scientific work has been done to  assess their risks.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, problems with the use of biofuels arise not only  because they inflate the cost of food, but because more scientific knowledge  needs to be gathered and because of the impact that they have on the  environment. It is important that that is taken into consideration.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">6.30 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">It is also important that we express concerns about the  renewable transport fuel obligation, which demands that petrol retailers mix  2&middot;5% biofuel into the petrol that they sell to motorists. The obligation also  demands that that amount rise to 5&middot;75% by 2010. Such a policy simply encourages  the unrestrained use and production of biofuels, which could &mdash; although I am  not saying that it absolutely will &mdash; have a negative impact on our economy and  our environment. That is a word of warning.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">We are united in our efforts to get Departments to work  together, and the Minister emphasised that attempts are being made to do that.  Mr Ford also emphasised the importance of such work, as did Jennifer McCann. It  is important that the Government make a united effort to bring about a  revolution in the use of renewable energy in Northern Ireland.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Maskey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank all the Members who  participated in the debate. I hope that the motion and the amendment will put  the spotlight on sustainable energy and fuel poverty, which are important  matters. The motion calls for:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;closer co-operation between different departments to  ensure that sustainable energy, including renewable energy, is developed in  such a way that benefits the environment&rdquo;.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">At this stage in our history, we have the opportunity to  make a difference.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Assembly should show leadership in promoting  initiatives that will benefit the environment. For too long, there has been no  forward or joined-up thinking about sustainable energy. We must change that &mdash;  we need to get it right for the sake of our future and that of our children,  because they are the ones who will suffer.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Some organisations have done a great deal of good work on  energy issues, and they have raised the profile of the matter at many levels.  For example, the NI Energy Agency is a one-stop-shop-style organisation that is  charged with the implementation of policy in the areas of renewable energy,  energy efficiency and low-carbon transport advice. Those matters could and  should be explored in greater detail. Such a body could act as a conduit for  the many different Departments that are responsible for energy issues.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a great deal of confusion about the functions that  each Department carrys out on sustainable energy. We must change that situation  and implement proper policies to ensure that that confusion no longer exists.  Our party colleague Bairbre de Br&uacute;n has raised the issue of sustainable energy  in relation to the EU task force, and she also discussed it during her recent  visit to Washington.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Jennifer McCann opened the debate eloquently &mdash; Martina  Anderson tried to steal her thunder halfway through her speech, but Jennifer  managed to get it back, so I congratulate Jennifer for that. Tommy Gallagher  spoke on the amendment, and he made the point that investment must be made in  the single electricity market in order to benefit all our futures. He also  discussed planning issues for wind farms, and he mentioned how some planning  applications for wind farms can take up to two years or sometimes longer to be  processed. That is an important issue, and I am glad that the Minister of the  Environment is here to listen to those concerns, as I am sure that she shares  them.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Jim Shannon spoke about the Strangford turbine that has  been installed. There has been a great deal of publicity about that, and it was  important that it was raised. I hope that that scheme will prove to be a model  for good practice.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Jim also spoke about energy-saving light bulbs, which can  make a massive difference. It does not take much for us to get our heads round  that. Again, that is an issue of awareness.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Leslie Cree talked about the targets for sustainable energy  not being serious enough, and the need to be more adventurous. It was said that  the Minister of Enterprise,  Trade and Investment realises that, so, hopefully, the targets will be much  more challenging in the future.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">David Ford talked about the huge environmental issues that  have to be tackled, which is why the motion refers to closer co-operation  between different Departments. I hope that that closer co-operation will enable  the issues to be addressed at a higher level.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">George Robinson spoke about new technologies and how he  hoped that they could be developed in East Derry.  Some Members may argue for the development of such technologies in their own  constituencies, so we may not agree on that issue. Francie Brolly may have  something to say about that during the Adjournment debate.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Daith&iacute; McKay spoke about the need for the Executive to show  leadership, which is exactly what the public want. They want politicians to  show leadership and take responsibility for the issue. It is too important an  issue not to do so.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Simon Hamilton referred to Members having their own  sustainable energy. If someone were to bottle the hot air that is produced in  the Chamber, enough energy may be generated to power a small city. Perhaps we  should consider that.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Alan McFarland talked about the American Govern&shy;ment  refusing to sign up to some environmental treaties. That is nothing new; they  do their own thing without respecting the wishes of other people. That is an  issue that the American Government need to take on board. Alan went on to  mention, as did others, the nuclear option. I do not want a nuclear plant in  West Belfast, or, indeed, on the island   of Ireland. Perhaps Alan  wants one in his constituency of North Down. That is an issue that he can raise  another time.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Brian Wilson mentioned the worldwide demand for oil, which  is increasing. He urged the Minister for Social Development to promote the  installation of wood-pellet boilers instead of oil boilers in social housing.  In recent weeks, many members of the public have talked about the increases in  prices of fuel, which is related to the fuel-poverty issue. I hope that some of  the Departments will take Mr Wilson&rsquo;s comments on board.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Minister Foster, although responding in place of the  Minister of Enterprise,  Trade and Investment, said that many of the issues that were raised concerned  her Department. Therefore, it was good that she was present for the debate, and  she has assured the House that she will raise with the Minister of Enterprise,  Trade and Investment the issues that relate to his Department.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Alban Maginness, rightly, said that the amendment adds to  the motion and that it was important that all parties support the motion and  the amendment.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">In West Belfast and other  areas throughout the North, families face massive socio-economic problems in  which fuel poverty plays a part. Such problems have to be tackled. We recently  heard from the chief executive of the Authority for Energy Regulation, Iain  Osborne, about ever-increasing energy prices. People on low incomes have many  reasons to be concerned after the regulator published his most recent report.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Recently, many of my constituents have raised their  concerns about fuel poverty. More and more of them are falling into the bracket  that classes them as suffering because of fuel poverty. The Assembly must do  all that it can to reverse that trend. In this day and age, if one family  cannot afford to heat their home, that is one family too many.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Fuel poverty is an indictment on the society that we live  in today. It is also an indictment on the direct rule Ministers, who, for many  years, did not recognise the issue, and did absolutely nothing about it or  about sustainable energy.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that, with the motion and the amendment being passed  today, the Ministers take the issue on board and that we move into the future  in a more positive manner. Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText"><span class="B3BodyTextItalicChar"><span style="font-size:11.0pt; ">Question,</span></span> That the amendment be made, <span class="B3BodyTextItalicChar"><span style="font-size:11.0pt; ">put and agreed to.</span></span></p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Main Question, as amended, put and agreed to.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly notes the recommendations in the review of  the Sustainable Energy Market; further notes the findings of the All-Island  Grid Study in respect of investment and planning needed to allow the  electricity grid to transmit up to 42% renewable electricity; and calls on the  Executive to ensure that there is closer co-operation between different  departments to ensure that sustainable energy, including renewable energy, is  developed in such a way that benefits the environment, and tackles the  socio-economic problems that face families due to fuel poverty.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Motion made:</p>
		    <p class="Q3Motion">That the Assembly do now adjourn. &mdash;<span class="Italic"> [Mr Deputy  Speaker.]</span></p>
		    <p class="H3SectionHeading"><a name="7"></a>Adjournment</p>
		    <p class="H4StageHeading">Waste Management in East Derry/Londonderry</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The proposer of the topic for debate will have 15 minutes in which  to speak, and all other Members who wish to speak will have approximately eight  minutes.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brolly</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that  my speech will not last for 15 minutes.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">This debate concerns the small townland of Ringsend, near  Garvagh. For those who do not know the area, it is along the Coleraine to Limavady  road. It is a very pleasant, quiet, rural, forested area with a beautiful view  of Lough Foyle and the Donegal Hills as one travels towards Limavady along the Craigmore Road.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">That is a very picturesque and popular residential area,  and I wish to highlight the very real possibility of the proliferation of  landfill sites there. Proposed landfill sites are too close together &mdash; of the  four potential sites, the two that are the furthest apart have a distance  between them of just three and a half miles. Some of those sites clearly  contravene the proximity principle for waste management.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The largest proposed site is on the Cam Road. That is the site that is  preferred by the North West Region Waste Management Group, and it will serve  seven of the current council areas. Planning permission is very likely to be  granted for that site.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The second proposed site is on the Craigmore Road. That site was a former  landfill facility that was privately owned but was leased for use by Coleraine  Borough Council. That site has a bad history, because the original proprietor  got into trouble with the law in respect of how the site was run. The site has  now been properly refurbished, and it is due to open soon. It will be licensed  for certain types of waste and it will incorporate a recycling facility.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The third site is being applied for by a private developer.  It is on the Belraugh Road,  which is between the Ringsend Road  and the Dungiven Road.  The site will be used mainly for the dumping of building waste. That should not  give rise to the normal worries that are associated with landfill sites, where  all types of waste are present.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The fourth possible site is on the Letterloan Road. That is a more remote  possibility, but it is worth mentioning because of concerns about the  cumulative effect of four adjacent sites. The people of the area would like to forestall  those plans by being forewarned. The Letterloan    Road site has been mooted as a possible site for mechanical  biological treatment. That is a real possibility because the North West Region  Waste Management Group is actively considering the development of such a plant.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">If those sites were developed, they would be kept very  busy. They would serve a large area of the north-west. They are very close  together, and would be accessed via the small rural roads of the area. That  leads to consequent concerns about traffic volume, site control, smell and  leachates; not to mention the possible drop in the value of residences there,  and the devaluing of the area&rsquo;s residential popularity.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Although we accept that modern landfill sites are much  better constructed and much better controlled, the concern is that the cumulative  effect of even well-controlled sites will be excessive. The residents have good  reason to be concerned.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">A local residents&rsquo; committee is organising resistance to  that possibility. Nobody wants a landfill site, and the people of Ballerin  certainly do not want four of them.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">6.45 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The residents&rsquo; committee made a presentation to Coleraine  Borough Council. A Sinn F&eacute;in proposal to approach the environmental health  service and to write to the Minister was agreed by the council. Councillor  Billy Leonard, who made that proposal, also raised the issue with Bairbre de  Br&uacute;n, and that is being developed. A petition will be taken to Europe on the question of proliferation. It is hoped that  Bairbre de Br&uacute;n, a Member of the European Parliament, will meet the residents&rsquo;  committee.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am simply expressing the concerns of the people of  Ballerin. I hope that something can be done on their behalf to forestall the  landfill sites that would completely change the face of such a beautiful rural  area. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McQuillan</strong>:  I agree with much of what Mr Brolly said, but I do not recall Councillor  Leonard proposing anything at the council meeting; perhaps that slipped past  me. However, that is a story for another day.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I will refer to the same region that Mr Brolly mentioned &mdash;  the Ringsend/Ballerin area &mdash; and go into the background of some of the dumps in  that area. I hope that you will bear with me, Mr Deputy Speaker.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The waste management plan, which has been agreed by all  seven councils in the North West Region Waste Management Group, identified the  need for a regional landfill site to cater for the future needs of the area.  Only two of the councils &mdash; Coleraine and Magherafelt &mdash; have landfill sites  operating currently and the capacity in those sites is limited.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Through an EU procurement exercise, expressions of interest  in providing a landfill facility in the region were solicited. The results of  that exercise identified the site at the Cam  quarry as the preferred option, and that was agreed by each individual council  in the group. That is the only landfill possibility that the North West Region  Waste Management Group has an interest in pursuing, and the owners of the site  are preparing an application for planning.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The waste management plan identified the now closed landfill  site at Letterloan Road,  Macosquin, which was operated by Coleraine Borough Council, as one of a number  of:</p>
		    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Potential locations for the development of an MBT  study, under the ownership/control of Councils&rdquo;.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">To date, no action has been taken with regard to  those potential sites. Mechanical biological treatment is not a landfill  operation: waste is taken to an enclosed space and suitable materials are  separated for recycling. The remainder of the waste undergoes heat treatment to  produce pellets for possible use in commercial boilers.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">A site at Craigmore    Road, Garvagh, exists with planning permission for  landfill. Work is being carried out on the site to comply with the conditions  necessary for the Department of the Environment to grant a permit to allow the  facility to be used. The site has a long history of extremely poor operational  conditions under the former owner, who served a prison sentence for operating  the site illegally.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a substantial objection from local residents to  that site being allowed to operate, and they are calling to have all illegally  deposited waste removed. If that were agreed, it would go a long way to restore  some confidence in the system.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">An application for a site at Belraugh Road, Macosquin, to take inert  waste &mdash; clay, rubble and such like &mdash; has been lodged with the Planning Service  and as yet no determination has been made. If that site were to be granted  permission to go ahead, it would be a disgrace, as it is a lovely green valley.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The North West Region Waste Management Group has no  interest in either the site at Craigmore    Road or the site at Belraugh Road. The proposal for the Cam  quarry would reinstate an old quarry rather develop a greenfield site, as would happen for the  proposals at the Craigmore Road  and the Belraugh Road  sites. The Minister will recall that I accompanied the residents when they met  her. We had a forthright meeting at which the residents put their views to the  Minister, and at which she outlined her views. I look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s  response.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McClarty</strong>:  Before I begin, I apologise to the House and to the Minister for being unable  to remain for her response; I look forward to reading it tomorrow in Hansard.  Unfortunately, I have to be in another place 20 minutes ago.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I will not go over what was said about the Ringsend and  Ballerin area. There has been much debate in the Coleraine Borough Council  chamber, and much has been said tonight. It is an area of beauty, and many of its  residents have deep concerns about the use of the land, and its misuse in the  past, as was mentioned by Mr Brolly. I hope that the Minister will consider  those concerns.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Regarding the general issue of waste in East Londonderry,  Northern Ireland, like the rest of the United Kingdom, has, for many  years, been almost totally reliant on landfill for the disposal of its waste.  The EU landfill directive, which came into force in 1999, set binding targets  that restricted the amount of household waste that can be disposed of in  landfill sites. Furthermore, the directive required member states to draw up  plans to reduce the amount of other waste materials being disposed of in that  way. Those states, therefore, have had to reassess their waste management  practices, and to consider alternatives, such as increasing recycling and  recovery levels.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Northern    Ireland has tackled the issue of waste  management in a very positive manner. Following widespread consultation with  key stakeholder groups, we were the first part of the United Kingdom to develop a waste-management  strategy, setting out a vision of Northern Ireland as a centre of  excellence in resource and waste management.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The north-west region waste management plan, which has been  agreed by seven councils, has identified the need for a regional landfill site  to cater for the area&rsquo;s future needs. However, as Mr McQuillan stated, only two  of those councils have landfill sites currently in operation, namely Coleraine  and Magherafelt, and capacity in those two sites is limited. In the waste  management plan the &mdash; now closed &mdash; landfill site at Letterloan Road, Macosquin, which was  operated by Coleraine Borough Council, is identified as one of several  potential locations for the development of a mechanical biological treatment  (MBT) study, under the ownership/control of councils.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I will briefly mention the importance of waste prevention  in any waste management strategy for East Londonderry.  That should be high on the agenda, and a key priority for waste management.  Waste prevention includes all activities that reduce the amount of waste  entering the collected waste stream &mdash; for example, avoiding waste generation;  reducing the quantity and hazardous nature of waste at source; and re-using  products before they enter the waste stream.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The pressure on global resources is a major challenge for  Governments throughout the developed world, and was a key topic in the European  Commission&rsquo;s sixth Environment Action Programme. The thematic strategy on the  prevention and recycling of waste strongly emphasises the increasing importance  of waste-prevention measures in strategic waste planning. The landfill  directive places stringent targets on the diversion of biodegradable municipal  waste from landfill. Northern    Ireland produces some 1 million tons of  municipal waste annually, and that figure grew by 2&middot;5% between 2003 and 2004.  If the current rate continues, municipal waste arisings will increase by almost  50% by 2020, producing a significant gap between arisings and the amount we are  permitted to dispose of in landfill. Waste prevention will help us to meet our  targets by reducing the amount of residual waste requiring recycling and  recovery.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Now that devolution has been restored to Northern Ireland,  these are the problems that a functioning Executive can &mdash; and should &mdash; tackle  head on. More specifically, I return to Ringsend and Ballerin, and I trust that  the Minister will have ideas with which to tackle that particular issue.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>: I  thank Francie Brolly for bringing the motion before the Assembly, and I express  genuine thanks to the Minister for being here to take note and to respond. I  attended a public meeting in Ballerin last Thursday night. I have known the  people of that area for my whole life; they are the quietest, most inoffensive  people one could meet, but they were very angry &mdash; almost hostile &mdash; at that  meeting.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Perhaps no one could have envisaged what has happened here;  that there are four potential sites. I agree with those Members who said that  that is the nub of the problem.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I am pleased that Bairbre de Br&uacute;n is now involved &mdash; I had  to think for a moment who that was. The difficulty arose in the first place  because of the nasty and horrendous history of what can only be called a dump  on Craigmore Road.  Coleraine Borough Council officers were slow to take appropriate action to stop  it. I am not claiming that the Minister is responsible for history. She is not;  the system was woeful.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">On occasions I followed lorries and used my mobile phone to  alert people about what was happening, only to be told that I had to stop  because I was trespassing on private property. The site has been inherited by  the Environment and Heritage Service, of which I must be extremely critical.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister knows that in recent times there has been a  policy to remove waste and return it to its source. It was decided at that time  to cap up to, perhaps, 300,000 tons of toxic material. We have pictures to  prove that some of the waste came from hospitals.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">That is when the anger really began. Then, as Adrian  McQuillan mentioned, there was another site on the Belraugh Road &mdash; an area that I would  describe as one of outstanding natural beauty. To his credit, the present owner  carried out a massive planting scheme on it 20 years ago and it is now home to  a colony of wild animals. The site looks down on a beautiful plain. The last  thing that anyone would dream of would be to use it to as a landfill dump, even  for inert material.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">As for the site that the North West Region Waste Management  Group has chosen, I can now see a distinct disadvantage in joining such a  group. If a site is proposed in one of the council areas, the other five councils  will accept it, leaving the one pretty powerless to do anything about the  decision. The fact that probably all political parties were involved in  choosing a hole in the earth as a dump on our site means that there is no  political capital to be made.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Anyway, people in that community are utterly devastated.  One of the leaders called me today to suggest blocking roads, but I said such  action was outside the law and reminded the caller of the example of the  Parades Commission. We need to work with people.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">However, at the moment the community envisage an area akin  to East Germany  before the fall of the Berlin Wall. It is a tough task for the Minister, but  one that we depend on her to undertake. I know that she has not yet met the  group and I plead with her, on bended knee if necessary, to do so. Initially,  we had every confidence that she would.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister answered a question for me today on human  rights and how they relate to the clustering of landfill sites. However, while  her answer addresses the theory, I do not think that it will go down terribly  well with residents.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">Like David McClarty, I have a train to catch to Dublin, but I am so  interested in this that I will try not to break the speed limit on my way to  the station. I look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s response.</p>
		    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment (Mrs Foster)</strong>: I was a bit worried there, when the Member  was getting down on bended knee, but I think that I am safe enough.</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank Francie Brolly for raising this very important  issue and for the opportunity to discuss wider waste management issues in his  constituency. I would also like to thank colleagues who represent the  north-west for their useful contributions to the debate.</p>
		    <p class="TimePeriod">7.00 pm</p>
		    <p class="B3BodyText">I emphasise that any applications for a regional waste  facility must be considered against regional waste-management plans provided by  the three regional groups; the waste strategy&rsquo;s aims; and local residents&rsquo; needs and concerns. As the Minister responsible for planning, those issues are  important to me. I reassure Members that I will take them into account.</p>
