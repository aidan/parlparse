    <p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="a"></a>Assembly Business</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Resignation of Dr William McCrea</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I have received a letter from Dr William McCrea, notifying me that he will resign  as a Member of the Assembly with effect from Thursday 1 July 2010. I have  notified the Chief Electoral Officer.</p>
    <p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="b"></a>Ministerial Statement</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">British-Irish Council Summit: &nbsp;25 June 2010</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I have received notice from the Office of the First Minister and deputy First  Minister that the First Minister wishes to make a statement.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister (Mr P Robinson)</strong>: In accordance with the requirements of the  Northern Ireland Act 1998, I wish to report on the fourteenth summit meeting of  the British-Irish Council, which was held in Guernsey  on 25 June 2010. All Northern    Ireland Ministers who attended the summit  have agreed that I should make the statement to the Assembly on their behalf.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The States of Guernsey hosted the summit. The heads of  delegations were welcomed by the Chief Minister of Guernsey,  Deputy Lyndon Trott. The Irish Government were represented by the Taoiseach,  Brian Cowen TD, and the United Kingdom Government by the Secretary of State for  Northern Ireland,  the Rt Hon Owen Paterson MP. The Welsh Assembly Government were represented by  the First Minister for Wales,  the Rt Hon Carwyn Jones AM. The Scottish Government were represented by the  First Minister for Scotland,  the Rt Hon Alex Salmond MSP. The Government of Jersey  were represented by the Chief Minister, Senator Terence Le Sueur, and the Isle  of Man Government were represented by the Chief Minister, Tony Brown MHK. In  addition to the deputy First Minister and me, the Northern Ireland delegation  consisted of Minister Poots, Minister Attwood and junior Minister Newton. A  full list of participants is attached to the statement that has been provided  to Members.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The British-Irish Council plays a unique and important role  in furthering, promoting and developing links between its member  Administrations through positive, practical relationships and providing a forum  for consultation and co-operation on east-west issues. Member Administrations  consult, discuss and exchange information with each other on matters of mutual  interest within the competence of the relevant Administrations. The Chief  Minister of Guernsey, Deputy Lyndon Trott,  chaired the meeting, which focused on economic issues, marine renewable energy,  relations with the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, the establishment of a  standing secretariat and a report on progress within the various BIC work  sectors.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The BIC summit provided a useful forum for the Council to  review the current global economic climate and discuss the impact of the  downturn in economic activity across our respective Administrations. Ministers  briefed the Council on actions being taken in their respective Administrations  to stabilise public finances, repair banking systems, cut costs and boost  employment. We also discussed the potential impact of the recent Budget  announced by the United Kingdom Government. The Council acknowledged that  member Administrations continue to face serious challenges and agreed that the  sharing of information on their experiences, responses and best practice was  essential as they seek to reposition their economies to take advantage of the  economic upturn when it comes.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The main theme of the summit was marine renewable energy.  BIC Energy Ministers or their representatives updated the Council on the  activity under way in the area of marine renewables in their respective  Administrations and discussed areas for future co-operation and growth in that  sector among member Administrations and with the European Commission.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council noted the significant wave and tidal resources  of BIC member Administrations and the opportunities for growth and  competitiveness in that sector. It noted the benefits of member Administrations  working together to share best practice and collectively accelerate the  development of the marine renewable energy sector. The Council welcomed and  endorsed the progress and future work plan of the marine renewables subgroup of  the BIC energy work stream, including the continued exchange of best practice  on marine environment and research issues and the identification of key  opportunities for ongoing collaboration across Administrations.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council also approved ongoing and constructive  engagement between BIC member Administrations and the European Commission in  the development of European funding and policy initiatives in the area of  marine energy. The Council noted and welcomed the programme of work being taken  forward by the electricity grid infrastructure subgroup of the energy work  stream.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council considered a report prepared by the BIC  secretariat on the relationship between the British-Irish Council and the  British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, as mandated by the Council at its  thirteenth summit meeting in Jersey in  November 2009. The Council noted that there is scope for further engagement  between the bodies and approved a number of recommendations to enhance their  relationship. The Council tasked the BIC secretariat with taking forward work  on those recommendations in conjunction with the BIPA secretariat.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We discussed progress on arrangements for the establishment  of a BIC standing secretariat, which had been commissioned by the Council at  the Belfast  summit in July 2007. At the previous BIC summit in November 2009, the Council  asked the Chief Minister of Guernsey, as host of the following summit, to take  further informal soundings from Council members on a location for the  secretariat with a view to reaching consensus on a location and to report back  to the Council at the Guernsey summit. The  Chief Minister of Guernsey reported to the Council that, during his  consultations with member Administrations, consensus had emerged on a location  for the secretariat: Scotland.  The Council endorsed that consensus and tasked the BIC co-ordinating group with  taking forward work on the arrangements for establishing the secretariat in Scotland and  agreeing a model for sharing the costs associated with the establishment and  operation of the secretariat. Co-ordinators have been asked to provide a paper  setting out proposed arrangements for the Council to approve at the next summit  meeting, with a view to the secretariat being operational as soon as possible  thereafter. The Council has requested that the costs associated with the  standing secretariat be kept to a minimum.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council noted the progress of each of BIC&rsquo;s 11 work  sectors based on the reports of their respective working groups. The  collaborative spatial planning group brings together officials responsible for  regional development strategies, national planning strategies and frameworks in  each member Administration, and it met in March 2010 in Cardiff. There, the group had the opportunity  to hear from the Welsh Department with responsibility for public services and  local government on changes to European Union spatial policy objectives. The  group will next meet in Edinburgh in autumn 2010, when it will focus its work  on the practical issues for member Administrations arising from the mandatory  strategic environmental assessment of spatial frameworks.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The demography work group continues to be committed to the  work plan that was endorsed by the ministerial meeting in March 2008. The main  focus of the group&rsquo;s work has been on understanding migration and its impact.  The work stream&rsquo;s next area of focus will be on understanding the implications  of wider student flows among BIC member Administrations.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The digital inclusion work stream held its inaugural  meeting in September 2009 in the Isle of Man,  where it identified common themes in and shared understandings of digital  inclusion. The group decided to focus its work on five main areas: content,  outcomes, trust, engagement, and skills and training. The group has since met  on three occasions, most recently in Dublin  in May 2010, to take forward work in those areas. The theme of the next BIC  summit meeting will be digital inclusion.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In February 2009, the BIC Ministers with responsibility for  early years provision endorsed four strands of work for the work stream: collaboration  between all agencies concerned with health, education and social services, with  the aim of providing a joined-up service for children and their parents or  carers and making better use of resources; transition arrangements between home  and childcare settings and on to school to improve outcomes; the early years  workforce; and evaluation and obtaining better value for money. Initially, the  work of the group focused on the third strand. Officials from the early years  policy work sector met most recently in Jersey  in May 2010, and the group will now begin to focus on the fourth area, which is  value for money.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At the Council&rsquo;s twelfth summit in Cardiff on 20 February 2009, it agreed to the  introduction of a new energy work stream focused on two areas: electricity grid  infrastructure and marine renewables. The electricity grid aspect of the work  stream is led by the UK, and  the marine renewables aspect of the work stream is led by Scotland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The BIC electricity grid subgroup has met three times in  the past 12 months. Grid infrastructure was also the main focus of discussion  at the meeting of Energy Ministers in London  on 22 March 2010. At that meeting, BIC Ministers agreed that the electricity  grid subgroup would focus on exchanging information on and experience of  research and development and other studies to promote greater understanding of  and co-operation in electricity grid infrastructure; sharing experience of and  approaches to regulation; making environmental impact assessments and achieving  planning consent for electricity grid infrastructure; and working together to  exert greater influence on the direction of emerging EU policy on and funding  for grid infrastructure, where applicable to relevant members.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The first meeting of the marine renewables work stream was  held on 6 June 2009, and it met subsequently in November 2009 and January 2010.  The group continues to share best practice in research and development, policy  support and marine environment activities. As Members will have noted, marine  renewable energy was the main theme of the BIC summit. The environment work  stream continues to examine ways in which Governments, agencies and researchers  across BIC member Administrations can work together to improve the collective  understanding of impacts on the environment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The work stream includes two subgroups, which deal with  extreme weather events and integrated coastal zone management. It met in  February, April and June 2010. BIC Environment Ministers will meet in Newcastle, England,  in July 2010, when the main theme will be marine issues. The discussion will  focus on potential areas for future co-operation, such as how member  Administrations can support each other in working to implement European  directives, such as the marine framework strategy.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">10.45 am</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">An initial meeting of BIC officials took place in Belfast in June last year  on housing. The following issues were agreed as relevant across the  jurisdictions: changing demographics; greening the housing stock; affordable  housing; and investment in housing. The inaugural meeting of BIC Housing  Ministers took place in Newcastle, County Down,  on 4 December last year. The meeting focused on four main areas: changing  demographics; the need for more energy-efficient housing; greening the housing  stock; affordable housing products; and increasing private investment in  housing. The European Investment Bank and the Housing Finance Corporation made  presentations at that meeting.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Indigenous, minority and lesser-used languages were the  theme of the last BIC summit meeting held in Jersey  in November last year. At that summit, the Council endorsed the work of the  group and added the economic benefits of bilingualism to the group&rsquo;s remit. A  meeting of officials was held in Dublin in  December, at which it was agreed that the UK would lead the work on the  economic benefits of bilingualism. It was also agreed to establish a subgroup  to discuss the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages that would  look at member Administrations&rsquo; experiences of the monitoring process and share  best practice on monitoring progress and reporting it to the Council of Europe.  An inaugural meeting of that subgroup was held in Guernsey  in June. In February 2010, a seminar was held in Edinburgh by the legislation subgroup to  discuss linguistic legislation. That was organised by the Scottish Government,  who have chaired the legislation subgroup since it was established.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The misuse of drugs work stream met in Dublin in January 2010, and officials  discussed the policies of Administrations in tackling alcohol misuse. A  ministerial meeting of the work sector was hosted by the Isle   of Man on 24 February this year. Ministers discussed substance  misuse in the prison setting and the responses necessary to address that issue.  Ministers also discussed the issue of head shops and the use of psychoactive  substances &mdash; legal highs, as they are better known &mdash; enhancing information on  the various measures that are planned and implemented across jurisdictions and  the outcomes of those interventions. Work stream officials last met in London in June, where  they discussed new directions for drug and alcohol policy and meeting new  challenges. The group will next meet in Jersey  in September and will focus its discussion on community action in dealing with  drugs, alcohol and antisocial disorder.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At a ministerial meeting on social inclusion in Edinburgh on 25 and 26  March 2010, BIC Ministers reviewed the report on the work carried out by the  BIC social inclusion work stream on the contribution of the third sector to  social inclusion. Ministers noted that the third sector across all member  Administrations is complex and diverse, with significant social and economic  potential. They also acknowledged that the third sector has a reach to people  and communities that statutory agencies sometimes find more difficult to  engage. Ministers commended the excellent examples of investment and good  practice across all member Administrations. Ministers agreed that the theme had  led to a dynamic process of learning and co-operation, reflecting the original  intention of the BIC. The work sector met at official level last week in Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Work in the transport work stream has focused on the mutual  recognition of driving disqualifications, the mutual recognition of driving  offences that attract a penalty less than disqualification and research into  drugs and driving. Member Administrations are also working together in the area  of accessible transport. That work has included examining how to improve  information provision for disabled people who wish to travel from one  Administration area to another through the development of common web pages,  sharing standards of disability training schemes and scoping the current level  of concessionary travel across Administrations, while examining the potential  for mutual recognition. The next meeting of the accessible transport subgroup  will be held in London  in December 2010.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Finally &mdash; I thank my colleague for the water, but I may  need to be fed intravenously because of the length of this statement &mdash; Members  will wish to note that the Council agreed to hold the next BIC summit in  December 2010, when it will be hosted by the Isle of Man Government.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee for the Office of the First Minister and deputy  First Minister (Dr Farry)</strong>: This is my debut in my new role, and I will  endeavour to reflect what I understand to be the key issues for the Committee,  even though I have not yet attended a Committee meeting. I thank the First  Minister for his statement, and I welcome the quick turnaround in his  delivering it, particularly given the statement&rsquo;s detailed content, which is  also welcome.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The First Minister referred to the report that the BIC  secretariat prepared on the relationship between the British-Irish Council and  the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly. Will he give us some flavour of the  report&rsquo;s recommendations?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Members will welcome greatly the interest that has been  shown in the early years policy, which is a cross-cutting issue. In the light  of the emerging conclusions, will the First Minister tell the House whether we  can look forward to some of the recommendations being reflected in our thinking  on the future Programme for Government and Budget?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Marine renewable energy was a major theme of the  discussions. Are we likely to see DETI&rsquo;s strategic energy framework finalised  and the outcomes of the discussions reflected in other local policies?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I congratulate the Member on his new role. Given that he managed  to ask that number of questions without ever having been to an OFMDFM Committee  meeting, I fear for the time when he is fully equipped in his new role and has  his legs fully under the table.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank my officials for the quick turnaround in preparing  the statement. We respect the role of the Assembly, so we thought it vital to  deliver the statement today before the Assembly rises for the summer recess. We  therefore asked our officials to cancel all their evening engagements over the  past number of days.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Perhaps I should say what the relationship between the BIC  and the parliamentary Assembly will not be: it will not be the kind of  relationship that the Executive have with the Assembly; rather, it will be much  more a co-operative relationship. We will obviously share various outcomes, and  the parliamentary Assembly will undoubtedly want to look at some of the same  issues at which the BIC looks. The two bodies will have lots of possibilities  to aid each other, and the BIC will look at some of the reports that the  parliamentary Assembly undertakes. I hope that there will be a close working  relationship between the two bodies.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member asked whether the lessons that other  Administrations learn will be reflected in our policies and Budget. Such  learning is the very purpose of the BIC setting. At BIC summits, we hear about  the experiences of Ministers from other Administrations, and, as a result, we  can make some assessment of the value that those Ministers place on work that  they have done and determine whether there is a read-across to Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  circumstances. There will be some experiences that we do not wish to share, but  it will be good to know about them because that will mean that others learn the  lesson for us. In other cases, we will want to incorporate good practice that  has been developed elsewhere into our Programme for Government and Budget  requirements.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Spratt</strong>:  I, too, thank the Minister for his statement on the British-Irish Council  summit meeting. The House will recall the UK Government&rsquo;s obstruction of the  location of the BIC standing secretariat at the Jersey  summit late last year. I welcome the now unanimous decision of the Council to  locate its secretariat in Scotland.  Will the Minister tell us what steps will be taken in the near future to  establish the secretariat?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First Minister</strong>:  As I said in my statement, we tasked officials with taking forward that  important issue as far back as at the summit meeting in Belfast in 2007. We have been pressing for  the establishment of a standing secretariat for a considerable time. A BIC  secretariat completes the various bodies that are located on the periphery of  the Assembly at a North/South and an east-west level. We know from North/South  experiences that a secretariat gives focus and drive to the work that is being  done. We, therefore, hope that that is replicated in the east-west body.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We are delighted that Scotland was successful in its bid  to host the secretariat. To put it bluntly, the change in the UK Government  assisted in getting that issue resolved. At the Jersey  meeting, everybody except the UK Government agreed on the location. Now, it has  been endorsed by the new the coalition Government and, therefore, we can move  ahead.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have already agreed the skeleton form of the secretariat  and the parameters within which it will work. The Scottish Administration  indicated that they have already looked at the cost and have seen areas in  which savings could be made. A paper, which will be provided by our officials,  will determine the apportionment of costs between the member Administrations. We  will discuss that, not, I hope, in a heated way, at the next meeting.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Anderson</strong>:  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat. I thank the First Minister for that detailed  statement. I assure him that the new Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for  the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister will have his work  cut out trying to ask questions, because we are all a bit lippy in that  Committee.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When will the North next host a plenary meeting of the BIC?  Will consideration be given to that meeting taking place in Derry?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I should not do what I am about to do because there are dangers  in saying something off the top of one&rsquo;s head. However, it surely must be next  year that we host the plenary meeting. There is a meeting on the Isle of Man in December, and I can think of no other  Administration who have not had their turn, which usually comes round every  three years. I am getting nods from the Officials&rsquo; Box &mdash; I am not supposed to  mention it &mdash; indicating that I have guessed right. We would be happy to welcome  all member Administrations to Northern    Ireland in 2011.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Elliott</strong>:  I thank the First Minister for his statement and for bringing it to the House  so quickly. There have been rumours of a possible takeover bid of NIE by the  Republic of Ireland Government-controlled ESB. Did that form any part of the  discussions at the BIC?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: That did not come up during the summit. However, if that is a  rumour or more than a rumour, it may come up at the ministerial meetings.  Therefore, I will draw it to the attention of my colleague to ensure that he  gets a reply as to whether the Department is aware of anything.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I thank the First Minister for a comprehensive and thorough report on the BIC  summit meeting. Momentarily, I thought that Ms Anderson was going to suggest  that the secretariat be situated in Derry.  However, she did not come forward with that recommendation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">One area of great interest is marine energy, which we are  ideally situated to exploit. There is huge potential for Northern Ireland and, indeed, Ireland as a  whole. Will the First Minister expand on the collaboration that he would  envisage among the various Administrations throughout these islands so that we  can benefit from that?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I should point out that Northern Ireland made an early bid  for the standing secretariat to be based here. However, we are all very content  with the placing of the secretariat in Edinburgh,  in Scotland.  Accessibility to the venue for all Administrations was a key factor, as was  cost.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In relation to marine renewables and as the Member  indicated, when it comes to wind and waves, Northern Ireland is in the premier  league, probably vying with Scotland for the top position.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">We have our own experiences in Strangford Lough,  where we have probably achieved a world first, in getting a commercial project  connected to the grid.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.00 am</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It was indicated during the meeting that 50% of wave stream  potential for the whole of Europe comes from  the countries that were involved in the BIC summit. Marine renewables has not  been a big issue in the European Community. There was, therefore, a collective  agreement that we would make it a big issue with regard to funding and other  European issues. I suppose the fact that these regions hold 50% of wave stream  potential may be the reason why other regions have not been pushing the issue,  but that is no reason why we should not.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Obviously, Scotland  has a particular knowledge in that area, and the work group is going into great  detail so that we can learn from each other. We have to recognise that the  technology is reasonably costly at present. As time goes on, however, we will  get more for less, and that will be the outcome as we work in collaboration.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Some of my party&rsquo;s theological scholars may be able to tell  me on what day God created the wind and waves. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span> We are talking about some of the oldest elements, and if we could put new  technology to the oldest elements, we would have something very sustainable in  the long term. Although some of my ministerial colleagues may want us to take  the fuels from hell, whether oil or coal, I much prefer to take the fuels from  heaven, whether the wind or the sun, or somewhere in between; that is, the  waves. There is massive potential in marine renewables, which we have to  garner.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Browne</strong>:  Looking at the list of delegates, the Guernsey  summit appears to have been well attended. However, I notice the absence of the  Prime Minister. Does the First Minister agree that the absence of the Prime  Minister does not sit well with his respect agenda towards the devolved  Administrations?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: We would have welcomed the presence of the Prime Minister, or,  indeed, the Deputy Prime Minister. Preparations were going on for the G20  summit in Canada,  so we will gracefully give him a bye ball on this occasion, although we  obviously think that the BIC summit would have been more important for him to  attend. However, the Secretary of State indicated that the Prime Minister is  expected at the Isle of Man summit, so we look  forward to seeing him there. Of course, the Prime Minister attended the Joint  Ministerial Committee meeting and, indeed, invited us to Downing   Street for that. I hope that that will be the pattern that he will  follow.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh r&aacute;iteas an Aire.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the statement from the First Minister. Like  Stephen Farry, I would have liked to have heard more detail about the specific  recommendations about the closer future working relationship between the  British-Irish Council and the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly. Committee D  of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly did a very worthwhile report on  health inequalities suffered by the Irish community in Britain.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Will the First Minister ensure that a wider range of  language expert bodies will be invited to attend future meetings of the languages  subgroup? No representative groups from the North were invited to take part in  its previous meeting.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, did this Administration bid to host the BIC  secretariat, or were we happy to endorse the Scottish bid?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: In actual fact, the answer is both. We were one of four  Administrations that put in a bid for the secretariat. It seems that, had we  been successful, we may have had some issues about where it would be sited in Northern Ireland.  As a result of the complex procedures, whether proportional representation or  whatever, Scotland  ended up being the most favoured choice, and is now the unanimous choice of the  Council.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I take on board the Member&rsquo;s reference to minority  languages. The Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure was present at the Jersey summit and spoke extensively on that. We want to  play our full part in any work stream that is under way.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The paper agreed at the summit sets out the distinct roles  and functions of the British-Irish Council and the British-Irish Parliamentary  Assembly. The Council noted that there is scope for further engagement between  the bodies and approved a number of recommendations to enhance their  relationship. The Council tasked the BIC secretariat with taking forward work  on those recommendations in conjunction with the BIPA secretariat. We welcome  the enhanced co-operation between the bodies and the regular exchange of public  documents, and we look forward to receiving relevant reports from BIPA. The new  BIC standing secretariat is well placed to administer and co-ordinate responses  to BIPA committee reports. There may, however, be occasions when an individual  response may be appropriate &mdash; for example, when a report relates to issues that  are specific to an individual member Administration.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>: I  thank the First Minister for his statement. I note that the Department of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety has not commenced the child  protection work stream. Was the Health Minister in attendance to explain to  other member Administrations why there has been inaction on that important  issue?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: As the attendance list indicates, the Health Minister was not  present. Again, I take the risk of working off the top of my head, but I recall  that the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety previously  gave reasons for not contributing to the Baby P case. That case has now gone  through the courts, so we will attempt to get some further explanation from the  Department and advise the Member accordingly.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I,  too, thank the First Minister for his prompt report. He said that head shops  and so-called legal highs were discussed under the heading of substance misuse.  Will the First Minister tell us whether the spot-listing of designer drugs was  discussed? We recently suffered an epidemic of mephedrone use in Northern Ireland  and found that it took three or four months to have that drug banned. Can we  develop this idea so that we can follow the good practice of the USA and New Zealand and be one step ahead  of the international criminal gangs?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: The issue came up at the Council only by way of a documentary  report on all the work streams, so it was not discussed. There would have been  considerable discussion on all those issues during the ministerial meetings on  the subjects. I will draw attention to the Member&rsquo;s remarks so that the  Minister can respond directly. However, as he outlined, that is precisely why  the work streams exist and why the Council meets.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  I, too, welcome the First Minister&rsquo;s statement and his swiftness in bringing it  to the House. He referred to the fact that the secretariat will be based in Scotland and  that a model was agreed for sharing the costs. Does he have any details of what  Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  contribution will be? Will he advise the House what lessons this Administration  can learn from others in responding to the cuts in public expenditure?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: To answer the first part of the question on the apportionment of  the overall costs of the standing secretariat: officials will draw up a paper  and attempt to reconcile every Administration&rsquo;s desire to pay as little as  possible. No figures have been set beside any of the Administrations as yet. We  will want to ensure that we are asked to contribute a fair and reasonable  amount.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As one might expect, we spent a considerable time  discussing economic issues, particularly in relation to the three devolved  Administrations, with a view to trying to make the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland  aware of the difficulties that we face because of the United Kingdom Budget.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At BIC summits, I usually find that much of the best and  most valuable work takes place in the evening non-sessions rather than at the  Council meetings. The deputy First Minister and I met the First Ministers of  Scotland and Wales.  We discussed how we would each try to deal with the cuts and whether we could  learn lessons from one another. The deputy First Minister and I will speak to  ministerial colleagues about those issues, and, along with the Finance Minister,  I hope that we will be able to reach a satisfactory conclusion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  Like other Members, I thank the First Minister and acknowledge the speed and  efficiency with which the statement has been brought to the Assembly this  morning before we break for the summer recess.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">All BIC participants live on islands, some larger than  others, so we all have an interest in the protection of our precious coastline.  I want to raise the issue of collaborative spatial planning. I am glad that our  Environment Minister was at the BIC meeting. Will the First Minister, the  deputy First Minister or whoever is responsible do whatever is necessary to  ensure that our coastline is protected from unnecessary and unwanted  development, and from coastal erosion?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First Minister</strong>:  The Member, along with colleagues, has drawn attention to the quick turnaround  time and quality of the statement. I take no credit for that, but bounce it on  to the people in the Officials&rsquo; Box who did the hard work.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s coastline is not extensive, but it  is a precious resource. It is precious to the fishing and tourism industries,  and, as we will see in the future, it is precious because of its energy  potential. There can be conflicts &mdash; for example, between tourism and offshore  wind energy &mdash; so balances will always have to be struck. However, I will pass  on the Member&rsquo;s remarks to the Environment Minister. During the summit, there  was no discussion on coastline issues other than in the context of energy, but  the Minister will deal with that subject at the ministerial meetings.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Givan</strong>: I  thank the First Minister for his statement, which touched on the marine renewables  sector. Will he join me in commending Queen&rsquo;s University, which is at the  cutting edge of research on wave power and is working with the Scottish  Government in developing that technology off the Orkney   Islands? With Scotland,  Northern Ireland  can drive the agenda on marine renewables. If we can harness the technology, Northern Ireland  has enough power off its north coast to generate the same amount of energy as  two existing power stations. There is a great opportunity to develop new green  jobs &mdash; in the sense of wind energy jobs.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I am happy to concur with the issues that the Member identified,  including the contribution of Queen&rsquo;s University and its collaboration with the  Scottish Government. If we are going to pat local resources on the back,  Harland and Wolff should be included because of its involvement in the  Strangford scheme. Yet again, that demonstrates that local expertise can be  utilised.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.15 am</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Of course, we want to develop our marine renewables  potential quickly and as best we can. It is an emerging industry that will  create what the Member described as &ldquo;green jobs&rdquo;. I hope that green and orange  jobs will flow from it, but it is vital that we openly communicate what is and  is not working so that all Administrations benefit. The Scottish Administration  have considerable experience in that area. They lead the work group and are  probably ahead of the field in the context of marine renewables, so we can  learn much from them.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  The First Minister said:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Work in the Transport work stream has focused on the  mutual recognition of driving disqualifications; the mutual recognition of  driving offences that attract a penalty less than disqualification&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Will the First Minister elaborate on that? Is that  work concerned with trying to have some cohesion with other regions of the United Kingdom and with the Republic of Ireland,  whereby those who are banned from driving here will have that ban reflected in  the Republic of Ireland and vice versa?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: I am not sure whether the Member wishes to declare an interest in  that subject, but the work stream will deal with that issue and with penalty  points. The matter was not discussed during the meeting, but it was in a  written report. Our own Minister will take that matter forward with the work  stream at a ministerial level.</p>
    <p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="c"></a>Executive Committee Business</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Bill: Second Stage</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment (Mr Poots)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That the Second Stage of the Clean Neighbourhoods and  Environment Bill [NIA 31/09] be agreed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I say with some confidence that this is a Bill that is to  be welcomed by all Members, despite the fact that quite a few of them are  leaving the Chamber. The Bill signals the start of work on a clean  neighbourhoods legislative programme that is designed to improve the quality of  local environments right across Northern    Ireland. That includes those in our local  neighbourhoods, villages, towns and cities and those in rural and coastal  areas. The Bill will have an impact on all of Northern   Ireland and its people and on all those who visit Northern Ireland.  I will focus on why we need the Bill, what it will do, and how, through it, we  can make a real difference to the lives of everyone in Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">First, why do we need the Bill? Its main purpose is to  contribute to everyone&rsquo;s quality of life by encouraging clean and tidy  neighbourhoods and by helping to engender a sense of pride among residents.  People feel safer in such neighbourhoods and feel more at ease in their local  surroundings. When looked at in isolation, many of the issues that the Bill  seeks to address may seem trivial to some, but individually and collectively,  they are real problems for those who must endure their impact.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill deals with a wide range of low-level environmental  crime, such as littering, dog fouling, graffiti and fly-posting. It also deals  with the nuisance that is caused by noise, poorly directed artificial lighting,  abandoned vehicles and irresponsible parking, abandoned shopping trolleys, and  even unwanted behaviour in back alleys. It aims to address directly many  day-to-day problems that, left untouched, are the forerunner to a downward  spiral that degrades local neighbourhoods, leads to increased levels of  antisocial behaviour and serves to cause local residents only misery. None of  us wants to live in an area that is blighted by low-level environmental crime.  We want to live in areas that are clean and safe. The number one priority for  many people is to have streets that are clean and free from antisocial  behaviour and the fear of crime. Good-quality, clean and tidy local environments  attract more investment and have a positive impact on our health, well-being,  confidence and civic pride.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill will help to bring about positive benefits for  tourism by reducing antisocial behaviour and by making all of us think more  about the environment in which we live. It should also help to reduce the  massive street-cleaning costs that district councils face. For those reasons, I  believe that the Bill is a very important piece of legislation. For example, it  will show that the Assembly intends, through the introduction of stronger  legislation and higher fines, to get tough with those who continue to litter  and deface our streets and public spaces.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I said, the Bill signals the start of work on the agenda  for our clean neighbourhoods legislative programme. In consulting on the draft  Bill earlier this year, stakeholders called for the Bill to do more. Full  details of the comments that were received during that consultation exercise,  as well as my Department&rsquo;s responses, are set out in the consultation summary  document, which is available on the Department&rsquo;s website.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although I am sympathetic to calls for the Bill to do more,  it should be viewed as an important starting point. It is based on  well-established legislation, namely, the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment  Act 2005, which is in force in other parts of the United Kingdom. The powers that it  provides to local authorities are proving to be a key tool in their efforts to  further improve the quality of their local environment. The proposed Bill will  give broadly similar powers to district councils in Northern   Ireland, which have been calling for them since the 2005  Act came into force in England  and Wales.  The Bill will be supported by extensive subordinate legislation and a clean  neighbourhoods guidance programme. Furthermore, the implementation of the  measures in the Bill by district councils will have to be monitored to assess  their effectiveness and to allow consideration of the need for any significant  additional measures to be introduced in the future.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Despite the excellent efforts of district councils in  tackling low-level environmental crime and the ongoing campaigns designed to  encourage society to change its ways, Northern Ireland district councils  still needlessly spend millions of pounds on cleaning up their local  neighbourhoods. Last year, a staggering &pound;34 million was spent on street  cleansing in Northern    Ireland. That amounts to almost &pound;100,000  every day. That is not only a burden on ratepayers, but a sheer waste of a  significant sum of money that could be used to much better effect on other  important council services. Therefore, most people should accept that the Bill,  which is designed to improve the appearance and cleanliness of public spaces  and local neighbourhoods, is necessary.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The scale of the litter problem beggars belief. Some  Members may be aware of the efforts made by the &lsquo;Belfast Telegraph&rsquo; and Tidy  Northern Ireland through the Big Spring Clean campaign. Earlier this year, I  joined the campaign on a visit, with a group of dedicated conservation  volunteers, to help to clear up litter in outer Belfast. What should have been a beautiful  and scenic open space to be enjoyed by the local community, young and old  alike, was ruined by unacceptable levels of litter, including plastic bags,  paper bags, broken glass, empty bottles, used nappies and crisp packets, all of  which were clearly visible. In a short space of time, we collected more than 30  black bin bags full of litter.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We all know the sorts of issues that I am targeting; we see  the problems all too easily and all too often. Chewing gum, cigarette ends and  confectionary litter are significant problems that blight the appearance of  footpaths in towns and cities. Illegal fly-posting and graffiti are eyesores  that seem to appear on every piece of street furniture and even on the walls of  private property. Irresponsible dog ownership gives rise to dog fouling, which,  at best, is unpleasant and, at worst, represents a health hazard.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I said, those issues also cost the councils money. In  the UK,  it is estimated that it costs &pound;150 million a year to clean up chewing gum.  Belfast City Council estimated that, in 2008-09, it spent approximately  &pound;500,000 on the removal of chewing gum, graffiti and fly-posters. However, the  Bill deals with more than litter, graffiti and dog-fouling. Other, equally  important issues, such as noise nuisance and the problems that are caused by  poorly directed domestic artificial lighting, affect the quality of people&rsquo;s  lives in local neighbourhoods.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have established why the Bill is important, and I shall  now outline what it will do. The Bill will give district councils the power to  deal with issues much more effectively. As interested Members will appreciate,  it is a sizeable and complex Bill, which will, in many instances, make detailed  amendments to existing legislation, such as the Litter (Northern Ireland)  Order 1994.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will outline the key provisions. Litter continues to be a  major concern for many people in Northern Ireland, as it reduces  their quality of life by degrading public spaces and local neighbourhoods. The  Bill will strengthen the existing law to enable district councils to deal more  effectively with a range of litter problems. It will give councils strong new  powers, such as litter clearing notices, which will require businesses and  individuals to clear litter from their land. It will strengthen the councils&rsquo;  existing powers to require local businesses, through the issue of street litter  control notices, to help to clear up the litter that they generate. It will  strengthen the provisions to deal with people who fail to provide their name  and address. It will amend the offence of dropping litter in a lake, pond or  watercourse, and it will enable councils to restrict the distribution of  flyers, handouts and pamphlets, which can end up as litter.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Fly-posting and graffiti are visual signs of neglect and  degradation in a local environment, particularly in our inner cities and towns.  The Bill will strengthen the existing law to enable district councils to deal  more effectively with fly-posting and graffiti. It will give councils the  ability to issue fixed penalty notices to graffiti and fly-posting offenders,  and it will enable councils to serve defacement removal notices in respect of  graffiti and fly-posting. It will also make it an offence to sell spray paints  to children, and it will strengthen the legislation to make it harder for  beneficiaries of fly-posting to evade prosecution.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Irresponsible dog ownership continues to be a problem in Northern Ireland.  The Bill will introduce new arrangements for controlling dogs by replacing the  local by-laws system with a more streamlined and straightforward system that is  easier for district councils to operate. The new simplified system of dog  control orders will enable councils to deal with fouling by dogs, to ban dogs  from designated areas, to require dogs to be kept on a lead and to restrict the  number of dogs that can be walked by one person.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Excessive noise is still regarded as a major problem by  members of the public. In 2008-09, there were over 11,000 complaints about  noise, over 80% of which related to domestic noise. Noise from music,  television and parties, and animal noise, such as barking dogs, remain the  major reasons for complaints in the domestic category. Although there was a  small reduction in the overall number of domestic noise complaints compared  with 2007-08, there was a 26% increase in the number of complaints about house  alarms. The Bill will give district councils new powers to deal with audible  intruder alarms and the noise nuisance that is caused by false alarms when a  keyholder is away. The 2008-09 period also saw a 30% increase in the level of  complaints in respect of noise from entertainment premises over those that were  received in 2007-08. The Bill will amend the Noise Act 1996 in relation to  noise from private premises by extending its provisions to noise from licensed  premises. That change is designed to deal with licensed premises that ignore  warnings to reduce excessive noise.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The existing statutory noise law is over 130 years old.  Despite having been amended from time to time, the definition of what can be  considered a statutory nuisance and the enforcement powers that are available  to district councils have not kept pace with developments in statutory nuisance  legislation that applies outside Northern Ireland. The Bill will  introduce provisions that apply in England  and Wales  as amended by the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005. One outcome  will be that district councils will, for the first time, be able to take action  to deal with complaints concerning problems caused by poorly directed  artificial lighting, which is sometimes referred to as light pollution.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Fixed penalty notices or on-the-spot fines are a simple and  visible way of dealing with environmental offences. If used properly, they  provide an effective deterrent and avoid the cost of court action. At present,  fixed penalty notices can be issued for littering and dog fouling offences and  some noise violation offences. The Bill will make greater use of fixed penalty  notices as an alternative to prosecution and will give district councils the  flexibility, subject to upper and lower limits, to set their own fixed penalty  rates. The provisions in the Bill will extend the use of fixed penalty notices  for offences relating to nuisance vehicles, litter controls, other dog  controls, additional noise controls, and graffiti and fly-posting. The Bill  also makes a provision that will enable district councils to use the money received  from the fixed penalty notices that they issue in connection with their  functions to improve local environmental quality.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic" align="center" style="text-align:center;">(Mr Deputy  Speaker [Mr McClarty] in the Chair)</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is interesting to note that after the Clean  Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005 was introduced in England, the  number of fixed penalty notices that were issued for litter offences increased  significantly from 7,565 in 2003-04 to 43,624 in 2006-07, which is a five-fold  increase. That not only acted as a deterrent but the value of the fixed  penalties that were issued could have returned over &pound;2 million of funding to  further support councils&rsquo; efforts to improve their neighbourhoods.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Back alleys or entries can attract a range of antisocial  and environmental problems that reduce the quality of life in our local  neighbourhoods. They can be magnets for litter, fly-tipping, abandoned vehicles  and graffiti offenders. They can also attract other problems, such as domestic  burglary and drug dealing, and can make the lives of local residents a misery.  The Bill contains provisions to make more effective the existing procedure for  the closing of nuisance back alleys.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.30 am</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill contains amendments to the Roads (Northern Ireland)  Order 1993 to give effect to gating order provisions. That will give district  councils new powers to make, with the approval of the Department for Regional  Development, gating orders to deal with problem alleyways. The Minister for Regional  Development has policy responsibility for that legislation and has agreed those  provisions in the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">District councils will also be given new powers to deal  with nuisance parking for businesses that sell or repair cars on a road. Such  vehicles can be a nuisance: they can reduce parking opportunities and cause  pollution &mdash; for example, where oil is spilled or leaked. Two new offences will  be created: offering for sale two or more vehicles or repairing a vehicle on  the road as part of a business. Abandoned cars can degrade streets, are linked  to criminal activity and can become targets for antisocial behaviour and arson.  The Bill will give district councils the power to remove abandoned cars from  the streets immediately.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am sure that we have all come across abandoned shopping  trolleys, which are an all-too-visible problem that affects the quality of our  streets and public spaces. They can also be a hazard. When they are dumped in  watercourses, they can form an obstruction and create particular problems for  drainage, which may cause flooding or harm to wildlife. The Bill will give  district councils the power to recover the costs of dealing with abandoned  shopping trolleys from their owners.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill increases the maximum fine from &pound;30,000 to &pound;50,000  on summary conviction that may be provided for in regulations made under  pollution prevention and control provisions in the Environment (Northern Ireland)  Order 2002. That will enable maximum fines on summary conviction in the  Pollution Prevention and Control Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2003 &mdash; that  could concern, for example, contravention of the requirement for a permit to  operate an installation or mobile plant, failure to comply with or contravene a  condition of a permit and failure to comply with the requirements of an  enforcement notice or a suspension notice &mdash; to be brought into line with the  equivalent maximum fines for illegal waste activity set out in the Waste and  Contaminated Land (Northern Ireland) Order 1997. To ensure consistency in that  area of regulation, the increase to &pound;50,000 also brings the level of fine into  line with that applying in England  and Wales.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have established why we need the Bill and what it will  do, so we must ask ourselves how it can make a difference. As I said at the start  of my speech, the Bill is sizeable and complex, and its purpose is, quite  simply, to make Northern Ireland  a better place in which to live. For many people, the Bill will help to ensure  that the day-to-day local and environmental problems that they face will be  dealt with more effectively than previously, thereby bringing about real  improvements in their quality of life. However, legislation is not the only  answer. If the Bill is to make a difference, it must form a platform for  leadership. We need leadership from people and communities, local politicians,  businesses and government in all their forms. I already mentioned the good work  carried out by the &lsquo;Belfast Telegraph&rsquo; and Tidy Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will conclude with a comment that was reported in the  &lsquo;Belfast Telegraph&rsquo; made by a primary-school pupil who took part in the big spring clean event.  He spoke about the litter and graffiti around the streets and how it was not a  nice place in which to live. However, he added that, after the children had completed  their clean-up, he felt happy. In my view, that says it all and encapsulates  what the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Bill is all about. The Bill can  and will help to tackle the wide range of local and environmental problems that  spoil the appearance of our neighbourhoods and, in doing so, will improve the  quality of life for all the people in Northern Ireland. However, it will  need the support of the people of Northern Ireland and of the  Assembly to do that. I commend the Bill to the Assembly.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for the Environment (Mr Boylan)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a  LeasCheann Comhairle. Mar Chathaoirleach an Choiste Comhshaoil, cuirim f&aacute;ilte  roimh an Bhille um comharsanachta&iacute; glana agus an comhshaol.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Bill,  which is comprehensive, with 76 clauses and four schedules. It has been  introduced to reflect the growing calls from elected representatives, district  councils, environmental groups and individuals for the introduction of similar  legislation to that in England  and Wales.  The main objective of the Bill is to improve the local environment by giving  district councils additional powers to deal with litter, nuisance alleys,  graffiti and fly-posting, abandoned and nuisance vehicles, dogs, noise and  statutory nuisance. Such issues are important to people in their everyday life  and, as such, are brought to the attention of elected representatives almost  daily. I am glad that the Minister decided to introduce the legislation,  although the Committee noted its disappointment that the Department had taken  so long to do so and insisted that a lack of resources was not an acceptable  reason for the delay. Although most of the issues that the legislation covers  are of a relatively minor nature when considered in isolation, the cumulative  cost of addressing them through current provisions is significant.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Departmental officials briefed the Committee on the policy  proposals on 11 February 2010. Members generally welcomed the proposals, as  they will address the cumulative impact of many smaller issues and  significantly improve many citizens&rsquo; quality of life. However, some concerns  were raised. Members noted that there might be difficulties in enforcing the  new powers at council level, especially if enforcers are on their own at night,  without backup. Verbal and physical abuse could become more prevalent,  especially once fixed penalties are introduced. Enforcement is crucial for any  legislation to be effective, and, although I am well aware of the huge financial  constraints on all public bodies at the moment, adequate resources must be  given to councils to ensure effective enforcement.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee welcomes the need to increase powers to  address problems with stray dogs but feels that councils should be encouraged  to persuade animal welfare groups to intervene, where possible, so that the new  powers do not lead to an increase in the number of dogs that are destroyed.  There is also a feeling that the Department needs to work closely with the  Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD) on measures to reduce  problems with stray dogs.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Everyone is well aware of the scourge of advertising  leaflets, which are either foisted on people as they walk through towns or  stuck under their windscreen wiper. Members welcome the proposals in the Bill  to allow local authorities to put in place controls that limit where  advertising leaflets can be distributed. We particularly welcome the inclusion  of car parks as one such location. Anybody who looks around a car park when  returning to his or her vehicle will see many discarded advertising leaflets.  The Bill should go some way to stopping the practice.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee was told that the Department considers the  Bill to be cost-neutral and that the revenue from fixed penalty notices will  return to local authorities. In the current economic climate, that is welcome.  Members were also pleased to learn that the Bill is designed to give councils  powers that they can adopt as necessary. That should provide the necessary  flexibility to put in place measures that are tailored to local areas,  including, where necessary, powers to address problems that are unique to rural  areas. As an elected representative who serves a rural constituency, I welcome  that development.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will now make some remarks as a private Member. I welcome  the provisions on dogs offences in the Bill. However, DARD also has a role to  play. Stray dogs still affect many council areas. That is totally unacceptable,  and I hope that regulations will go some way to addressing the problem.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Many tourists complain about the amount of litter that is  dropped, especially in rural areas. I hope that fixed penalties will address  the problem. Does the Minister intend to consider giving some resources to  local residents&rsquo; groups so that they might help tackle the problem in their  area?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the proposed introduction of gating orders. A  major issue arises with them, however. Although the measure is welcome, it will  certainly restrict people&rsquo;s movement. In my area, some alley-gating has been  done. However, alley-gating leads to antisocial behaviour and dumping, which  the Minister mentioned. If the legislation is to work, conclusive consultation  must take place among residents, local groups and utility providers to get it  right.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Abandoned cars are another problem. Will the Minister look  into the nuisance that cars and lorries parked on the footpath cause? I know  that that falls under DRD&rsquo;s remit, but there may be an opportunity for the  Minister to consider the issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As soon as the House commends the Bill to the Committee, we  will call for written submissions from interested organisations and  individuals. Committee members will be extremely interested to hear their  views. I look forward to having a good ongoing working relationship with  departmental officials to ensure that the Committee is able to scrutinise the  legislation properly. Thar ceann an Choiste, taca&iacute;m le prionsabail an Bhille.  On behalf of the Committee, I support the Bill&rsquo;s principles.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: I  am glad to speak to the Bill, which has been brought forward by a DUP Minister.  There is an awful lot in the Bill for us to get our teeth into in Committee.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Many local communities in Northern Ireland are plagued by  litter, noise, fly-tipping, dog fouling, abandoned vehicles and all the issues  that the Minister and the Chairperson of the Committee mentioned. Indeed, at  the end of the Chairperson&rsquo;s speech, he said that tourists noticed that there  is a lot of litter here. We have discussed that issue in Committee and in the  Assembly, during the debate on the Ulster Unionist Party motion on Tidy  Northern Ireland Day. Much discussion took place on the cultural and  attitudinal changes that need to take place among individuals here. It is hard  not to think about personal responsibility when discussing the issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not think that any Members will not have dealt with  such issues in their constituency. I have dealt with a number of issues and  been frustrated by the lack of powers that councils have and the lack of action  that they can take. Therefore, the Bill, which gives local councils the powers  that they need, is welcome. I support the Bill in principle, which is what we  are asked to do at Second Stage. In our initial discussions, the Committee gave  a general welcome to the Bill and looked forward to considering it in more detail.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The outcome that we all want for communities and local  areas is healthier and cleaner communities and, ultimately, happier  neighbourhoods. The littering, dog fouling and fly-tipping that we have  discussed impacts on the quality of life of many residents. It impacts on the  quality of life of neighbours throughout the country and of people who live in  misery because of dumping by a few. The actions of a few really are impacting  on the many.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister talked about the huge costs of street cleaning  and of getting shopping trolleys out of rivers and lakes. We want to ensure  that ratepayers get value for money, because the costs that councils currently  pay to clean up litter and abandoned cars and trolleys is passed on to the  ratepayer. Ultimately, it is innocent people who pay for councils to clean up,  and that must be addressed. As a general rule, I support the polluter pays  principle, whether that applies to individuals or businesses. People have to  take personal responsibility, and they have to take on the costs for clearing  up the mess that they have made. That is an important principle.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister talked about the increased use of fixed  penalty notices. A number of weeks ago, the Committee for Justice discussed a  move towards having more fixed penalty notices, and that is a beneficial  direction to take. It saves many minor offences from clogging up the courts. As  long as enforcement is carried out properly and people pay their fines, fixed  penalty notices are the way to go. My one warning is that, because the councils  are able to keep much of the revenue from the fines that they give out, some  overzealous council officials might use that as a way of generating income for  councils. When looking at the Bill&rsquo;s detail, we will need to ensure that strict  upper and lower limits are placed on the fines and that it contains details on  how councils can collect the fines.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Chairman talked about advertising being placed under  window wipers in many car parks across the Province and the mess that that  creates. That absolutely needs to be addressed, but, at the same time, we need  to ensure that businesses are able to advertise and use leaflets, albeit with  restrictions. The use of leaflets at car parks could be a restriction that is put  in place. We need to ensure that we are not overzealous in looking to restrict  that practice.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The same could be said about shopping trolleys. In many  cases, people take shopping trolleys off supermarket premises, wheel them up  the road and abandon them. During my time at university, it was common practice  for many students to wheel shopping trolleys into the halls of residence or  leave them outside the door. It is important that &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  That is students for you.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>:  Absolutely. Now that I am not a student, I can speak from the moral high  ground. It is important that the supermarkets do not have to pay unnecessarily  for the irresponsible actions of individuals and that those who carry out such  actions pay for them.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.45 am</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister spoke about dog fouling and nuisance dogs. I  welcome the fact that we will make restrictions by ensuring that dogs are kept  on a lead in certain areas, for example. We need to examine in more detail the  practicalities of restricting how many dogs can be walked at one time. We need  to look at how easy it would be to enforce that sort of regulation and, indeed,  at whether that would be a practical step. There are also issues to do with  noise, with many people and their neighbours living in misery because of car  alarms, house alarms, loud parties and so on. Again, it is difficult for  councils to stamp down on such matters. Any measures that can be included in  the Bill to help councils to deal with those issues are to be welcomed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Chairperson mentioned gating orders, which have been  very successful. In many built-up areas, including some in my constituency,  alleyways are a magnet to young people and those who want to engage in  antisocial behaviour or to drink, create graffiti, fly-tip and dump and so  forth. Successful steps have been taken elsewhere in the country to address  that. Alleyways are also used as an easy getaway in incidents of low-level  crime. Therefore, it would be useful to make it easier for councils to have  gating orders.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill contains a lot of positive aspects and an awful  lot of measures. There is a lot of work for the Committee to do, and I look  forward to that. I support the principles of the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I hope that the Member feels better for having got his student  misdemeanours off his chest.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  Perhaps I should also declare an interest, given that I enjoyed races in  trolleys when I was at university.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am incredibly keen on the Bill. It covers all the issues  about which those of us who have been councillors and Members are constantly  harried by the public. A hell of a lot &mdash; I am not allowed to say that &mdash; a lot  of support needs to be given to a great deal of what is in the Bill. The Bill  has been long awaited, and I think that Members will find that all councils are  very nearly ecstatic that they will, at last, have controls and powers to deal  with many of the matters that we are discussing today.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Earlier in the week, I said that there are sometimes too  many rules. However, we need a great deal of regulation in this area. We also  need action. As has been touched on, that action comes from our leadership in  government, community groups and from every member of the public. We need to  deal with matters quickly and within a time limit. Indeed, that theme will run  through some of what I say today. One thing that we are really asking for is  courage. We are asking people to be really bothered to tackle what is in the  Bill. Councils need to be brave enough to get out there to deal with matters  quickly. We need to get tough, and everyone, including the public, needs to  help.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Part 1 of the Bill deals with gating orders. I fully  support the measures on that. I look forward to councils being able to close  the areas in which youths gather, litter is thrown on the ground, substances  are used and noise occurs. People and their neighbours are cursed by what goes  on around and about them. On the news yesterday, we saw that a car park has  been closed in Comber to give some peace to those who live near it. However, I  must make the point that gating orders will not resolve the problems with  youths. We need more police on the ground and more action. We also need parents  to know where their children are, and they need to get involved. All those  points are tied in together, but I welcome the Bill&rsquo;s measures on gating  orders.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Part 2 deals with vehicles. I also very much welcome the  provisions on that matter. When I first started knocking on doors in areas that  I had not been in before, I was horrified by some of the vehicles, including  caravans, that were sitting in people&rsquo;s driveways. Those vehicles were often  sitting halfway out of driveways, with plants crawling up the sides, and there  were rats and whatever else. Councils had no ability to deal with such  situations, but I hope that the Bill will now allow us to do so. I welcome the  fact that people will not be able to sell loads of vehicles outside their house  and that councils will be able to serve fixed penalty notices.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee needs to discuss whether a fixed penalty of  &pound;100 is enough and whether there should be a broad spectrum that we can work  within. We probably need to think about linking the issue to the scrappage  scheme in England,  which is a good way of getting rid of vehicles. That would lead to more room  for parking, neighbours getting on better with one another and, at the same  time, the whole neighbourhood being cleaned up. I have a concern, though: we  must ensure that people do not remove antique or classic cars without knowing  what they are doing. Such vehicles have a high value.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Litter is dealt with in Part 3 of the Bill. It is the  scourge of Northern Ireland.  This country is the most beautiful part of the United Kingdom and one of the worst  for litter. We need to tackle that problem, and I praise the Minister and the  Department for many of the measures in the Bill. Councils will now be able to  serve fixed penalty notices and litter-clearing notices. At times, I think that  a litter-clearing notice should be served on the whole of south Antrim to allow  us to deal with the issue in one go. It is good that we will able to impose a  charge for all the work that has to be done to deal with litter.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Plastic bags are another concern, and I look forward to  seeing a private Member&rsquo;s Bill on plastic bags. Perhaps if we ensured that  every plastic bag carried a company name, we would know which company to go to  with the bags that we clear up.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Most Members can think of many areas in their constituency  that have litter problems. I find the litter problem in South Antrim, one of  the gateways to Northern    Ireland, appallingly embarrassing. On the  drive in from the International   Airport, people often see  rubbish all the way down the main road. That is just one example, and I am sure  that Members have many others. I want strong time limits to apply to how long  councils have to take action and how long people who have been served notices  have to respond and get things done. By setting tight time limits, we will  ensure that things get done.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the control on the distribution of free  literature, and I look forward to seeing it come into effect. At any big event  nowadays, there is always someone advertising something. I am also aware that  politicians are sometimes slightly to blame when it comes to putting up  election posters. We must get better at removing our posters and notices at the  end of the specified time period.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Along with all those penalties and all that work comes the  need for councils to take action, and with that comes cost. The councils must  take comfort in the fact that they can get some of that money back and will  save money in the long term. The Committee needs to think hard about how it can  help councils to deal with issues such as chewing gum and litter on the road. I  go back to a point that I have often raised in the Chamber, which is that  councils need to know who owns every bit of land so that they can tackle  littering. Often, councils cannot trace the owners of land in which rubbish is  dumped. I look forward to seeing the Bill give the council the power to go  straight onto such land to remove rubbish. If the owner cannot be found, a time  limit should be set, and the council should be able to go in and remove the  rubbish after that period. As I said earlier, councils need to be brave.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The most frustrating thing about graffiti is the length of  time that it takes to deal with it. Councils should be able to deal with racist  or personal graffiti the day after it appears. It should be possible to use  this legislation to turn the situation around so that graffiti can be dealt  with quickly and the cost of removing it recovered. Too often in my patch, if  people go to the Northern Ireland Office to complain about graffiti, they are  told that it is not the Northern Ireland Office that they should contact; yet,  when they go to the council, they are told that it is not the council that they  should contact. We have to find a way to deal with the issue, and the Bill  opens the door to a means of tackling it head-on.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am not sure where the issue of advertising at roundabouts  would sit in the Bill. Is it litter or graffiti? We need to think about that in  Committee. There is a massive amount of illegal advertising. Again, if people  drive around roundabouts in Northern    Ireland, they will see illegal  advertisements and vehicles parked on the roadside advertising people&rsquo;s wares.  We need to regulate that much more, and the Bill offers an opening to do so.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I very much welcome not only the measures to control noise  from car alarms, music and the neighbour who throws parties too often but the  fact that councils will be able to issue fines and that licensed premises may  face increased fines of up to &pound;500. Although the Bill focuses on noise at  night, we must think also of shift workers who come home during the day. Excess  noise does not occur only at night; it occurs during the day, simply as a  result of people being bad neighbours. We need to learn how to be good  neighbours to one another.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Part 7 of the Bill covers nuisance. If we use the nuisance  provisions carefully, they will help us to deal with matters at Nutts Corner.  Clause 60(1)(i) specifies noise that is:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;prejudicial to health or a nuisance;&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">and Clause 60(1)(j) specifies:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;noise that is prejudicial to health or a nuisance and  is emitted from or caused by a vehicle, machinery or equipment&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">However, it goes on to say &ldquo;in a street&rdquo;.I would  like to open up that provision to include rural as well as urban environments.  The Committee will have to consider how to deal with that. Maybe it should  suggest an amendment to add that there should be no noise from vehicles until  planning permission has been granted.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As a dog lover, I very much welcome more control over dogs  and the fact that councils will be able to issue fixed penalty notices. Again,  I ask councils to be brave. They must tackle matters relating to dogs, whether  those concern fouling or noise. In one case, my council debated for about half  an hour whether it should spend &pound;800 to take someone to court to get &pound;75. I  praise the Bill in that it allows councils to issue fixed penalty fines, but  councils need to be brave and to tackle the issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I very much welcome the proposed increase to the fine for  major pollution from &pound;30,000 to &pound;50,000. I am pleased that the Minister  mentioned at the beginning of the debate that the legislation will be reviewed  as time goes on and that maybe we should raise the top level of fines for those  who really pollute not only the land but rivers.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome almost everything in the Bill. I raise a few  other matters that should be discussed, such as gardens. When one is  canvassing, one sees some gardens that are almost health hazards. There may not  be caravans or abandoned cars in them, but there must be a way in which we can  deal with them. The High Hedges Bill touches on the issue, but it is also a  matter for this Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We need every member of the public to get involved. As I  have said already, I congratulate the Minister and his Department, and I look  forward to supporting the Bill in Committee.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I welcome the Bill that the  Minister has introduced. Having moved to the Environment Committee only  recently, I wish to thank its members for their deliberations and, especially,  the Committee Clerk for her support in bringing me up to speed with the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill gives the potential to clean up areas and to make  safer, cleaner and &mdash; we hope &mdash; less noisy environments. I am sure that Members  who have dealt with dog noise, statutory nuisances, graffiti and fly-posting  or, on occasion, antisocial behaviour will know how extremely frustrating that  can be, importantly, for the residents concerned but not least for the  officials who have to deal with the councils&rsquo; environmental health services  and, potentially, operational services and the police or some other agency, as  they try to pick up all the pieces and determine where the responsibility  actually lies. In that regard the Bill is welcome.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 1 deals with gating orders, and that rings a loud  bell with me, as I dealt with one such issue that adversely affected local  residents. Some children&rsquo;s organisations have raised concerns about the  potential adverse impact on children&rsquo;s movements, and that is an issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">However, the test of reasonableness will always be  drawn in when a council takes reasonable action to address nuisance that is  being suffered late into the night and early morning. Such nuisance is often,  although not exclusively, caused by younger people as they engage in certain  activities, which involve more than the shopping trolleys that were mentioned  earlier. The more heavy-duty goings-on include drug and alcohol abuse, underage  drinking, general bad manners and causing nuisance to people. Therefore, I  welcome that proposal.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">12.00 noon</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A little concern emanated from local government about the  liability for the total cost of the proposal and whether the money will come  from fines. The Department said that the intention is for those proposals to be  cost neutral. However, their outworkings would depend on a council&rsquo;s area. When  it comes to whether the outworkings will be cost neutral in areas of  high-intensity antisocial behaviour, the proof of the pudding will be in the  eating.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The new offence of parking more than one vehicle for sale  on a road is clearly aimed at people who try to make a living from selling  vehicles. Planning implications probably apply to those who run a business from  home, but that is an aside. I am intrigued by the potential ability of councils  to issue fixed penalty notices for vehicles that have been abandoned in public  places and to remove and destroy them immediately when deemed necessary. I have  been involved in a number of such cases, and I am sure that other Members share  my experience.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The big question is to whom the fixed penalty should be  issued. Often, when a council tries to identify the owner of a vehicle, which  is probably a runaround, its ownership cannot be determined. After a while, the  paper trail seems to go dead, even when the matter is pursued with the police.  I am not sure whether that is an issue for DVA, which is within the  Department&rsquo;s remit, the police, or both. As I know from personal experience,  when the person to whom the fixed penalty should be issued cannot without great  difficulty be identified, a great deal of bother and expense could be incurred  in disposing of a vehicle.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the fact that the Bill makes it an offence to  throw away litter. Again, the power to charge owners of abandoned shopping  trolleys for their removal, storage and disposal begs the question of  ownership. I have not seen many trolleys, which had been disposed of, that were  labelled with the name of the company to which they belonged. Usually, the  larger multinational stores, whose names are printed on their trolleys, employ  people on site to look after them and to ensure that they do not travel too  far. Therefore, I am intrigued by that proposal. At present, any discussion of  its outworkings is probably more academic than practical.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill will introduce powers to enable councils to serve  defacement removal notices on owners of properties that have been defaced by  graffiti or fly-posters and to recover the cost from people who are responsible  for those properties that have been cleaned. A major and persistent issue is  that fly-posting and defacement are often carried out without the approval of  the building&rsquo;s owner. Often, quite the opposite is true.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At one level, people should be held liable for what happens  on their property. However, Mr Kinahan referred to racist and other types of  graffiti, much of which is motivated by spite. It would be extremely perverse  if, as a consequence of the legislation, people could be held liable for the  removal of graffiti that was designed to be deliberately antagonistic towards  them. They could even be penalised for not removing it. That is one aspect that  immediately springs to mind as I read through the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the part of the Bill that deals with the control  of dogs. We had a nasty incident concerning the control of dogs outside Cookstown  a fortnight ago. Anything that could lead to additional control over dogs is to  be welcomed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I certainly welcome the part of the legislation that deals  with noise. The noise associated with alarms going off is a big issue. Mr  Kinahan rightly said that a vehicle alarm is one of the worst things to go off  during the day or night. The noise sends those in residential areas bananas.  The owner of the vehicle might not be about or the vehicle might be a runabout  that has been dumped. If it is a dumped runabout, it is hoped that the alarm would  have been neutralised by that stage, but that is another matter. It is  important that more work is done on the practical outworkings of how to deal  with vehicle alarms going off. There are alarm notification areas and  keyholders can provide councils with contact details for their properties, but  dealing with vehicles can be a wee bit more problematic. I am not sure what  sort of thought has gone into that. Such noise can prove to be one of the most  difficult issues in an estate or an area of high density.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, I would like some expansion and more detail  on those points, and I am sure that the Minister, true to form, will provide  that in his response. I welcome the Bill as a good piece of work to take  forward and to try to address those problems in our society. It will make our  environment a healthier, cleaner and more welcoming place. Go raibh maith agat,  a LeasCheann Comhairle.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  declare an interest as a member of North Down Borough Council. This may well be  an occasion on which it is an advantage for someone to have a mandate in a  council and the Assembly, because he or she will have viewed the issue at both  ends and will understand the points of view of regional government and local  government.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  Does the Member accept that the dual mandate is not what is important in that  regard, but individuals having gained experience as public representatives at  local government level at some stage?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  am grateful for that intervention, but I am cautious of incurring the wrath of the  Deputy Speaker by moving too far off the topic. To respond briefly, benefit can  be gained from separate experience or from an overlap; it can work both ways.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I join other Members in welcoming the legislation. Rather  than going through the Bill clause by clause, given that we are talking about  its general principles, I will make broader comments about how it sits and  works. There is a reflection and understanding in the philosophy behind the  Bill that the issues do not sit in neat silos for particular Departments at a  central level or for local government in isolation. There is also a sense that  when we are dealing with quality of life issues at a local level, we are not  talking simply about policing matters and the responsibility of the police and  the criminal justice system. We are talking about something broader, which  involves tackling antisocial behaviour and anti-neighbourhood behaviour in  which, regrettably, some people may wish to engage.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is an understanding that councils are, perhaps, the  most effective bodies and level at which those powers can be best exercised.  Rather than taking a top-down approach, we are talking about a bottom-up  approach and about people making the decisions and enforcing the law with a  clear understanding of their local areas. That said, there has to be  partnership and collaboration between councils and other bodies. Although I pay  tribute to the sheer volume of legislation that is coming forward, from the  Department of the Environment in particular, I stress again that this issue  will sit well in a community planning framework, when it eventually comes  forward as part of RPA or whatever we end up doing. However, I do not want to  go off on that particular tangent.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to make a point about the resource implications. I  take it from the Minister that it is expected that the income from penalties  may cover the costs that will be incurred by councils. That may be the case,  and if it is, we will welcome it. However, it is important to recognise the  fact that that assumption is entirely speculative and that it may not work that  way in practice. Broadly speaking, there is a danger in being sucked into a  notion that we expect any new policy initiative to cut its cloth and raise  revenue through enforcement or other methods. That would be welcome, but we  need to be realistic in our expectations.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Earlier, Mr Ross made a point about fixed penalty notices  that were being considered by the Department of Justice. My understanding is  that the primary objective of those fixed penalties is to speed up disposals  and free up bureaucracy. The income generation from that is welcome, but, in  the criminal justice system as a whole, the notion that the cost of the system  would ever be entirely covered through fines and recovery costs is a bit far-fetched,  to put it mildly. It is important that we recognise the fact that, sometimes,  there can be wider public policy objectives as a result of doing the right  thing, which will have to be borne from general expenditure. We should take our  decision based on that expectation. Ultimately, that is how it should be, and  whatever can be raised from fines should be seen as a bonus to the system. The  costs borne in delivering many of the desired outcomes can, at times, be  considerable. The income may not be that much, and, as Mr McGlone suggested, it  may vary from area to area.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I make that point because an underlying tension could arise  between central government and local government over the issue. Local  government will welcome the additional powers because there is a desire among  council officers and councillors to respond better to their constituents&rsquo;  problems. However, there is a sense that they are going to be lumped with the  additional costs of doing that. That points to a wider level of suspicion  between central government and local government, which, perhaps, we should not  have. If there are additional costs, it does not matter whether, ultimately,  those costs are to be borne by taxpayers through the tax system or by  ratepayers through rates. One way or another, an increased level of household  income will go to government. The expectation is that, in return, people will  get a better level of service.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That kind of tension is not particular to Northern Ireland.  It exists across these islands, and it is almost as if there is buck-passing or  finger-pointing between central and local government about who is more  efficient in delivering services. In the current climate of budgetary cuts, the  danger of that tension emerging is quite strong. We see that already in the  wider debate, with expectations from the coalition Government that local  government will control costs, and there is talk of capping rates and freezing  council tax in the UK.  Indeed, locally, the Minister of the Environment has spoken about the potential  for councils capping rates. Some councils point out that they manage their  resources efficiently; some are more efficient than central Government would  be, and I would like to think that my council, North Down Borough Council,  would be one of those. There is a danger that more responsibilities will be  passed on to councils. If the councils end up with the increased costs and,  consequently, the rates go up, all of a sudden central government will point  the finger at the councils for inappropriate management of resources rather  than the cost of central government increasing.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I make a plea to the Minister to focus on this as a  collaborative exercise between central and local government, and avoid the  temptation for it to end up as a further area where confrontation between the  two sectors can emerge. Ultimately, we are all acting as public servants in the  public interest.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will comment briefly on the issue of alley-gating and the  alley-gaters. Obviously, what we are doing is tackling the symptoms of  problems, but we need to be conscious that that is all we are doing when  antisocial behaviour occurs. Sometimes there is no choice for government but to  intervene with measures that simply try to manage situations that have emerged.  I would make a similar point in relation to ASBOs, for example. They are only  one option as part of a wider menu of options for dealing with problems.  Ultimately there has to be a focus on dealing with the causes of problems  emerging in particular areas that lead to suggestions of alley gates being  erected as a way of containing the problem. We need to look beyond what can  happen through the Department of the Environment to other aspects of government  in relation to how we can better deal with the causes of antisocial behaviour in  the first place.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also want to make a point about something that is not in  the legislation &mdash; my colleague Mr McCarthy is particularly keen that we stress  this point. When we are talking about clean neighbourhoods in Northern Ireland,  we cannot avoid the issue of the use or misuse of flags and we cannot avoid  talking about bonfires. I fully appreciate that those types of issues have  traditionally been viewed as good relations issues or cultural issues. Perhaps  we will see them discussed in more detail through the forthcoming cohesion,  sharing and integration (CSI) strategy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is also worth stressing that there are also  environmental issues; we cannot run away from that fact. In relation to  bonfires, why do we consider the dumping of wood &mdash; and potentially other, more  dangerous and sometimes lethal substances &mdash; at a particular time of the year as  a cultural phenomenon, but, at another time of the year, as littering? That is  something to be considered through the legislation. Similarly, we are happy for  the Bill to deal with fly-posting and the antisocial aspects of the misuse of  posters, but people also take a view about how flags impact on their  neighbourhoods and how that affects their quality of life.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I fully appreciate that I am delving into extremely complex  issues, particularly in a divided society such as Northern Ireland. We will have to  have some agreed way forward on how we manage the different cultural demands  that we have as a society. I fully respect people&rsquo;s right to celebrate their  culture. I think that we also need to have some agreed understanding of what is  meant by shared space in this society. Again, I make the point that shared  space need not mean neutral, sanitised space. There can be circumstances in which  people wish to put up flags or bunting to celebrate their culture; the issue is  how we manage, respect and acknowledge the fact that space is shared and is for  all the community.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There will be different dynamics in different communities.  There may well be quite strong, overt support for flags and bonfires in some  areas, but there are other areas where residents have objections to what is  happening. We need to acknowledge and manage those particular tensions. Indeed,  there can be circumstances where people do not feel secure in expressing their  real opinion about what is happening in their areas.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Givan</strong>:  Does the Member not realise that, although he claims to want to deal with it,  raising that issue at this time of year, when it does not even relate to the  Bill, actually heightens tensions? Members on this side of the House  proactively engage with local communities to try to manage the issue in a  positive manner, but his efforts today to politicise the issue only makes the  matter worse.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  hesitate to say that I am grateful to the Member for making that intervention,  because I am certainly not making an attempt to politicise the matter today. If  anything, I am trying to make my comments in very measured tones.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I work with groups in my area on those difficult issues,  and I have been doing so in quite some depth over the past number of months.  The timing of the Bill is the timing of the Bill, and certain points have to be  made about it. We are not discussing only the principles of Bill but its wider  context and the areas that could be considered to be part of the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to reiterate, particularly for Mr Givan&rsquo;s benefit,  that I am acknowledging that those issues cannot be looked at solely from an  environmental point of view and through a Bill such as this one and that wider  good relations and cultural dimensions must be taken into consideration, even  though we have traditionally viewed those issues through other prisms. When  discussing the Bill, it is important that we do not run away from acknowledging  that there are environmental considerations and that the Department of the  Environment, the Department for Regional Development, through Roads Service,  and the Department for Social Development, through the Housing Executive, are fully  aware of them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clearly, there are sensitivities around the issue. However,  we, as a society, do ourselves no favours by simply running away from  discussing difficult issues. Yet, we stand to gain from being capable of  discussing them in a mature manner. That is what I am attempting to do today.  It is worth MLAs&rsquo; recognising that constituents will wish to raise their  concerns about the issue with them over the coming summer months. I certainly  hope that this summer is a peaceful and constructive one. We, as an Assembly,  must grapple with the wider policy issues. I had better leave my comments  there. I look forward to seeing how the Bill proceeds through its various  stages.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Givan</strong>: I  welcome the Bill, which is wide-ranging. It would be wrong to lose sight of the  extent to which it will help to provide clean neighbourhoods. Some people may  think that the Bill is about only litter, but it actually covers a wide range  of issues and will go a long way towards ensuring that councils have the tools  and powers that they need to improve the quality of the environment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A lot of us get annoyed when we see people dropping rubbish  in a park, local village, street or on the beach. When I take my daughter, who  will be three in August, out for a walk, and she sees a piece of rubbish, she  points to it and says, &ldquo;Daddy, daddy. Rubbish.&rdquo; She usually follows that up by  saying, &ldquo;Naughty boy&rdquo;, because she seems to think that only naughty boys drop  rubbish. If she, at her age, can recognise that rubbish should not be dropped on  the ground &mdash; she usually wants to pick up the rubbish and put it in the bin &mdash;  why can young people and adults not recognise that they should not drop litter  and that it costs the taxpayer a huge amount of money and councils a huge  amount of effort to it clean up?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I challenged some young people about why they drop rubbish,  and they made the idiotic comment that it keeps somebody in a job, which is  absolute nonsense. Such individuals would continue to be in a job but councils  could use them in a much better fashion. Therefore, the issue of litter is an  important one.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the provision on fixed penalties. People who  cannot be taught that dropping rubbish is wrong should be punished and should  be given an appropriate fine to discourage them from doing so again. The Bill  will increase the powers that councils have, but it is up to them to then use  those powers effectively. Stephen Farry talked about there being tension  because central government is passing the buck. I am sorry that the Member  thinks that central government is in the best position to try to deliver that  function, because it is not, the councils are. Therefore, there is no  buck-passing exercise.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member talks about not wanting to create tension.  However, by his comments, rather than recognising the good work that the  Minister has been doing, he is creating suspicion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  am not sure whether the Member is a member of local government, but I think  that he is. Therefore, he should be aware, from his discussions with  councillors, that the powers are welcome. However, at the same time, there is  nervousness in local government about the cost implications and the potential  for powers to be introduced without resources being made available. The point  that I was making was that, ultimately, the function should be delivered  through local government. Whether it is all paid for through rates or through  taxation does not matter that much, because the money would still be coming out  of the same households. Issues arise over the management of the tension that  may emerge, so it is important that, if local government costs go up as a  result, central government does not point the finger and accuse local  government of increasing rates and being inefficient, particularly at a time  when cuts are putting cost pressures on government across the board.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Givan</strong>:  The end result must be a cleaner environment, and councils are best placed to  deliver that. It is for councils to manage how they carry out their functions,  and the Bill indicates that those will be cost-neutral. I do not know how North  Down Borough Council manages its finances, but Lisburn City Council, of which I  am a member, manages its finances very well, which is why its rates are the  second lowest of any council in Northern    Ireland. Therefore, I am quite sure that our  council will be able to take on this function and deliver an efficient and  effective service to the ratepayers of Lisburn.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I particularly welcome the proposal to introduce gating  orders. In my constituency, there are alleyways in which a huge amount of  antisocial behaviour, which causes concern for businesses and nearby  homeowners, takes place. Clause 1 will enable councils to deal with antisocial  behaviour effectively. It will help not only the local community but the  police, who, when contacted by the local community about antisocial behaviour,  come out but are unable to catch people because the alleyways are used as  escape routes. Therefore, gating orders will also help the police to catch the  people involved.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also welcome the controls that are being suggested to  limit the distribution of free literature. I particularly welcome the  exemptions for charities and religious organisations. Some Church organisations  raised the issue, and I am pleased that there will be exemptions for those organisations  to distribute their literature.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill is wide-ranging in its measures and is one that  the Minister, when he came into post, was determined to put through the House.  His officials have done an excellent job in producing the Bill, and, once the  powers are in place and begin to be implemented by local councils, people will  see tangible benefits. I support the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  I declare an interest as a member of Dungannon and South Tyrone Borough  Council. Perhaps I should also say that it was the only council that did not  increase its rates last year. If Members want to know how that is done, they  can come up to Dungannon, and we will show them. However, that is not really  relevant to today&rsquo;s debate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is not often that the House sits on a Wednesday.  However, if it is sitting for no other reason than to take the Bill to its next  stage, it will have been worthwhile and time well spent. However, we are  debating a matter of such magnitude that I express some disappointment at  Members&rsquo; attendance. Many of us serve on local councils and, therefore, have  first-hand knowledge of the litter problem. Litter is something that grieves us  all. A considerable portion of the rates bill is spent on gathering and  cleaning up litter that has been deposited by those who sometimes do not give  much thought to dropping it.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">12.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I warmly congratulate the Minister, his Department and  officials for getting the Bill into the House and bringing it to this stage. If  it does pass &mdash; having listened to Members&rsquo; comments, I suspect that it will  pass unanimously &mdash; Northern    Ireland will be a different place as a  result.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, there are one or two matters on which I would like  the Minister to comment in his winding-up speech. There are issues in the Bill  that need a little bit more clarification, and I would like to hear his views  on those. I have concern about the implementation and enforcement of the  legislation. It is all very well to have a Bill and to tell people what they  should and should not do; it is quite another thing to get them to do it, as is  what the aftermath will be if they do not do it. There is, therefore, the issue  of enforcement.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At present, we have powers to issue what are called ASBOs &mdash;  anti-social behaviour orders. In the past year, 39 ASBOs were applied for and  granted. As everyone in the House will be aware, the agencies that can apply  for an ASBO are, of course, the PSNI, the Housing Executive, and local  councils. In the police division in which I reside, which takes in Cookstown,  Dungannon, Fermanagh and Omagh, not a single ASBO was issued. I cannot believe  for a moment that no antisocial behaviour goes on in those areas. As one who  lives in Dungannon, I have to say, unfortunately, that there is.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That, of course, takes us to the field of litter louts.  People going into any town or street in Northern Ireland will find litter in  one form or another, whether cigarette butts, or chewing gum, which has been  much referred to in the debate. There is no more obnoxious piece of litter  being deposited on our streets than chewing gum. It is the scourge of all  council areas. It is not an easy one to tackle and is not one that can be dealt  with at low cost. Therefore, I wonder whether the proposed legislation will be  effective, sturdy and robust enough to deal with an issue such as that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A number of Members mentioned dog fouling. That issue has  to be tackled in a big way, because it is becoming a real problem, certainly in  the Dungannon area. I hope that the Bill will enable it to be dealt with  effectively. Although dog fouling is an offence, I do not read in my papers or  get reports from my council that another one, two, three, four or five people  have been dealt with in relation to dog fouling.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I warmly congratulate the Minister for taking the Bill to  this Stage. As I said, if implemented and enforced, the legislation will change  the face of this country. However, I have concerns about the enforcement. I ask  the Minister whether there are any incentives in the Bill, because a carrot can  sometimes be as constructive as a stick?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I declared that I am a member of Dungannon and South Tyrone  Borough Council. In the past, we have entered competitions such as Ulster in Bloom and Britain in Bloom. We have done  exceptionally well, and if Members want to come up they will see why. To see  all those things that are happening there is another reason why tourists should  be coming to Dungannon. However, that is for another day and, perhaps, another  place.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If the Bill is light on anything, it is light on  incentives. Councils may wish to go into new aspects of tackling litter,  antisocial behaviour and all the things that relate to that. What incentives  will the Minister&rsquo;s Department give them to ensure that that happens? When my  council enters competitions, the town is spick and span. There are those who  visit the town to see it, and I am sure that you, Mr Deputy Speaker, have come  to Dungannon just to see it on many an occasion. In the run-up to the competition,  there is not so much as a leaf on the ground. Once the competition is over,  there is a tendency to slip back a little and allow a leaf to fall before it is  picked up.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We want a Bill that encourages activity all year round from  the local community. Can community groups avail themselves of any provision in  the Bill that provides an incentive for them to express an interest in their  town, village, street, neighbourhood or housing development? When we get it  right down to that level, we will make a big impression. Not only should  councils be involved, but every one of us has a part to play. There is a big  onus on us to do that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is potential for lines to get a bit blurred around  the role of the Environment Agency in all of this. I have been critical of the  NIEA in private and in public; it does not react quickly enough sometimes, and,  when I speak to them, it tells me that it does not have the resources. There is  a gap between the responsibilities of the council and those of the NIEA in  dealing with a form of litter, be it lorry-loads of rubble or whatever it is.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In my town, we had a situation recently whereby a local  farmer became a victim of some lout who deposited material on his land, yet the  farmer was held responsible and he had to go through a very costly exercise of  cleaning the whole thing up. Not only that, he was taken to court through no  fault of his own. We all have to be responsible for our properties and for what  is on them or not on them. However, sometimes there is an unfairness that has to  be looked at too. I know the individual involved; he is a highly responsible  citizen of Dungannon, and I think he was dealt a very hard blow.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The area that this Bill can make most impression in is by  encouraging something that, in Northern    Ireland, has in the main been lost: civic  pride. If we can get back to the day when everyone, all the citizens of Northern Ireland,  take a keener interest in the towns, villages, streets and housing developments  in which they live, that will be a big achievement. This Bill can go some way  in doing that. I look to the Minister to see whether, in the future, he can  inject some incentives for community groups and councils.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We recognise that society is strapped for cash at present;  there is an economic downturn and there may be worse news ahead. In such times,  these things get secondary treatment, and I do not think that that should be  the case. It is imperative that this sort of stuff that the Minister is trying  to get through here today should be given top priority, and it is a pity that  there are not more MLAs in the House to take part in the debate. We all have a  part to play here. This is not an issue where the Minister comes through with a  Bill and tells the councils to get on with the job. That is a part of it; but  there is much, much more to it. There is an education programme here, and that  has to be taken seriously.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My colleague referred to a stroll in the park with his  young daughter. We could all draw the parallel. It is dreadful to follow a car  and see litter being deposited from each window. I had that unfortunate  experience quite recently, when a Mars bar wrapper was thrown from one window  of a car in front of me, and a Bounty bar wrapper came out of the other side.  Those folk must have been having a picnic in the car. I do not know what was  going on.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Dungannon park is another very scenic area and another  reason why MLAs should visit Dungannon. I once saw a person deposit an empty  can there, and I told him that I thought that he had dropped something. He  replied that he did not think that he had It is that sort of unthinking  behaviour that brings big bills to our local council areas, as well as bringing  shame. There will be costs around the implementation and enforcement of the  Bill. How does the Minister see those costs being met? Will councils have to  take on extra resources or will it be done with existing resources?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Your attempted promotion of Dungannon was commendable.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>: I  declare an interest as a member of Carrickfergus Borough Council. The Bill will  increase the enforcement powers of councils over a wide range of areas.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill is long overdue. This Assembly has been sitting  for over three years and, in welcoming the Bill, I have to say that it is  regrettable that it did not come at an earlier stage. England and Wales have had the Clean  Neighbourhoods and Environment Act since 2005, and I am aware from my  constituency work of how this Bill could enhance the lives of many of our  citizens.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The additional powers that will be introduced by the Bill  must be welcomed by all. They will significantly update Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  legislative position. The Bill will give district councils additional powers to  address litter, nuisance alleys, graffiti, illegal fly-posting and abandoned  and nuisance vehicles. It will also improve legislation governing dogs, noise  and statutory nuisance issues. Such issues are not effectively covered by the  existing provisions in Northern Ireland,  but they are being addressed by local authorities in England  and Wales  through different legislation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The powers in the Bill are to be welcomed as a means of  addressing local environmental issues. The lives of many of our citizens will  be enhanced when councils and other statutory agencies use enforcement powers  against the misdemeanours that are taking place, such as fly-tipping. I am  thinking of the dams and reservoir around Carrickfergus, the Woodburn and the  Lough Mourne dams, where fly-tipping has occurred on a number of occasions.  Anything that increases the powers of our agencies and councils to ensure that  the environment is kept in pristine condition must be supported.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill will also make it very clear who will be  responsible. There has been wrangling over whether NI Water, the Forest Service  or the councils are responsible. There will be an obligation to sort that out  at a much earlier stage and improve the environment, because, of course,  rubbish collects rubbish, and the sooner that it is tidied up, the better.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A key aspect of the Bill is that it allows for fixed penalty  notices for a range of offences and the retention of those fixed penalty  receipts by councils, which may make some contribution to the cost associated  with the additional work that will come with the legislation. A wide range of  additional areas will come under the remit of local authorities, which they  will be able to pursue in order to improve the lives of citizens. However, at  the same time, it will allow council officers to act in a manner that will be  much more speedy and that will require considerably less resources than other  forms of legislation; for instance, taking ASBOs to court level. Some of the  new provisions for dealing with noise in the street, car and house alarms will  result in councils having to carry out additional work, but they will also  enhance local neighbourhoods and our citizens&rsquo; lives.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">12.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister indicated previously that planning powers  would have been devolved to the 11 super-councils. He subsequently indicated a  wish for planning powers to be devolved to the current 26 councils. In  addition, it was indicated that Housing Executive powers would be progressively  passed to local councils. It would be helpful of the Minister to clarify that  whole area to provide an understanding of the context in which the new laws will  operate in terms of any complementary budgets that may or may not be coming to  local councils.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I turn to the proposed gating orders. In my constituency  work, I have come across situations in which these would be a useful tool to  improve the lives of local residents. Concern was raised relatively recently  about some of the access points to Greenisland railway station &mdash; I am thinking  in terms of antisocial behaviour and underage drinking. Outside railway  operating hours, when there are no trains, gating will be a useful option to  consider as a way to improve the lives of pensioners who are being plagued at  present &mdash; that is, if other measures prove unsuccessful.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am also aware of locations where considerable antisocial  behaviour has occurred in the past, including dumping in the middle of housing  areas. In one area, families had to be rehoused after it reached the stage of a  couple of arson attacks. As some Members have said, there are areas in which  drug dealing goes on. A key aspect in my mind was that there were multiple  escape routes in that area. Anybody wanting to get up to antisocial behaviour  had numerous means of getting away from the law or others who might have been  trying to apprehend them for their criminal actions. I view the gating orders as  useful.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for the Environment</strong>: Does the Member recognise that the  other element to gating orders is that parts of some developments are used as  walkways? Does he accept that, if we are to introduce alley-gating, proper  consultation with all the people in an area is needed?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  Consultation will be a key aspect of alley-gating that restricts movement. I  suspect that councils will not proceed with gating without clear support from  local people. I am thinking of areas that service the back entries to houses  and to back gardens, which would be used by a small number of residents living  in that area.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The entry that I am thinking of was attracting people from  outside the area; it was not a route to or from anywhere, it was merely a  service area for those houses. I understand the point made by the Member: if  there was a right-of-way issue, there might be difficulties in closing it down.  However, if it could be seen to be of service only to local residents, I would  fully support their wish to take back ownership of that area. They would have  keys to enter as freely as they wish, but the movements of those from outside  the area would be restricted. As I said, in some areas I have seen dumping  occurring, fires being started and drug dealing going on. Anything that would  return such an area to local ownership must be supported unambiguously &mdash; I  would support local residents in their wish to improve their area. I have also  said that the Northern Ireland Housing Executive had an alley-gating budget:  will that be passed to councils?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I turn now to Part 2 of the Bill, which refers to vehicles  and nuisance parking offences. I intend to concentrate on this area, because my  constituency work has given me some experience here. Some Members may think  that the number of clauses dealing with that area make the Bill over-elaborate  and burdensome, but I welcome those details. My sense is that those details  come from experience, and if the Assembly is to enhance any of the powers in  the Bill, we have to take account of what people say. In my experience, those  who have been involved in nuisance parking, and so forth, look for every  available loophole to abuse the system, which results in antisocial behaviour  that greatly disturbs ordinary neighbours.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I warmly welcome the Bill, which environmental health  officers suggest will enhance their ability to improve local environments. At  present, they work closely with the Housing Executive and the police to deal  with antisocial behaviour. I can think of an individual from my constituency  who caused misery to his neighbours in the Taylors Avenue area of Carrickfergus by  collecting and dismantling abandoned vehicles. In court, the police linked that  individual with 90 vehicles that had been abandoned on a small number of  streets over several years, causing huge disruption, leaving the area looking  unsightly and making it difficult for residents to park. Indeed, one disabled  resident was unable to park close to his home.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In that case, although an ASBO was issued, existing  legislation clearly did not work. The matter rolled on for six or seven years,  involving numerous agencies and, in the past two to three years, a number of  statutory agencies met monthly to discuss it and other issues. Dealing with  such cases using ASBO legislation involves considerable cost. As a public  representative, I gave evidence in court because people were fearful and  suspected that houses had been damaged in relation to the case. Abandoned  vehicles can also be used as runarounds for petty, or even more serious, crime,  so removing them from our streets can play an important part in preventing  further crime.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My ASBO experience required numerous court sittings; I have  to admit to a level of frustration with the court system. An interim ASBO was issued,  followed by the actual ASBO case. There was then an appeal, but the individual  involved dismissed his legal representation, so we had to come back for a  second appeal. As we scrutinise the Bill, we should bear in mind that, using  the present system, the cost of dealing with abandoned vehicles is horrendous.  In the court case that I attended, the following were also present: eight  police officers and two environmental health officers; and the prosecution  counsel and a defence barrister and solicitor, who were paid for by legal aid.  There were also the usual court costs. When all the costs are added up, I  reckon that the whole case cost a minimum of &pound;10,000 or perhaps even &pound;20,000.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The new legislation must be welcomed, because issuing a  fixed penalty notice at an early stage will allow situations to be dealt with  more speedily and efficiently. Instead of having to spend years gathering  information, during which time residents may be tortured, the Bill will provide  a speedier and more efficient method with which to address the issue, so I  welcome it. I hope that no other residents have to undergo the experience that  those on Taylors Avenue  had to face. I might add that the situation has improved considerably since the  ASBO was issued.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I said, some Members may consider the powers to dispose  of vehicles to be too detailed and over the top. For instance, people will be  prevented from selling vehicles on a public road. When too many vehicles for  sale or repair are parked on a public road, they cause road safety issues and  prevent other people from parking their vehicles. If a business regularly works  on cars on the public road, it causes problems for neighbours. It also gives  rise to road safety issues: how can appropriate health and safety checks be  carried out, and how can the public be protected from all the tools, and so on,  that are left lying around? However, it is important to strike a balance so  that the legislation does not apply to people who work on their own cars  outside their homes.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I told Members about my experience of dealing with the  power to require names and addresses. The activity in question happened at  night, which made the situation more difficult, and the vehicles concerned were  registered in multiple names. Some people were not even aware that vehicles had  been registered in their names. Anything that increases the statutory powers to  gather information must be welcomed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill contains more detail about the notice of and  procedures for the removal of such vehicles. My experience was that, on a  number of occasions, when it became known that the statutory authorities were  about to lift a car, it was deliberately set on fire in the middle of a  residential area. Therefore, there are good reasons for increasing the  councils&rsquo; powers to enable them to lift vehicles speedily and, if necessary,  dispose of them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Storage costs are involved when cars are taken to a  compound. We do not want to incur unnecessary costs, particularly for vehicles  that are at the end of their life. It is appropriate that their speedy disposal  should be possible after attempts have been made to contact the rightful owner.  In the past, some individuals attempted to use the complex existing legislation  to claim compensation for their vehicles. They did so by making themselves  difficult to contact and then trying to claim compensation after their vehicle  had been lifted. As there is a clear need for improvement in that area, I see  good reason for the detail in the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic" align="center" style="text-align:center;">(Mr Deputy  Speaker [Mr Molloy] in the Chair)</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the increased powers for litter control, the  additional protection for the waterways from littering and the use of fixed  penalty notices in early and efficient enforcement. Our waterways were almost  omitted from the Bill, because it was unclear who controlled or owned them,  and, therefore, it was not clear how action could be taken.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Litter clearing notices will facilitate the enhance&shy;ment of  neighbourhoods. As I said, rubbish collects rubbish, and, therefore, litter  problems must be addressed as early as possible. I accept that difficulties  arise when someone illegally drops material on private property. In practice,  who will tidy up that material, other than the owner? If the quantities of  litter are excessive, statutory intervention is required. At present, however,  it is largely down to the owner to clear the material. The legislation makes  that clearer at a much earlier stage.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have all had advertising flyers placed on our  windscreens. Frequently, they blow away and litter an area. The legislation  needs to be improved. I welcome the provision that requires businesses to take  greater care to prevent their shopping trolleys from going astray. Members  would be surprised by the costs that businesses incur from trolleys going  astray. They will, therefore, benefit from having to manage their trolleys more  carefully. Over the years, numerous trolleys have turned up in the Inver river  in Larne. They endanger wildlife, and the local angling club has undertaken a  number of clean-up operations to clear trolleys and other debris from the  river.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">1.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill also covers graffiti and other defacements. It is  important to improve the regulations so that our town centres are not defaced  by fly-posting and graffiti and that there are more speedy routes to tidy that  up. Fly-posting is an interesting area. We do not want to be hitting the owners  of the walls that have been posted on; many of them have not have indicated  their willingness for the fly-posting, and I suspect that most of the pasting  takes place in the dark. Who benefits from the posting? That is an area that we  may well have to look at. Frequently, the leaflets do not say who printed or  published them. However, if they are advertising a particular event, it is  clear who will benefit from that event. If those who do the illegal fly-posting  cannot be traced, them some degree of accountability should be brought home on  those who promote or benefit from the event, as they will have paid for the  posters to be printed and erected. Therefore, we must introduce accountability  and look at the enforcement powers that are there so that responsibility does  not fall on the homeowner or the owner of the business where the items have  been pasted.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I agree that we need new regulations restricting the sale  of aerosols to children. Why do children need aerosol cans? If there is a  particular art exercise for school work, I am sure that their parents will be  more than willing to purchase the cans and let their children use them  appropriately in their own home. We do not want our town centres disfigured and  full of graffiti. We need to improve our environment and make it more  attractive to visitors and tourists. This is an increasingly important area.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are also powers to make dog control orders, and we  will need to look into the detail of that. Most people in local government  agree that there are problems with dog fouling and how dogs are regulated. We  must ensure that there is improvement there, and we must also ensure that  responsible owners are not unduly burdened. We need to check that the balance  is there.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Intruder alarms are set off frequently and can run for  hours and hours. Therefore, I welcome the increased scrutiny in that area and  the fact that local government will have a role in ensuring that businesses  control their intruder alarms. Many people live in residential accommodation in  town centres, and we must remember that people are going back to living over  the shop. Therefore, it is important that we not allow their home life to be  disrupted by faulty alarms.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If enacted appropriately, the regulations will generally  improve the quality of life for our citizens. I welcome the extensive use of  the fixed penalty notice throughout a whole range of areas. It will allow for a  speedy and efficient method of bringing about improvement and address things  earlier at a lower level, which will enable that speedy improvement to come  about. The Bill can help to empower local people. With the support of local  councils and other agencies, it will be possible to enhance the lives of many.  Generally, I support the Bill and look forward to discussing it in more detail  in Committee.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B Wilson</strong>:  I declare an interest as a member of North Down Borough Council.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Like other Members, I welcome the Bill as it addresses many  of the problems that face councillors on a day-to-day basis. It will increase  the powers of councillors and bring them into line with district councils in Great Britain.  The additional powers introduced in the Bill are overdue and significantly  update the existing legislative position. It will give district councils powers  to address problems that are not covered by currently legislation but that can  be addressed by local councils in GB. In recent years, I grew increasingly  frustrated because the council did not have adequate powers to resolve many of  the problems that my constituents raised. The new powers provide a means of  resolving existing problems, and I have no doubt that they will assist in  improving the quality of life and health of many residents.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">To many, issues such as abandoned vehicles, litter,  graffiti, fly-posting, dog controls and noise may not seem particularly  important. However, they can cause considerable distress and have a significant  impact on many residents&rsquo; quality of life. For example, an abandoned vehicle  often causes concern for neighbours. At present, a council officer must put a  notice on the vehicle but cannot move it for a week. During that time, it  attracts vandals who wreck it or set it on fire, and that causes considerable  distress to local residents. The new proposals give the council the power to  issue fixed penalty notices for the offence of abandoning a vehicle and the  power to move the vehicle. Therefore, it does not have to sit there annoying  the residents. The Bill is welcome because it streamlines the process for  dealing with abandoned vehicles. However, north Down has a major problem with  abandoned caravans that is not addressed under current legislation, and I am  not sure whether the Bill addresses that. It should be extended to deal with  caravans.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As many Members said, litter is a major problem that raises  much public anger. In fact, it costs ratepayers in north Down almost &pound;1 million  a year. As a society, we are a filthy lot, particularly compared with our  continental neighbours. The present legislation is not effective in dealing  with that problem, and the council needs greater powers. I hope that the powers  in the Bill will resolve that matter. Therefore, I welcome the Bill&rsquo;s proposal  to make it an offence for a person to give a false name and address when they  are questioned by an authorised officer about a litter offence. In addition, in  light of the courts&rsquo; failure to deal adequately with litter louts, it is more  appropriate for such an offence to be punishable by a fixed penalty notice. I  welcome the introduction of the fixed penalty notice in the legislation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the litter clearing notices, which can be served  on an occupier or owner of land. Those are long overdue, because many serious  neighbourhood disputes have arisen because householders allow rubbish to  accumulate in their gardens and the council cannot do anything to resolve that  problem. I hope that those notices, which require land to be cleared of litter  within a specified time frame, will reduce that problem. However, I believe  that the 28-day compliance period may be too long. That should be reconsidered.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill contains provisions on fly-posting. However, I am  concerned that the Bill provides powers to councils to target only the people  who post the information as opposed to the beneficiaries. The power to target  the beneficiaries lies with the Planning Service. Although it is more effective  to target those groups, the Planning Service in Northern Ireland does not see that  as a high priority. If fly-posting is to be properly addressed, councils must  have full powers of prosecution.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although the Green Party welcomes the new proposals to  create dog control orders and the measures to resolve noise problems, we are  concerned that they will create an additional workload for councils and,  perhaps, be a strain on their resources. I cannot accept the Department&rsquo;s view  that the financial effects of the Bill on local councils will be cost neutral.  Although the proposals are welcome, it is unlikely that they will lead to full  cost recovery by councils through the income generated by fixed penalty  notices. The time spent by officers and on administration that is required to  investigate and enforce many of those issues adequately will still be  significant and, therefore, will still carry a cost to the council. The  Department should reconsider the proposed levels of fine and consider whether  they adequately reflect the polluter pays principle.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill allows for fixed penalty notices for a range of  offences and the retention of fixed penalty fines by councils, but that will  not meet the costs associated with the additional work. Furthermore, the  successful resolution of many such problems is often best achieved without  recourse to formal action. We will not need to go to the courts. If we have the  power of the courts behind us, situations can be resolved in an informal  manner. Such an approach will not attract fees and, hence, income. Moneys  obtained from the provisions are likely to be relatively small compared with  the level of work associated with such complaints. Notwithstanding those  comments, the use of fixed penalties, with the amount set by councils, and the  retention of fees for use in qualifying functions is welcome.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In view of those matters, I ask the Department to consider  what additional resources could be made available to councils to successfully  undertake the new and enhanced powers and, therefore, improve environmental  conditions in our area.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We welcome the introduction of the Bill and the increased  powers that it gives to the tackling of environmental crime. The new powers  will provide a new foundation to change antisocial behaviour, which impacts  directly on the quality of individuals&rsquo; lives, health and standards of living.  The legislation introduces excellent opportunities to begin tackling a broader  range of local environment quality issues, and I hope that we can develop those  at Committee Stage. I support the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: I welcome the general support for the Bill that Members  have expressed. Mr Boylan, on behalf of the Committee, indicated the  Committee&rsquo;s broad support for the issues that were raised and asked questions  about helping local communities. Much of what we are doing through the Bill is  enabling local authorities to make local areas and neighbourhoods better and  cleaner places. The Bill will largely be implemented through local authorities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A number of Members, including Lord Morrow and Mr McGlone,  raised the issue of the cost of implementing the Bill&rsquo;s provisions. Our advice  is that it should be close to cost neutral. There may well be an expense &mdash; that  remains to be seen &mdash; but it will not be hugely expensive. Most people who own  their own homes know that it may cost a bit of money and hard work to make  their place look better. There may be a small cost and additional work for  local government, but the benefit, reward and incentive will come in their  sense of place and the civic pride that Lord Morrow referred to. They will have  a considerably better community for the small cost associated with the  implementation of the Bill. Indeed, it will lead to considerably less cost  because there will be less waste to be collected.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I would like local authorities to work with others. It is  up to each local authority to decide how to do it, but I look at the  effectiveness of the officers who implement car parking restrictions in our  towns and cities. Is there any reason why those officers are not brought in to  assist in observing people who drop litter and ensuring that they are brought  to book? There are six or eight such officers in full-time operation in the  city in which I live. Why bring in additional officers if those who are already  there can be employed for a small sum?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">People ask how it will work, but it will work by doing it.  I know of local councils that employed litter officers in the past. Lisburn  City Council employed a litter officer, perhaps 20 years ago, and I think that,  after about 12 weeks, one person was done for dropping litter.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The news needs to be that somebody &mdash; perhaps more than one  person &mdash; was done on Monday, somebody was done on Tuesday and somebody was done  on Wednesday. I guarantee that, once the local community gets the message that  people are regularly receiving on-the-spot fines for spitting out chewing gum,  dropping litter and despoiling our streets, we will see an improvement in  behaviour within weeks or months. People do not want to get caught and have to  pay a fine. They do not want anyone to look at them and say, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s yer man  from our estate. He was one of the ones who got caught.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">1.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I guarantee that that approach would make a difference, and  quickly. Effective early implementation of the measures would drive home the  message that such behaviour is no longer tolerable. The public should not have  to put their hands in their pockets to pull out not litter but pound notes to  pay for others who drop litter out of their pockets rather than put it in a bin  or take it home with them. We need to be very strong on the issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Boylan mentioned cars on footpaths, and that is a matter  for the Department for Regional Development (DRD) alone. He also mentioned  alley-gating, which is a problem. DRD addressed the issue in Belfast, and the scheme that was put in place  there has been of considerable help.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A number of Members, including Mr Beggs, who talked at  length, talked about problems associated with certain areas. Graffiti, drugs  being sold and young people with plastic bags for glue-sniffing are all common  sights in those areas. The ability to clamp down on those activities is very  limited at present. The system for putting alley gates in place is so  convoluted and cumbersome that it is not effective. The Bill will allow us to  deal effectively with issues through the local authorities and in a way in  which the community wants us to. A community may want an alley to stay open  until 7.00 pm or 8.00 pm in the winter or until 10.00 pm in the summer. I do  not know, for that is a decision for the community to make in conjunction with  its local authority. However, the community should get what the community  wants. If the community does not want an alley gate, it should not have one. If  the community wants one, let it work out with the local authority at what times  the individual who is given the keys to the gate should lock it each and every  day. People will get used to alley gates, and they will welcome them. They will  assist policing, particularly in clamping down on low-level crime.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Ross told us about what students get up to, and then Mr  Kinahan elaborated on that when he confessed that he had engaged in  shopping-trolley racing. We see people walk out of supermarkets with trolleys  full of drink. It costs them &pound;1 to wheel a trolley full of drink back to their  destination, but those trolleys are inevitably not returned. Those people do  not care about getting their pound back, and the trolley ends up being dumped.  As I cycled to work last week by the River Lagan &mdash; I recommend that all Members  try that, as it will help to keep them all looking fit and well, particularly  over the summer &mdash; I saw shopping trolleys in the water. That is completely  wrong, and such a sight spoils an area of natural beauty.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Supermarkets need to get the message that they must think  about what they are doing to secure the investment that they have made.  Supermarkets have spent a considerable amount on buying the trolleys, so could  they not chip them to prevent them from being taken beyond a certain area? What  is happening at the moment is theft. If I were to walk out of a supermarket  with &pound;100 of goods that I have not paid for, I suspect that the security guard  would stop me fairly quickly. However, I can walk out of a supermarket with a  shopping trolley, which I expect is worth &pound;100 or more, and take it away with  me. Many people are doing that with impunity. Why can shopping trolleys not be  chipped so that an alarm goes off when people try to take them away? Security  guards could then deal with the problem there and then. That would tackle two  problems at once. That area needs to be addressed. Hopefully, this legislation  will create an impetus for the supermarkets to act. Not only will they lose the  shopping trolleys, they will be charged for their removal from the waterways or  wherever they are dumped. Perhaps the message will then get through to them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Kinahan also mentioned rural noise. I would express  caution to the Committee on that point. Some very fine people move into rural  areas, and they are not there for very long before they start to complain about  the smell of slurry and about farmers who are ploughing until midnight, making  silage, mowing grass, cutting barley and so forth. They fail to understand  that, on occasion, country people have limited time frames in which to carry  out their work. Although some people might want to lie in bed at 6.00 am,  others want to get on with their work. I do not want to introduce some sort of  legislation to benefit people who have moved from towns to rural areas and who  just do not understand that, although there are many positive aspects to living  in a rural area, there are also some negatives. I caution the Committee against  going down the route that Mr Kinahan suggested.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  I am interested in the Minister&rsquo;s point about farmers who want to get on with  their work at 6.00 am, and I understand that. However, will he take it from me  that some urban dwellers start work at 6.00 am, and some start even before  then?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  the Environment</strong>: Absolutely. Nothing should be taken out of what I said  that implies otherwise. Many urban dwellers are very hard-working people. It is  just that some urban dwellers who move to rural areas have a little difficulty  in coming to terms with how things are done.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Kinahan also mentioned cost recovery, as did Dr Farry.  Dr Farry said that recovered costs are just a bonus. I do not see it that way  at all. It is something that my colleague Mr Ford, the Minister of Justice,  will need to address. The amounts that can be recovered were set down in an  Order in 1981. A council can recover only &pound;75 for something that might cost it  &pound;500, &pound;1,000 or more. That figure might not have been unreasonable in 1981, but  now, 30 years later, it might be appropriate to revisit it. I do not see why  we, the ratepayers, should pay huge amounts to ensure that things are done  right. I encourage my colleague Mr Ford to address that in due course. I am  aware that he has a very heavy workload. Members only have to listen to the  radio to hear mention of the Department of Justice every morning in relation to  other issues. I am, therefore, aware that he has considerable work to do, but I  will support him if he addresses that matter.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McGlone referred to the cost-neutral issue, which I have  sought to deal with. I recognise that there is an issue about abandoned  vehicles. At present, the Driver and Vehicle Agency database has some difficulties  in identifying all abandoned vehicles. Considerable work has been done on that,  and Statutory Off Road Notification (SORN) declarations have helped to ensure  that many more vehicles are easily identifiable. I should add that many scrap  vehicles have value. People make businesses out of collecting and processing  them for further use. Therefore, the proposed actions can be taken at a fairly  low cost to local government. Councils can set up arrangements with legitimate  companies that engage in processing scrap metal for further use, and I think  that that can be done reasonably, without putting a huge burden of cost on the  ratepayers. At the same time, the Driver and Vehicle Agency (DVA) will continue  to try to deal with the identification issue that was mentioned.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McGlone also raised the issue of alarms. Car alarms can  be dealt with under the new statutory nuisance measures in Part 7 of the Bill,  which makes provision for:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;noise that is prejudicial to health or a nuisance and  is emitted from or caused by a vehicle, machinery or equipment in a street&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">District councils must issue abatement notices when they  are satisfied that a statutory nuisance exists, may occur or may recur. In the  case of car alarms, a notice is served on the responsible person, or on the  vehicle if that person cannot be found. If the abatement notice is not complied  with, the district council is empowered to enter or open a vehicle &mdash; by force,  if necessary &mdash; to silence a car alarm and to remove the vehicle from the street  to a secure place if that is necessary to abate the nuisance. Therefore, powers  to deal with that issue are relatively extensive.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Farry raised the issue of buck-passing between councils  and central government. The Bill is not about buck-passing. Responsibilities for  clean neighbourhoods already exist within local government. As it stands,  almost all of the issues that we are debating are local government  responsibilities. What we are doing is creating the opportunity for local  government to deal with them much more efficiently and effectively. It is  enabling legislation for local government, not a method of passing councils  further responsibilities that will cost them more money.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Farry also mentioned flags and bonfires. Let me say  this: flags and bonfires do have an environmental impact. However, Northern Ireland  is somewhat peculiar. That peculiarity is demonstrated by the fact that there  is no Opposition in this place at this time. Because of those peculiarities and  difficulties, flags and bonfires will not be dealt with as part of the normal  environmental process. They are a matter of community relations, which is  headed up by the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister. In Northern Ireland,  there are many challenges in dealing with problems that have existed in the  Province for generations. They will not be dealt with through this particular  Bill. Therefore, although I appreciate the Member&rsquo;s comments, they will not be  dealt with under this particular legislation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Givan mentioned exemptions that relate to literature  that can be given out. I can assure him that literature that is associated with  church organisations will not be affected. Mr Morrow referred to implementation  and enforcement. It is important that councils who have requested this legislation  and who desire it wholeheartedly take it, endorse it and carry out its  implementation. Early and quick implementation will mean more cost-effective  implementation. Any cost that could potentially be associated with  implementation will actually be retrieved quickly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Morrow also referred to incentives. A council&rsquo;s  incentive is to have a quality neighbourhood and environment in its area. He  also indicated that Dungannon and South Tyrone Borough Council did not raise  its rates in 2010. I commend it for that. Other councils seem to have imposed  hefty rate rises, not all of which were necessary. Having just resigned from a  council, I am glad to say that the council that I left is in good condition. It  has the second-lowest rates in Northern    Ireland and, I believe, the seventh-lowest  debt per head of the population, and it has excellent services. It demonstrates  that quality services can be provided without always having a high rate base. I  encourage councils to look at how they can do their jobs better in that  respect.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Beggs commenced with a whinge about the Bill&rsquo;s timing. I  could not have brought it forward any sooner. I am happy to bring the  legislation forward; I think that it is the right legislation. Mr Beggs also  mentioned fly-tipping. The Bill does not deal with illegal waste activities,  such as fly-tipping. That will be dealt with under the Waste and Contaminated Land (Amendment) Bill. Illegal waste  activities involving illegal dumping of waste, or fly-tipping, can have a  detrimental impact on the local amenity. One of the main objectives of the  Waste and Contaminated   Land (Amendment) Bill is  to ensure that Departments and councils have sufficient statutory powers to  deal effectively with illegal waste activity. It is intended to give councils  the same powers as the Department to prosecute offenders.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">1.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We also recognise that legislative change alone will not  provide a solution to illegal waste activity, so we are working with local  government to develop a fly-tipping protocol, which will clearly set out the  respective roles and responsibilities of the Department and councils in dealing  with illegal fly-tipping activities. I sympathise often with councils and  private landowners who find that people have dumped goods on their property and  they are left with the responsibility. I know that people have dumped on other  people&rsquo;s property highly toxic materials that have been used for laundering  diesel, and the property owner has been left with the clean-up costs. That is  wrong, and it is something that we in government need to address.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In other instances, councils have had to collect dead  animals from rivers, and that is wrong. We need to look at how we can address  those issues and seek to challenge them. Let us be honest: it is wrong that  individuals carry out such dumping in the first instance. Traditionally, a lot  of people in Northern    Ireland have turned a blind eye to a lot of  those activities, but, in fact, the individuals who are engaging in such  activities are destroying the neighbourhood for everyone. We need to encourage  the public to move away from taking a blind-eye approach to activities that we  know are going on in our neighbourhoods. Such activities are damaging to our  neighbourhoods and our country, and it costs all of us. Let us rise to the  challenge.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Morrow referred to the individuals who dropped the  Bounty bar and Mars bar wrappers. They are fairly low-level offences, but I  encourage people to take the registration numbers of cars from which rubbish is  thrown, report the individuals and allow the councils to follow it up. Unless  we do that and provide the information, we cannot expect to reap the dividends.  Let us rise to the challenge of those who contaminate our neighbourhoods and  despoil and destroy our country, and let us, the good people, take them on and  tell them that we are not going to tolerate their activities any more and that  we are going to report offences. That will not make us touts or bad people.  Doing so will ensure that we are keeping a better, cleaner and healthier  Northern Ireland and a place to which tourists will be attracted to visit and  others will be attracted to invest and live in.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That the Second Stage of the Clean Neighbourhoods and  Environment Bill [NIA 31/09] be agreed.</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading"><a name="d"></a>Housing (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Second Stage</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development (Mr Attwood)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That the Second Stage of the Housing (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill  [NIA 32/09] be agreed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It might be helpful if, in the first instance, I give some  background to this legislation because, as the House and, certainly, the  Committee, will be aware, in December 2009, my predecessor Margaret Ritchie  published proposals for new housing legislation to support the delivery of the  private rented sector strategy and to make new provision in respect of  homelessness, fuel poverty and community safety. I will comment on a number of  those matters during my speech.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department received more than 40 responses, which were  broadly supportive of most of the proposals. Time constraints mean that it is  not possible at this time to take forward all the proposals outlined in the  consultation paper. It is only fair to the House that I explain why that is the  case. It is due to the demands on the parliamentary draftsman, which were made  more acute by the fact that there were six separate pieces of legislation  relating to the possible local government reorganisation. In view of the  urgency around that matter and given the potential for reorganisation by 2011  and the short time frame between then and now, the parliamentary draftsman was  overloaded. Consequently, other legislation would not have had the full due  diligence of the parliamentary draftsman in ensuring that the legislation  coming before the House was all that it should be. Consequently, opportunities  to include other matters in the Bill were frustrated because of the time  available to the parliamentary draftsman&rsquo;s office.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Nevertheless, I acknowledge the work of the parliamentary  draftsman. Executive approval had been given to the Bill only at the end of  April 2010. The Department and the parliamentary draftsman have done good work  to ensure that we have legislation before the House at Second Stage. The turnaround  time, from the end of April to the introduction of the Bill in the middle of  June, was very short.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I said, the Department received 40 responses to the  consultation. The Bill has been drafted on the basis of the consultation,  focusing on key areas where there is a particular need for early action. The  Bill will help to support the housing agenda by enabling better regulation of  the private rented sector, providing new tools to tackle fuel poverty,  promoting effective housing management and clarifying existing laws. I want to  touch on some of those matters.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The main focus of the Bill is on improving the management  of the private rented sector, which has grown significantly in recent years and  now represents almost one fifth of the total housing stock in Northern Ireland.  Building Sound Foundations, the Department&rsquo;s strategy for the private rented  sector, was launched in March 2010 and set out a range of proposals to improve  regulation of the sector and provide increased protection for tenants. The Bill  addresses some of the strategy&rsquo;s core recommendations and will enable my  Department to make subordinate legislation to create schemes for the mandatory  registration of landlords and the safeguarding of deposits paid by tenants.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill will improve the effectiveness of existing  measures for regulating the private rented sector by amending the Private  Tenancies (Northern Ireland)  Order 2006. That Order introduced two measures into law and into practice in  the North. The first ensured that properties in the private rented sector are  fit for human habitation, and the second required landlords to provide proper  documentation about the management of their tenancies, such as a rent book. The  Bill builds on those provisions and protections and, therefore, enables us to  go somewhat further.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  The Minister makes an interesting point about the Private Tenancies Order 2006.  Although it improved existing legislation, many council environmental health  officers felt that it did not go far enough. It did not give them the teeth to  deal with some of the more serious problems in the private rented sector,  including HMOs.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I concur with the Member. The Bill addresses the  councils&rsquo; contention that they did not have the teeth to deal with various  matters. For example, there is a responsibility under the 2006 Order to ensure  that properties are fit for human habitation. However, the ability of councils  to pursue the issue of whether properties are fit for human habitation was  frustrated by the fact that there was no mandatory registration scheme for  private landlords. Such a scheme creates a better opportunity for councils to  do their business. The Bill will ensure that, once mandatory registration of  private landlords is established, that information can be shared with local  councils. In turn, local councils can go about the business of ensuring that  fitness standards are fulfilled. Therefore, I agree completely with what the  Member said. The Bill gives councils the evidence base from which they can do  what they were meant to do under the unfitness provisions and ensures that the  private tenant is better protected.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The second area that the Bill deals with is houses in  multiple occupation. The Bill improves protections for houses in multiple  occupation by ensuring that the current system of regulating such accommodation  operates effectively. Quite properly, the Housing (Amendment) Act 2010 amended  the definition of the term &ldquo;family&rdquo; for the purpose of identifying houses in  multiple occupation to ensure that accommodation occupied by members of a  single extended family is not subject to the regulatory regime. The Bill will  place an obligation on the landlord, owner or operator of a house in multiple  occupation to provide documentary evidence of such a family relationship where  it is being used to seek exemption from HMO regulation. Failure to provide  satisfactory evidence would mean that the property would be subject to  regulation as a house in multiple occupation. There are instances across Members&rsquo;  constituencies &mdash; this is certainly the case in the constituency that Mr McCann  and I represent &mdash; where the issue of multiple occupancy has arisen. In so far  as the DSD responsibility is concerned, the Bill will create a mechanism to  regulate that better.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is clear that that measure alone will not address the  issue of multiple occupancy and, in particular, the change in character of  areas where more and more properties go into multiple occupancy. However,  without anticipating what may or may not develop, I hope that, in the near  future, another ministerial colleague of mine may be in a position to begin to  address that issue and the experience of places in West   Belfast and many other constituencies.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The third element of the Bill relates to community safety.  The Bill will improve the sharing between landlords of information about  antisocial behaviour and will allow the Housing Executive and registered  housing associations to withhold consent to an exchange of tenancies where an  applicant has been guilty of such behaviour. The proposals are in response to  issues that the Committee for Social Development and social housing landlords  raised. I know that the matter preoccupied the Committee, and I may comment on  it further in my winding-up speech.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>:  Does the Minister still think that there is a possibility that people who are  removed from Housing Executive housing could be housed in hostels? Will he let  us know whether that will cover hostels, as well as other sectors?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank the Member for his intervention. I will respond  to that matter in my winding-up speech, because I wish to scope out a number of  matters on antisocial activity in the housing sector and how we may manage that  in the future. A lot of those issues have some equality consequences, and I  want to make sure that we measure our response appropriately in any future  addressing of antisocial activity across the public sector and the private  sector. Therefore, I will deal with that particular matter in my response.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A small measure in the Bill deals with homeless&shy;ness. The  Bill will also improve the operation of the homelessness legislation by  bringing the Housing Executive&rsquo;s statutory duty to an end in cases where a  person ceases to be eligible for assistance. That is a technical change that  will affect a small number of people, and it is designed to ensure that  homelessness legislation recognises the reality of situations where the Housing  Executive cannot legally provide accommodation. Given the common concern that  parties and Members have about homelessness, I stress that that technical  change will affect a small number of people. I enquired about that this  morning, and my information is that, currently and in any one year, that change  will affect no more and perhaps somewhat fewer than 10 people and that, in the  context of changes arising from transitional provisions with European  enlargement over a number of years, that figure will actually come down to even  fewer than 10 people.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The fourth element of the Bill deals with fuel poverty. The  Bill will allow the Housing Executive to broker energy at a discounted price.  That measure, which is recommended by the fuel poverty task force, has the  potential to alleviate fuel poverty among tenants of social housing and could  benefit other energy consumers by encouraging new entrants to the domestic  energy market in Northern    Ireland. In addition, the Bill will provide  district councils with powers to promote energy efficiency in residential  accommodation in their district. That will complement the work that is being  undertaken by my Department and the Housing Executive, which runs the Home  Energy Conservation Authority for Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">1.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to stress the importance of that issue because,  although fuel brokering is in its early days here, there have been some  dramatic examples in other jurisdictions of how that can work. Although the  scale is very different and the market is more open in America, there  have been some good examples there of how fuel brokering or the bulk purchasing  of fuel can work to help disadvantaged people in particular. Joe Kennedy and  his Citizens Energy Corporation in Boston  is an example of how interventions in fuel brokering can work to the advantage  of people in need. Although this matter is technically difficult to address, I  hope that the provision will be taken forward by the Housing Execuitve, which  has 90,000 units on its books.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">With the entry of Airtricity, there is now is an open  market in the North, and I believe that, especially at this time of further  financial stress, our Government, given the number of buildings that they have  and their energy consumption, should consider how to broker electricity costs  and maximise the advantage to the public purse.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a clear need for the Bill, which, I openly  concede, has useful provisions that are somewhat more moderate than might  otherwise have been the case had we had sufficient time to legislate more  fully. Nonetheless, the Bill will improve the lives of people in the private  rented sector and in social housing in particular. I am confident that the Bill  will be well received by key stakeholders in the public and voluntary sectors.  On that basis, I hope that all parties fully support the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>: It  has been agreed that I shall speak initially on behalf of the Chairperson of  the Committee for Social Development, who tenders his apologies. The Committee  for Social Development spends the greater part of its time considering,  scrutinising and debating housing issues. Members will, therefore, not be at  all surprised to learn that the provisions of the Housing (Amendment) (No. 2)  Bill have been reviewed in great detail by the Committee at the prelegislative  stage. Now that the Bill is at Second Stage, those provisions will continue to  be of great interest to all Committee members.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will now set out the Committee&rsquo;s views on the principles  of the Bill. I will first mention what is, unfortunately, not in the Bill. When  the Committee reviewed the relevant departmental consultations, there were a  number of proposals in which members were particularly interested. They  included increases in the notice-to-quit period for longer-term tenants in the  private rented sector; a number of antisocial behaviour measures, including  linkages between eligibility for social tenure and the behaviour of a tenant; a  requirement for private rented tenures to comply with the decent homes  standard; and the introduction of safeguards for homeless people where the  Housing Executive has secured accommodation for them in the private rented  sector. In the Minister&rsquo;s response today, I hope that he will further set out  why those proposals have not been included &mdash; he has already alluded to some of  the issues &mdash; and whether he will consider amendments to deal with some of those  excluded measures.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I now make some comments on behalf of the Committee. Some  Committee members have previously expressed concerns about variations in  statements of tenancy conditions and in the nature of rent books across the  housing sector. The Bill introduces what is intended to be some consistency in  respect of the provision of statements of tenancy terms and the content of rent  books. The Committee welcomes that and will, therefore, wish to further  consider the aspects of the Bill that apply solely to the private rented  sector.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The majority of Committee members will welcome the  introduction of the rent deposit scheme. Members have questions about the cost  and bureaucracy associated with similar schemes in other jurisdictions that we  looked at. Some Members also voiced concerns that the rent deposit scheme will  not stop wrongdoing by those who might be termed bad landlords. It is argued  that, although the measures are aimed at landlords who wrongfully withhold  deposits from tenants, it will be the good law-abiding landlords who will have  regard to the new provisions and have to manage the additional administrative  burden. Bad landlords will tend to ignore the provisions. Therefore, it will be  interesting to see what enforcement issues there are around that. The Committee  will want to be sure that there is appropriate, targeted and commensurate  enforcement to ensure compliance. That will be the secret to dealing with bad  landlords on that issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A perhaps more contentious aspect of the Bill will always  be the mandatory landlord registration system. On the one hand, some Committee  members argued that the recent growth of the private rented sector and the  large number of private tenants who are on benefits are good reasons to require  landlords to be registered. Those Members hope that registration will be the  beginning of a regulation process for the private rented sector, similar to  that which is already employed in the social housing sector. On the other hand,  as I said previously, some Committee members and stakeholders, such as the  Landlords Association, contend that registration will be an undeserved  additional burden for good landlords, while landlords involved in bad practice  &mdash; the ones with overcrowding difficulties and those who offer unfit  accommodation &mdash; will simply ignore the regulations. All Members will view with  great interest the relevant provisions of the Bill and will be keen to ensure  that the associated regulation-making powers are appropriate. I have no doubt  that some members of the Committee may have a great deal more to say on those  issues, and I look forward to hearing those comments.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee is pleased to see measures in the Bill that  are designed to curb antisocial behaviour. Anything that tries to tackle that  issue will be warmly welcomed by all Members. The Committee lobbied for better  information sharing between social landlords and for restrictions on exchanges  for tenants who inflict antisocial behaviour on their neighbourhood. The  Committee warmly welcomes the fact that that information will now be shared  between housing associations and the Northern Ireland Housing Executive.  Antisocial behaviour is always a serious issue. Many Members, myself included,  frequently have to deal with a wide range of related problems in their  constituency. Therefore, some members of the Committee would welcome further  discussions with the Department and the Minister in respect of amendments to  the Bill to further enhance antisocial behaviour measures.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill includes a change to the Housing Executive&rsquo;s  responsibility in respect of what are termed &ldquo;ineligible homeless individuals&rdquo;.  It is understood that that is merely a technical change that seeks to remove  the legal anomaly whereby the Housing Executive has a duty to certain homeless  people but, owing to other legislation, is unable to fulfil that duty. It is  understood that the migrants in question can come from the A8 countries. The  Committee received evidence from the Welcome Organisation that, in some cases,  it was forced to use its funds to help small numbers of homeless people who  were ineligible for assistance. During a departmental briefing on the  homelessness strategy, the Committee also learned that DEL and OFMDFM were to produce a policy on  those homeless and ineligible migrants. Given the potentially tragic  consequences of withdrawing support from homeless people, the Committee will  want clarification on the treatment of those homeless and ineligible migrants  in this and neighbouring jurisdictions to be sure that what is proposed is fair  and consistent.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee welcomes the clauses on energy brokering for  NIHE tenants and on the promotion of energy efficiency. The Committee spent a  great deal of time considering fuel poverty. Therefore, it is pleased by the  promotion of practical measures that exploit economies of scale by the Housing  Executive and the local knowledge of organisations, such as district councils.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I would now like to say a few words as an MLA, as opposed  to speaking on behalf of the Committee. I congratulate the Minister on moving  to improve the exchange of information between housing associations and the  Housing Executive. I have strong feelings about that. I raised the matter in  Committee and was pleased to receive its backing. I know of cases in which the  Housing Executive and, I must add, housing associations ended up getting their  fingers badly burned by some of the tenants who had been passed on to them. The  situation led to all sorts of antisocial behaviour and to tenants having to be  moved out and rehoused, but it was not always the guilty party who had to move.  However, that was down to an anomaly whereby the information that the Housing  Executive had on tenants could not be handed over to housing associations and  vice versa. It is good that the Minister is tackling that serious issue, and I  hope that his action will stop those unfortunate situations arising again.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I share the Committee&rsquo;s disappointment that some other  issues were not dealt with. The Minister explained why we are running into  timescale difficulties, and I must accept that. However, that disappointment  remains, and I hope that there may be an opportunity to deal with the outstanding  issues in future.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On behalf of the Chairperson of the Committee for Social  Development, I advise the House that, notwithstanding my earlier comments on  provisions that seem to be missing and issues that require clarification, the  Committee is generally content with the principles incorporated in the Housing  (Amendment) (No.2) Bill.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s speech. Whether Members stand here or sit round a  Committee table discussing housing, we always speak about those who are most in  need and how we can try to create better conditions for them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to comment on the passage of the Bill. I share  Jonathan&rsquo;s disappointment, as I feel that we have been let down by the  Department and by the former Minister with regard to its content.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">During the passage of the first Housing (Amendment)  Bill, Members from my party argued for a number of amendments to be made but  were convinced not to do so by departmental officials who assured the Committee  that that Bill was not the one to tamper with. They explained that a further  housing Bill was in preparation that would address many of the issues that we  had brought up.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I was disappointed to hear at the briefing last week that  much of what was promised has been removed from the Bill and that the Bill will  be categorised as an enabling Bill that will allow some of those issues to be  legislated for down the line. The excuse given is that otherwise there would  not be time for the Bill to complete its passage before the end of this  mandate. Had my party been informed of that during the passage of the previous  Bill, we would have then attempted to make some of the amendments that we had  in mind. The new Minister has inherited this situation, and we await its outcome.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Among the measures removed from the Bill is none other than  the strengthening of antisocial legislation, which is something that our  communities are crying out for. Out on the hustings in the run-up to the last  election, antisocial behaviour loomed large in people&rsquo;s minds. Having spoken to  people from all parties, I know that they came up against the same demands.  Community safety and the economy are the biggest problems for people. I spoke  to the Minister earlier in the week, and we agreed that there are serious  problems out there. Unless we get to grips with those problems, we are  achieving nothing. If we can work together, we can achieve something. We in  this Chamber have an obligation to ensure that our community is protected  against those who would destroy it from within. Contrary to the belief held by  some that antisocial behaviour is strictly a policing matter, we all need to  realise that this is a societal issue that must be tackled by us all.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am unsure whether provisions for the sharing of  information will be added through enabling legislation that will come some way  down the line or whether that matter will be effectively dealt with by the  Bill. Over the past couple of weeks, I have had occasion to speak to some  senior representatives from housing associations. They have said that, even at  this late stage, after we had brought up the issue and assurances were given in  the Committee, there is still no sharing of information across housing  associations and between them and the Housing Executive. Most of the housing  associations do not inform one another, because what they want to do is move  problems elsewhere and out of their jurisdiction. That is one of the  difficulties.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We raised the possibility of stronger legislation to deal  with those who wreck their communities through acts of vandalism. We want to  ensure that such people will be forced to pay for the damage that they cause.  We also wished to address the role of residents&rsquo; associations and look at how  they are resourced in other jurisdictions. It is common practice for housing  associations to include in their budget a community funding package which  includes the funding of local residents&rsquo; groups. I am a great believer in good,  strong residents&rsquo; associations. Properly trained and resourced, they can  provide the front line in the battle against anticommunity behaviour. The  resourcing of residents&rsquo; associations is virtually non-existent in housing  legislation in the North and, unless legislated for, will not be acted on by  housing associations. Also, gone should be the days when housing authorities  just see themselves as housing providers. They need to be community builders  and work with other statutory organisations in the community to deliver  mixed-tenure, sustainable communities and a safe place to live for all the  residents.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have also raised the issue of the common selection scheme  and the adverse impact that that allocation scheme has in areas of high demand.  I first raised that many years ago with the direct rule Ministers with  responsibility for social development. I have been continuously advised that it  will be reviewed to take on board the issues that we raised. Again, we wanted  to amend the first Bill to address that but were advised against it on the  grounds that the new Bill would deal with the issue and such consideration would  prolong the first Bill&rsquo;s passage through Committee.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The other issue that we wanted to deal with was the  question of the private rented sector. During this mandate, Sinn F&eacute;in has been  to the fore in speaking about the need for action to be taken to ensure that  the private rented sector is legislated for by way of a mandatory registration  scheme, with strong powers to ensure compliance. That suggestion was met with  strong resistance from the former Minister for Social Development and her  Department, which seemed to favour non-regulation at the time. We wanted to  table amendments on mandatory registration but were advised that this new Bill  would be the mechanism to deal with it. We have now been informed that a  committee has been set up to advise on a mandatory registration scheme and that  enabling legislation will mean that the issue can be dealt with somewhere down  the road.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">What more information does the Department need? The  consultation that it carried out showed that almost everyone who took part was  calling for mandatory registration and for strong powers to ensure compliance.  That unregulated sector, which is in receipt of more than &pound;90 million of  housing benefit, is a sector in which many operate seriously bad tenancy  practices. Those include illegal evictions; intimidation of tenants; poor  quality stock; withholding of deposits for the flimsiest of excuses;  overcharging of tenants; and ignoring antisocial tenants. The list goes on. It  is a sector that has more than doubled its stock in the past seven years and  can operate without worry about being brought to book for its practices. We  have been informed that a mandatory registration scheme will take a while  longer. We will again ask Members to support action to ensure that strong  powers on compliance and not just mandatory registration are included in the  Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department seems to suggest that a lightweight scheme  should be considered. Some time ago, landlord representatives from LANI gave  evidence to our Committee. From their comments, I believe that LANI would have  supported the mandatory registration of the sector. Many of its members provide  quality housing for the rented market and are interested in getting rid of the  bad apples. We have an obligation to ensure that tenants are protected, while protecting  landlords from bad tenants.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Management companies that offer poor service for the money  that they are paid are not included in the Bill either. Again, strong  legislation is required to ensure that homeowners are protected. My  understanding is that that sector is regulated in other jurisdictions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I attended a consultation event in February 2010 which the  Housing Rights Service and the Council for the Homeless organised. The people  who attended were representative of a wide range of opinion across Belfast and the rest of  the North. Those people called, almost to a person, for a strong mandatory  registration scheme, with strong powers on compliance. They also discussed  antisocial behaviour and recognised that that is an issue that needs to be  tackled.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Concerns were raised about people&rsquo;s rights. We all share  those concerns, but we must also ensure that those involved in the destruction  of their communities are brought to book. The Bill is not the stuff that will  bring about change and bring relief to tenants or communities; rather, it puts  much on the long finger or refuses to deal with serious issues. I hope that the  Committee and the Assembly will not allow this opportunity to pass by and will  instead use the Bill to deal with the serious issues that we seem to be  bypassing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have no doubt that all parties in the Chamber are crying  out for some type of action to be taken against antisocial activity. As I said,  that is one of the big issues. However, since I came to the Assembly, an issue  that I have pursued is the mandatory registration of the private rented sector.  That is crucial. I noticed that the Minister rightly said that there were  provisions in the Bill to deal with mandatory registration as part of enabling  legislation. However, he forgot to include what sort of compliance rules will  be brought in to ensure that landlords abide by the terms.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">You can talk to the Housing Executive about its scheme  relating to HMOs. However, in Dungannon, for example, the owners of HMOs get up  and move overnight if they are challenged, or they go to court and receive a  &pound;100 fine, only to place people back in the same conditions. We need to achieve  a meeting of minds. If issues are put back until the next mandate, it may be  another four or five years before we are able to deal with some of them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister and I share a constituency that has been  wracked by cases of antisocial activity. However, in the past couple of years,  parts of the area have been opened to the unrestricted development of HMOs.  That decision must be revisited.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Armstrong</strong>:  The Bill has four main objectives: to enable the better regulation of the  private rented sector; to provide new tools to tackle fuel poverty; to promote  effective housing management; and to clarify the existing law in respect of  homelessness. Those are all praiseworthy aims, and I am sure that, even if  there is some difference of opinion about how to achieve such goals, the  intention to tackle those problems will be supported by all sides of the House.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Official statistics indicate a growing homeless&shy;ness  problem in Northern Ireland.  The Housing Executive records the level of homelessness in Northern Ireland  in 2008-09 as more than 18,000 households. It is tragic that homelessness is a  growing problem, which may be partly due to the current economic climate.  Collectively, we must do more to tackle it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I support the proposal to move towards the registration of  landlords in the private sector. That would be good for the entire housing  sector and should help to ensure that tenants have a good standard of  accommodation, to safeguard their deposits and to encourage landlords to be  more responsible to their tenants. It would also help to protect legitimate  landlords from less honest ones, making it good for business. However, I  caution against the emergence of overly restrictive regulations that would  impact negatively on business, which is an issue that we will examine in  Committee. I am pleased that housing management has been included in the Bill  and look forward to examining those provisions in greater detail.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Constituents have come to me with their experience of  problems with other social housing tenants. Such problems can be deeply  distressing and affect them and their children daily. Our neighbourhoods must  be made more secure places where individuals and families can flourish and  where antisocial behaviour is challenged, not tolerated. I strongly believe  that rights come with responsibilities. If some tenants are not prepared to  live up to the responsibilities that come with being provided with housing and  if their behaviour towards fellow tenants and citizens is antisocial, they  should face sanctions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am particularly pleased to see that addressing fuel  poverty is more extensively provided for in the Bill. It should be noted that  there was almost unanimous support from stakeholders for the Bill&rsquo;s proposals  on fuel poverty. It has been said that one in two households here are affected  by fuel poverty. Northern Ireland  is the region with the lowest levels of income in the United Kingdom,  yet it spends more on energy than any other. That combination has been even  more devastating during the past five years with significant increases in  energy prices.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The &lsquo;People Power&rsquo; report launched this month showed that  energy brokering could reduce electricity, gas and oil prices for Northern Ireland  consumers. Energy brokering is the co-ordinated bulk purchasing of energy on  behalf of multiple users. I look forward to examining such ideas in greater  detail in Committee. The proposal to provide councils with powers to promote  domestic energy efficiency in their district has the potential to provide great  benefit to those on low incomes and at greatest risk of living in fuel poverty  by increasing their awareness of the importance of being energy-efficient.  Raising that awareness is critical in a strategic approach to tackling fuel  poverty and eradicating it in the long term.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I look forward to examining the Bill in greater detail in  Committee and to the debate that will ensue in the House.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  I welcome the Bill. Its main focus is to improve the regulation of the private  rented sector, which will, in turn, provide a means to protect tenants&rsquo;  deposits and to resolve disputes as quickly as possible. I support and welcome  the proposed regulation of the private rented sector.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My constituency experience tells me that the eradication of  fuel poverty is vital to eliminating social exclusion and to achieving a  sustainable future for all. There is a power here for the Housing Executive to broker  energy for tenants at a discounted price, and I hope that it will do that. That  is to be welcomed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill will also provide the means to combat antisocial  behaviour in communities. It will provide for increased co-operation and  information sharing on antisocial behaviour in housing allocation eligibility  decisions, homelessness exchanges and house sales. The provision for the  Housing Executive and housing associations to withhold their consent to the  exchange of tenancies on the basis of antisocial behaviour is another measure  that protects against such behaviour. All those things will go a long way  towards helping to eliminate antisocial behaviour by residents. I welcome the  Bill.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: The  Alliance Party supports the principles of the Bill, although I must add my  disappointment to that expressed by other Members over the exclusion of a  number of proposals that were consulted on. It is wrong of us to consult our  stakeholders and then turn round and not include them. I hope that the next Government  will revisit those issues quickly and that the proposals will appear in  forthcoming legislation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I warmly welcome the mandatory registration scheme, which  is long overdue. Although there are a lot of good landlords, there are also  some irresponsible ones. They receive a large proportion of housing benefits,  so it is only right that the sector be held accountable. Although some private  landlords have expressed reservations about the administrative burden, on the  whole they see the regulation of this growing sector as a step in the right  direction.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I very much welcome the introduction of rent deposit  schemes. In my South Belfast constituency, I  have dealt with cases where local and foreign students have been treated  unfairly, with unfair deductions being made from their deposit. Some of them  had to go to England  or other places to take up employment, and others had to return to their  country of origin because their visa had run out at the end of their degree  course. They could not wait to see the outcome of negotiations with landlords,  so they lost out on retrieving their deposit. Not only is that unfair, it gives  us a bad name when students go back to Malaysia,  China  or wherever saying that they have been badly treated by landlords here. I also  welcome the introduction of dispute resolution mechanisms, which are a good way  to provide arbitration for both sides and to produce a fair settlement.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In relation to antisocial behaviour, I welcome the power  for social landlords to withhold consent to the exchange of tenancies, and I  welcome the mechanisms for the better exchange of information between the  Housing Executive and social housing providers. Better communication is better  for everybody.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">With respect to the removal of the so-called legal anomaly  concerning individuals who are ineligible to be registered as homeless, I  dispute the Minister&rsquo;s assertion about it being only a very small number of  people. I deal with a number of those cases in my constituency. Very often,  Housing Executive staff tell us immediately that the migrant workers are not  eligible and they refuse to deal with them. The Minister said that there were  only 10 cases, but those were only the cases that some of the staff took into  consideration. Often, there is a flat refusal to deal with them. That results  in the Belfast Welcome Centre and the voluntary sector having to deal with a  lot of the cases. Those people are not eligible to be registered as homeless,  so the voluntary organisations do not receive any housing benefit. The people  are without recourse to public funds.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  Recently, the Minister spoke at a Belfast Welcome Centre exhibition in the  Waterfront Hall. Does the Member believe that the vast experience of the  Belfast Welcome Centre and other groups should be tapped into before any  judgement is made on how to move forward?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>:  Absolutely. So far, the burden has been on the voluntary sector, which operates  on a shoestring.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I very much welcome the Housing Executive having the power  to negotiate energy brokering schemes. We have very high fuel prices in Northern Ireland.  Economies of scale are involved, and the Housing Executive deals with many  housing units. If it can negotiate better deals for its tenants, that is a very  good measure.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>: I  support the Bill. In particular, I welcome clause 2, which will enable the  Department to make regulations providing for schemes to safeguard deposits paid  by tenants in the private rented sector. It will also place certain obligations  on landlords with regard to the scheme.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Many private tenants have, for far too long, been the  subject of abuse when trying to get their deposit back. Usually, the landlord&rsquo;s  word is gospel. The Bill will enable the Department to bring in a similar  scheme to that in England  and Wales,  which allows for an insurance-based deposit scheme that will include a dispute  resolution mechanism and a mandatory requirement for landlord participation,  with fines for failure to comply. I welcome the scheme, which will protect  tenants who are at the hands of unfair and greedy landlords looking to take  their deposits.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome clause 3, which permits entry of persons  authorised by district councils to carry out fitness for human habitation  inspections of private properties. No one should be forced to live in  properties that are not up to standard. I wholeheartedly welcome clause 5,  which enables the Department to make regulations that provide for the  registration of private landlords. That is long overdue and, along with clauses  1 to 3, will see private landlords made much more accountable. I urge the  Department to ensure that landlords &mdash; those who own the property rather than  manage it &mdash; are on the register so that they can no longer escape  accountability or responsibility, as many of them did. The name of the owner on  the deeds of the house should match the name on the register. That is very  important for the regulation of the private rented sector.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome clause 8, which places an emphasis on the  occupant, not the Housing Executive, to provide evidence of a family relationship  to avoid being listed as a house in multiple occupation. I also welcome clauses  9 and 10, which relate to the disclosure of information about anti-social  behaviour orders. Those clauses enable a landlord, with all of the information  about the tenant available, to decide whether to withhold consent in accepting  a tenant, should they hold an anti-social behaviour order. I am disappointed  that all the other elements of the Bill that deal with antisocial behaviour  matters have been withdrawn. I hope that the Minister will bring those back at  a later stage. The clause also helps to make a decision on whether the tenant  has a right to buy the property in the disclosure of information.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I especially welcome clauses 12 and 13. Clause 12 enables  the Housing Executive to submit for departmental approval a scheme for making  arrangements with energy providers for the supply of electricity, gas or oil to  Housing Executive tenants. Tenants would receive discounted prices, which would  make sense, given the fact that the Housing Executive has a large stock of  homes and it would be within its power to negotiate a bulk discount, thereby  saving tenants money.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 13 provides district councils with powers to promote  energy efficiencies in residential accommodation in their district. Money would  also be saved through the efficient use of energy; for example, through the  proper insulation of homes. I welcome the Bill and support its Second Stage.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank Members for their contributions. Specific  matters were raised, and I will try to deal with all of them, although I will  have to come back to some Members on certain issues.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I have said in respect of other legislation that I have  been responsible for since I became Minister for Social Development, I do not  look at any piece of legislation with a closed mind. Therefore, in responding  to the debate, I may indicate areas in which I would welcome amendments. There  may be other areas where, even if I do not see the need for amendments, I might  encourage them. Although we have a small window of opportunity, nonetheless we  should use that window as far as possible. That is the mindset that I bring to  this legislation, as I do to other legislation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am not impressed by Members who refer to being let down  by the Department and let down by the previous Minister.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I will give way in a second. There is a collective  sense of being let down over the course of this mandate. I do not intend to  detain Members or rehearse what transpired over the course of this mandate in  respect of the blockages that arose in the Office of the First Minister and  deputy First Minister, the fact that there was a suspension of the Executive for  150 days or the fact that a lot of policy initiatives have been bogged down in  one way or another. Therefore, when it comes to feeling let down by a  Department or a Minister, Members should face up to their wider  responsibilities and the individual and collective failures that have brought  about a situation in which we are faced with the consequences of legislation  being bogged down and faced with the need to try to legislate quickly. We are  also faced with a situation in which the parliamentary draftsman&rsquo;s office is  already overburdened. Legislation has been pending in respect of the RPA that  has come to nought, creating further blockages for the parliamentary  draftsman&rsquo;s office. I share that feeling of being let down, and I do not think  that there is any Member in the Chamber who does not share it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic" align="center" style="text-align:center;">(Mr Deputy  Speaker [Mr McClarty] in the Chair)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  That is all well and good. However, last year, we talked about new legislation  for the private rented sector, which was to come into effect in March this  year, and there was to be follow-on legislation. Therefore, there was no delay  in respect of that. I am talking about issues that I have raised here over the  past number of years, whether it was dealing with antisocial behaviour or the  private rented sector. During a debate on the Housing (Amendment) Bill, I said  that I wanted to propose amendments. However, I was encouraged to delay those  amendments until this Bill was introduced. The issues that I raised and wanted  included in this Bill are being delayed again. The Minister cannot say that I  should not be annoyed or surprised. Of course I am annoyed and surprised; I  thought that those important issues were ones that we should deal with,  regardless of how long it takes us.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I appreciate what the Member says, but the last piece  of legislation was drafted and was passed by the Assembly in the political  context of that time.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the interim, this legislature has not worked as  effectively as it should have, and the Executive have not worked as effectively  as they should have. In the run-up to the Hillsborough negotiations, no party  in the Chamber, including the Member&rsquo;s party, denied that devolution had not  lived up to the ambitions and hopes of people in Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If the Member wants a proper discussion about why  legislation is not as fully fledged as might have been anticipated a couple of  years ago, he should look at the context of the intervening two years and at  the upsets, doubts, delays and difficulties that held up the progress of  legislation. When it came to a critical moment for this legislation,  disproportionate demands on the parliamentary draftsman&rsquo;s office meant that six  other pieces of legislation will, in all likelihood, not see the light of day  in this mandate. That is the context in which the previous Minister, the  Department and every other Minister and Department worked, and all that is a  contributory factor to the situation that we face today.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have said that I am not hostile to amendments. I will  look at amendments that are forthcoming and determine whether it is appropriate  to consider, if not agree, them, and I will look independently at potential  amendments of my own. In doing so, however, I will not deny or diminish the  context that gave rise to the situation today where the Bill is more limited  than we would like it to be. However, that is a consequence of political  circumstances that were certainly beyond the control and command of the  previous Minister for Social Development and her Department. If the Member  wants to berate people, as he is entitled to, let us put on record the  political context that arose over the past couple of years and that led &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I will give way in a second. That context led to some  of the frustrations, which I agree with, that Members expressed today.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  Again, that is all well and good and is, obviously, part of the process that  Ministers go through. However, the fact of life remains that, over two years  ago, I proposed a motion, which everyone in the Chamber supported, that called  for the mandatory registration of landlords and all that goes with it. The  motion directed the previous Minister to do something about that, but nothing  was done. The Minister cannot say that that was held up because of the passage  of other Bills through the Executive. The will to deal with it needed to be  there.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: If the Member is going to concentrate on any issue, I  suggest that that is not the one. The Bill not only brings about the mandatory  registration of landlords but does so in double quick time. Under the  provisions of the Bill, if it is passed, the Department will be able to  introduce regulations that establish the registry of private landlords on a  mandatory basis. By doing it that way, rather than by putting it in other  pieces of legislation further down the tracks, the Bill can, essentially,  fast-forward the mandatory registration of landlords.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Forgive me if I do not recall the debate, but if it was the  case that, a couple of years ago, there was unanimity in this Chamber for the mandatory  registration of landlords, rather than feel let down by the Department, the  Member should applaud and congratulate the Department because it has fulfilled  his and the Assembly&rsquo;s ambitions.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  The Minister said that she was opposed to it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: If the Minister said that she was opposed to it, that  is a different matter. I will check the Hansard report on that. The eloquence  of Mr McCann&rsquo;s argument must have prevailed upon the previous Minister,  because, despite the failure of other people to govern this place properly and  diligently, despite the fact that others held up government for 150 days, as  they did a couple of years ago, and despite the failures and fault lines in  government, the previous Minister heard what the Member and others said and  included that provision in the Bill. Therefore, I suggest that the Member  acknowledge, congratulate and applaud Margaret Ritchie, because, if he is  right, she, despite herself, concurred with him. In fact, she went further, as  I will outline when I discuss later all the matters that were raised in the debate.  During the debate, I will undertake to consider carefully further amendments to  the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As a Minister, I have a very simple attitude. I am here for  10 months, and, as I hope some of my officials can testify, I intend to try to  get 30 months of business done in the next 10 months. That would mean that,  when I walk out of the Department not a long time from now, a legacy will be  left that demonstrates that I built on what Margaret Ritchie did in three  years. If I can graft onto this legislation and, indeed, the Caravans Bill,  although the opportunities there are more limited, I make the commitment that  it is my ambition to try to do more rather than to try to stop more.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is only appropriate that I respond first to the first  intervention of the day, which was made by Mr Easton. For the record, my  officials tell me that he intervened at 1.40 pm. Mr Easton asked whether  persons evicted by the Housing Executive can be rehoused in hostels, and the  matter is clearly at the forefront of his mind. The advice that I am being  given is that persons who have been evicted by the Housing Executive for  antisocial behaviour are not normally eligible to be rehoused by the Housing Executive  or a registered housing association but that there is no reason why they should  not be accommodated in a hostel that is operated by the voluntary sector. To  answer the Member&rsquo;s specific query: although there may be limitations to what  those people get from the housing association and the Housing Executive, that  does not extend to hostels. If further clarification is needed, I will come  back to the Member.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Craig, Mr McCann and other Members asked legitimate  questions about why matters that were covered by the consultation paper are not  included in the Bill. I do not want to go back over the political history, but  we are now in a very tight legislative time frame. I spoke to Mr Hamilton this  morning at the launch of the master plan for the town centre in Newtownards,  and he told me about his Committee&rsquo;s heavy legislative duties. As Mr Craig  said, Mr Hamilton sends his apologies for being unable to be here today because  of constituency business</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Unless legislation goes through all stages of the process  by Christmas or the very early part of the new year, we will run out of time,  because legislation falls if it is not passed within the lifetime of the  mandate. Therefore, for historic reasons that are now coming home to roost,  every Minister has a limited window of opportunity. Given that there will be an  election next May, if legislation does not receive Royal Assent in the very  early part of 2011 &mdash; by February, let us say &mdash; we will run out of time. There  is always a concern about parties bartering in the last week or two of a  mandate to try to get legislation over the line. Indeed, we saw that in the  Westminster Parliament in the wash-up before the election. That can lead to bad  legislation or bad policy being put on the statute book. If we are to be wise  and measured and fulfil our obligations as legislatures, we have between now  and February 2011 to legislate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">By my reckoning, we have less than 20 weeks of Assembly  time to legislate. This morning, Mr Hamilton remarked that four pieces of  legislation will be going through the Committee for Social Development. The  narrow window of opportunity, the need to get legislation right, the history of  this legislature and the restrictions on the parliamentary draftsmen all set  the context for what some Members consider to be useful but nonetheless  moderate legislation; I do not disagree with them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Nonetheless, it is important to put on record that a range  of other matters were in the consultation paper but are not now in the Bill. To  go back to a point made by Mr Easton and Mr Craig, those issues may, if I have  my way, be included in a future Bill. One such issue is work on raising the  fitness standard for the private rented sector. However, I am mindful of our  budgetary position, and such a measure could have significant regulatory and  cost implications. Therefore, it has to be managed and drafted carefully.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The proposal to extend the notice of quit period for  tenants in the private rented sector was welcomed. There seems to be a  consensus on the proposal, which does not appear to be controversial. Given  that and the fact that it only seems appropriate to give tenants of long  standing a longer notice of quit period, it seems that that area of the Bill  might be open to amendment. I look forward to amendments coming forward, and I  will share in that conversation. Given that the issue seems to have been  consulted on, has no specific equality implications and stacks up against all  political and legislative standards, it could be one that we take further.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A number of Members raised the issue of community safety.  Mr McCann will confirm that only this week we had a conversation and meeting  about houses in the lower Falls; namely, the Ross Street flats and cottages. I think  that Mr McCann and I are on the same page on that. Over and above the issues  about that accommodation &mdash; I have said before that I do not rule anything in or  out &mdash; I believe that making decisions on housing without being able to make  decisions on community safety, the roads and the environment in that area may  mean that good work will be done in the short term but that, in the longer  term, the community will be short-changed. Dealing with housing issues without  dealing with community safety issues, although not necessarily self-defeating,  could mean that we may not achieve all that we can reasonably achieve.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, I have some sympathy with the views on the fact  that the consultation document tested a number of proposals on community  safety. I do not intend to go through all those proposals. However, there is  some early possibility of amendment to enable the Housing Executive to  participate in crime prevention initiatives. It so happens that it does  already. My Department funds the Housing Executive to fund community  restorative justice schemes in Belfast.  I think that the Housing Executive funds six separate schemes in respect of  alternative measures and a number of other schemes involving Restorative  Justice Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It may be appropriate to confirm that the Housing Executive  is so entitled to fund by putting on a statutory basis the Housing Executive&rsquo;s  ability to make contributions to community safety initiatives. That would  require a more technical amendment of confirmation than one that would move  things further along. However, I am certainly prepared to look at that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Five or six other measures to deal with community safety  were outlined in the consultation document. I do not intend to rehearse all  those, but I will speak with officials, whom I see looking coyly at me. If  there are one or two other areas in which we can enhance the Bill without  creating further undue delay or fallout, I will look at them.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Craig and Mr McCann asked why the Bill is not tougher on  landlords, and they asked about the proper enforcement of good practice on bad  landlords; they also mentioned minimising the cost and bureaucracy of  regulation in the private-rented sector. The Bill represents a light-touch  approach to landlord registration; however, a light-touch approach does not  mean that the proposals are lightweight. It is a matter of striking a balance  between an appropriate scheme that works and one that does not become unwieldy  and burdensome on the taxpayer. The scheme that is outlined in the Bill, in our  view, strikes the appropriate balance. I say that because the process for  future mandatory landlord registration will be as straightforward and  inexpensive as possible and will not, therefore, put an undue burden on the  good landlord &mdash; a point that was raised, I think, by Mr Craig. Nonetheless, new  systems should ensure better standards across the sector, particularly for  landlords who are on the wrong side of the argument.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  The crux of the issue of landlord registration is that mandatory registration,  in itself, will do nothing to deal with the bigger problem of poor and bad  landlords. All Members will admit that the private-rented sector plays an  essential part in the provision of housing across the board. However, the  sector has grown at an amazing rate in recent years, and, unless we have strong  restrictions &mdash; perhaps that is the wrong word &mdash; or certain levels of compliance  to ensure that those people abide by the rules and regulations, the  registration scheme will go nowhere.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I concur with the Member&rsquo;s view, which goes back to his  first intervention during my opening speech. The register should be a  comprehensive record of landlords in Northern Ireland. As a consequence,  as I have said, given the provisions that will exist, for example, between the  registry and local councils to share information so that they will know who  owns property, appropriate enforcement action can be taken. If a tenant has  issues about the fitness of his or her property, and there is an evidence trail  from the registry to the local council on issues of unfitness, he or she will  have the opportunity to take action against the named landlord. Therefore,  having the registry will answer the question that the Member asked. A circle  will be created from the tenant to the registry, through the council and the  landlord and back to the tenant. That will create a vice, for want of a better  word, around those who offend against fitness standards and act as a shield to  protect the good landlord and as a sword to be used against the bad landlord.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As we speak, conversations are going on between the  relevant organisations, the Department, landlords&rsquo; and tenants&rsquo;  representatives, and other stakeholders to work through the detail of the  registration scheme. Therefore, especially given that there is tenant input into  that conversation, that will have an outcome, and the outcome will mean that  within a short period of months we will have the ability to issue the  regulations leading to the registration scheme&rsquo;s going live. In the context of  that conversation, I hope that the matters that the Member has, rightly, raised  in respect not just of registration but of enforcement will be dealt with.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In my view there is one single lesson to be learned from  legislation in the North, and it can be seen throughout its history. I do not  mean to delve into controversial issues. However, if one looks at equality  provisions that exist here, it was not simply the case that good law was  created at various phases of recent history, but that there was effective  enforcement of that law. That created new standards and disciplines for both  private and public employers that were subject to employment legislation one  way or another, sometimes through exposure, the courts or regulations. In the  fullness of all that, new disciplines and standards were created. Although that  is a particular piece of history and current practice, nonetheless there are  good lessons and precedents that can be applied to other matters.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  Although I understand and appreciate what the Minister is saying, it does not  add up in many ways. I have had quite a bit of experience of dealing with  private landlords, some of whom were pretty poor. There is no mechanism to  allow the council, when it is contacted, to deal with issues. Again, that goes  back to the legislation&rsquo;s having no teeth. Although councils will send letters  and threaten to take landlords to court, they will say honestly that, over and  above that, there is nothing that they can do, effectively, to make landlords  deal with problems. There are many problems throughout the system.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I said earlier, when LANI came before the Committee, I  got the impression that many landlords are not opposed to registration. We  talked about controls in general. They also recognise that there are serious  problems in the sector that must be dealt with. Along with all of that, there  is intimidation of tenants by landlords, which makes it almost impossible for  them to report many of the issues. Overcharging must also be dealt with.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank the Member for his intervention. I concur with  him about the behaviour of some private landlords. Of course, it is not just  private landlords. I know of a case where I very much questioned the conduct of  an estate agent in respect of their management responsibility. As Members will  be aware, many landlords pass that on to estate agents. There have been some  acute cases. One, in particular, preoccupies me. The estate agent behaved in a  way that, if not illegal, was certainly irregular when it came to the treatment  of a tenant of decades&rsquo; standing. Therefore, I very much understand what the  Member is saying.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are alternatives. Either there is licence, where  landlords can do whatever they want, or we try to create new disciplines in the  private rented sector. Registration in itself will create some new disciplines.  It will enable best practice to be shared with landlords so that good ones can  be better educated and bad ones can be better informed about rights and  responsibilities. In parallel with the enforcement mechanisms that exist at the  moment, particularly court powers, which I will talk about shortly, that fabric  will have potential. Significant powers have been laid down with regard to  penalties to the courts in respect of some of those matters. Yes, there will be  cases where landlords try to buck the regulations and the courts and not fulfil  their responsibilities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, unless those in the Department and in councils  who are responsible for regulation measure up, a situation may arise in which  bad landlords continue to act badly. By creating a new architecture in which  new laws and systems are created and in which central and local government join  in governing private landlords, the disciplines for people to behave properly  and the opportunities to enforce against those who do not behave properly will  be created. That is the lesson of Northern Ireland. When one looks at  our history, one will see that behaviour has changed when we have had the right  laws and when the proper enforcement has been administered centrally and  locally.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If we were to take Fra McCann&rsquo;s view, it would have been  fair to ask what was the point in legislating, regulating or enforcing over the  past 40 years, because there was always going to be a minority of people who  would not accept best practice and who would not live up to their rights and  responsibilities. The lesson of Northern Ireland and other democracies is that  when regulation, best laws and enforcement mechanisms are created, and when  everyone does what they are supposed to do within that architecture, in time,  those who are in error will be exposed and will have to be held to account, and  those who are on the right side of the law will be held up as models of best  practice and as good examples. The same applies here. The same ethic, or the  same system, is informing this piece of legislation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The legislation is not the be-all and end-all. That is why  I have said that I am open to certain amendments and that I will look at  others. In any case, if we get to a time when we have not only a stable  Parliament but one that fulfils all its legislative functions, there will be a  third housing Bill, which will deal with some of the issues that I am about to  talk about.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Jonathan Craig made a valid point in the context of the  financial environment that we may be facing over the next while. He spoke about  the costs and bureaucracy associated with tenancy deposit schemes and landlord  registration schemes. As I indicated earlier, the Department is working with  landlords, councils, the Housing Executive and organisations that represent  tenants to develop the landlord registration scheme and the tenancy deposit  scheme. That is a work in progress. I was speaking to officials about it this  morning, and I hope that that work will be concluded in a short number of  months. The details of what may emerge will have to be considered by the Committee,  and, through Mr Craig to the Committee Chairperson, I will come back with the  fine details on the cost and bureaucracy of the deposit scheme and the  registration scheme.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am not in a position to answer Mr Craig&rsquo;s question about  the treatment of migrants who are not eligible for social housing, so I will  write to the Committee on that issue. Anna Lo raised the same issue. I will  have briefings, and that is a matter that I want to consider further. I do not  want to return to a previous debate on parity; immigration is not a devolved  matter but a reserved matter. Therefore, the policies and practices that govern  housing and benefit entitlement are strictly beyond our capacity. I will get  back to the Committee and other Members on that issue, as well as on the issue  of whether the technical matter that is mentioned in the Bill, and to which Ms  Lo referred, will impact on a small number of less than 10. I would be grateful  to the Member for South Belfast Ms Lo, if, given her experience of working with  the migrant and immigrant community, she has further information on whether the  scale is greater than officials have said, she would let me know.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I give the same reassurance that the former Minister gave.  When acute situations occur, as they often have, there is an obligation on the  Government to stretch themselves. When the acute situation arose involving the  Roma population, my Department, other Departments and Members demonstrated  that, whatever the ostensible limits of our responsibility in law, there will  be critical moments when one goes further.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That echoes the point that Fra McCann rightly made that one  of my first duties as a Minister was to open the Welcome Organisation&rsquo;s  Waterfront Hall exhibition of photographs of homeless people. Although that exhibition  has ended, the pictures tell the story. Ms Lo asked that we consult the Welcome  Organisation about relevant provisions of the Bill. I assure her that I will  ask officials to do that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Craig raised the issue of penalties for landlords who do  not abide by tenancy deposit schemes, and asked how we will ensure that bad  landlords comply. Fra McCann also mentioned that issue. The Bill provides for  persons who require deposits consisting of property other than money to be:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding  level 4 on the standard scale.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Other contraventions will be punishable:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding  &pound;20,000.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is also provision in the Bill for persons who appear  to have contravened a tenancy deposit scheme to be penalised by paying a fixed  penalty. The enforcement powers will lie with district councils, but the Bill  makes provision for a scheme administrator to share information with councils  to support their proper enforcement of the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On reflection, it might be useful, as the Bill is currently  drafted, to create a matrix or flow chart that details visually how the new  systems will work, where enforcement powers lie and what the consequences of  those enforcement powers being used would give rise to. If people saw that  picture or that matrix, it might go some way to mitigate Members&rsquo; concerns  about whether enforcement will measure up.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Ms Lo also raised the issue of items that were not included  in the next housing Bill. As I said earlier, I want to give a commitment that  those items that could not be included for the reasons that I have outlined  will be considered for inclusion or included in the next housing Bill, which,  unfortunately, will not be introduced until the next mandate. That is over and  above the reassurance that I gave the House in relation to one or two  particular matters that have arisen.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Easton asked whether the landlord&rsquo;s name rather than  that of the agent would be on the landlord register. That is an important  point, because people may be seen to be slipping and sliding, for want of a  better phrase, in that regard. I note that point. The details of the  registration scheme are being discussed with a wide range of stakeholders.  However, it is certainly within the gift of the Department, when it comes to  regulation, to define those matters, as I understand it, in a way that may  satisfy the Member&rsquo;s concerns and those of other Members. I am not prejudging  the matter: it seems, at face value, that the landlord should be accountable  and that there should be no safe refuge, for want of a better term. In the real  world, it may not mean that much in many instances, because, if the agent can  be reached, so can the landlord. However, it seems a rather circuitous way of  going about things. I will raise that issue with the stakeholders who are  discussing that matter.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">If there are any other matters that I failed to  address &mdash; I am sure that there are, because Mr McCann alone raised a baker&rsquo;s  dozen &mdash; I will come back to Members, and we can have a further discussion about  all of those matters at Committee. I am grateful to all Members who contributed  to a helpful debate. It certainly helped to inform me, and I intend to have  some concentrated conversations with my officials in the near future. Mr Deputy  Speaker, I commend the Bill to you for the House&rsquo;s approval.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That the Second Stage of the Housing (Amendment) (No.  2) Bill (NIA 32/09) be agreed.</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading"><a name="e"></a>Welfare Reform Bill</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Final Stage</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development &nbsp;(Mr Attwood)</strong>: I  beg to move</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That the Final Stage of the Welfare Reform Bill (NIA  13/09) do now pass.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Welfare Reform Bill makes provisions corresponding to Westminster&rsquo;s Welfare  Reform Act 2009. During the debate, I will touch on some of the matters that were  rehearsed at Committee and Consideration Stages, add something in one or two  areas and update the House on developments since Further Consideration Stage.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I advise the House that, following Iain Duncan Smith&rsquo;s  speech on welfare reform, which he made shortly after the new coalition  Government was formed, I wrote to the secretary of state for welfare. I  requested an early meeting with him or other senior Ministers to discuss their  intentions. Much water has flowed under the bridge since then. The Chancellor  has made various comments, and other announcements have been made on the  British Government&rsquo;s position on the welfare reform agenda.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As time had moved on, I pressed for a meeting to be  organised sooner rather than later. Consequently, a meeting with Lord Freud,  the Minister with particular responsibility for welfare reform, is now  scheduled for Thursday 22 July. That will be an opportunity for me, on behalf,  I trust, of the Assembly, to scope out to Lord Freud my position and that of  many other Members. Mindful of the issue of parity, we consider that, when it  comes to welfare issues, there should be due regard given to the circumstances  and conditions in the North and to the wider nature of our politics.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is the case, for example, that take-up levels of  disability living allowance are higher in the North than in Britain. In Northern Ireland, the take-up rate is 20% higher  than in Wales.  However, I sense that there are good reasons why that is the case. I have  tasked officials in the Department to develop a matrix to explain why  disability living allowance (DLA) take-up levels might be higher in the North.  I asked them to outline, based on our history, health profile and multiple  levels of deprivation, the grounds on which those figures can be explained and  understood. The London  authorities must have an appreciation of those factors.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That was only an example of the conversation that I intend  to have with Lord Freud. I intend to make clear to him the circumstances that  exist in the North. There has been much talk about welfare reform coming across  the Irish Sea. I will outline the consequences  of that to him.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I confirm my intention to push operational flexibility in Northern Ireland,  without breaching parity, as is appropriate. In that way, I will try to  mitigate some of the consequences and impact of current and previous welfare  legislation on the communities and citizens in the North.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I would welcome a debate on the issue of parity among  political parties in the Assembly and the wider devolved institutions. When I  was at the British-Irish Council summit in Guernsey last week, I took the  opportunity to discuss that issue with representatives and Ministers from the  Scottish Government and Welsh Assembly in respect of how to frame it, how to  take it forward, and how to consider it in a wise and rounded way without  rushing in and causing further difficulties for citizens and communities in the  North.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At one time or another, it falls to a Minister to concede  to the House that he or she got something totally wrong, badly wrong or  slightly wrong. On this occasion, I must concede to the House that I got  something slightly wrong. I, therefore, wish to clarify a statement that I made  during the Bill&rsquo;s Consideration Stage on a report received from the Scottish  Government, which was quite moderate in its ambition, on the possibility of  devolving responsibility for the social fund and the circumstances in which it  might be appropriate to devolve responsibility for social security. I should  have made it clear at that time that responsibility for the policy and  administration of the social fund has already been devolved to the Northern  Ireland Assembly, which is not the case with the Scottish Government. I,  therefore, wish to confirm that fact now. I always knew it; I just tripped up.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will now comment briefly on some issues. The Bill  introduces powers for the &ldquo;work for your benefit&rdquo; programme. The programme will  be designed to assist jobseekers to move closer to the labour market, to help  them to find sustained work and to provide them with the experiences and  training to move out of welfare. As I said at Consideration Stage, that  programme is being piloted in four areas of Britain,  and its introduction in Northern    Ireland will only be considered after a full  evaluation of them. I wish to confirm that point, because there was some  misunderstanding about it previously.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The programme is being piloted in four areas in Britain, and only when those pilots are finished  and have been evaluated in Britain  will there be any consideration of piloting such a scheme in Northern Ireland.  Therefore, that is at least a couple of years, if not more, down the track.  Even then, it will fall to the Department for Employment and Learning to  determine &mdash; no doubt in consultation with the Committee, if not the House  &mdash;whether or not to go down the road of running a pilot here and what the terms  of that might be. In any case, other events may overtake that, and the  responsibility for welfare reform may move to a different place, should Iain  Duncan Smith, the Chancellor and the British Government get their way. As I  said, the Department for Employment and Learning will decide those matters.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am sure that Members are aware that following the recent  emergency Budget, the coalition Government are reviewing all employment and  training programmes, including &ldquo;work for your benefit&rdquo; and progression to work  pilots, for which provision is made in clause 2. Wise men might choose to  speculate about what will happen in the future. However, given that I have been  a Minister for only six weeks, I fail the test of wisdom and will, therefore,  not speculate on such matters.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The work-related activity provision in clause 2 will also  initially be piloted in Britain,  and only after the evaluation of that pilot will its introduction in Northern Ireland  be considered. During the Bill&rsquo;s Consideration Stage, I gave assurances that  vulnerable people, such as lone parents, those with physical and mental health  conditions and those with caring responsibilities, will not be penalised should  they not be able to participate in the &ldquo;work for your benefit&rdquo; programme or  work-related activity because of their circumstances. I repeat that assurance;  namely, that the safeguards and flexibilities in current legislation and the  Bill, for instance the good cause safeguards, will ensure that no one will be  penalised or sanctioned, except in particular circumstances where that is  deemed to be necessary, appropriate and proportionate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also assure the House that the guidance will ensure that  decision-makers make full use of their discretion and consider the well-being  of a child when considering good cause in their decision-making process.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 3 contains important safeguards for lone parents on  income support, jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and employment and support allowance.  Those additional safeguards will form part of the wider framework of  flexibilities that is already in place to help parents to balance family life  and work. I stress that, at the heart of clause 3, is the saving provision that  people will not be required to go down certain roads unless they have in place  adequate, affordable and appropriate childcare.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Yesterday, I read figures confirming that, in Northern  Ireland, about 22% or 23% of the population &mdash; I was not able to check the  reference before I came into the Chamber &mdash; has access to appropriate and  affordable childcare; the comparable figure in England is about 80%. That  demonstrates the scale of the childcare issue in the North and the urgency with  which it must be resolved. Yesterday, there was a further meeting of the  relevant ministerial subgroup, and I hope that its work will mature quickly and  in time for the budgetary negotiations that will take place over the next couple  of months. Those figures also demonstrate the provisions in the North in  respect of what people may be required to do subject, for example, to  affordable and appropriate childcare, to which 80% of the population does not  have access. Those figures are off the top of my head; if they are slightly  wrong, I will come back to the House and apologise again. However, in the  round, that conveys the sense of the childcare provision.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill contains powers to ensure that those on employment  and support allowance in the work-related activity group undertake activity  that is most appropriate to addressing their individual barriers to work. The  reforms will deliver better, more flexible and more appropriate support to  people across the spectrum of out-of-work benefits. I emphasise that only those  who can do so will be expected to participate in &ldquo;work for your benefit&rdquo;  programmes or any work-related activity. I assure Members again that factors,  such as a lack of childcare, care responsibilities, the well-being of a child,  learning difficulties, and physical or mental disabilities and conditions, will  be taken into account. Decisions, for example, on health conditions and  learning difficulties will be based on the expertise of healthcare  professionals. As I said during the Bill&rsquo;s previous Stage, we will also involve  voluntary disability organisations when providing the necessary guidance and  training to decision-makers.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">People moving from income support to a modified form of  jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance will retain the same amount of benefit and be subject to  the same conditionality. I assure Members that we will not move carers from  income support until there is a clear plan setting out how the benefits system  will be reformed over the longer term.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Powers are being provided to improve the delivery of  community care grants to allow us to contract with third-party providers to  provide items such as white goods at a much lower cost. I repeat my assurances  that the Social Development Committee will be consulted during the proposed procurement  process.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At Consideration Stage, I gave assurances that, when a  person fails to attend a mandatory appointment, sanctions will be applied only  where absolutely necessary. Personal advisers and decisions-makers will  consider whether a person had good cause before considering sanctions. All  factors of a case will be taken into account. Hardship payments will help to  ensure that the basic needs of vulnerable claimants or their families continue  to be met while underlying entitlements to passport benefits, housing benefit  and free school meals will remain unchanged.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Part 2 of the Bill increases parental responsibility by  including further changes to child maintenance legislation. The Bill is  designed to work with people to help to lift them out of poverty; it is  designed to be flexible enough that the requirements placed on people are  aligned to their circumstances. It is designed to ensure that the expectations  of any claimant are realistic and achievable.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill is about ensuring that the welfare system provides  people with the opportunities that they need to improve their skills, and it is  about supporting and preparing them for work and for the move off benefits and  into employment where that is appropriate. It is also about helping people out  of disadvantage and poverty. As I said, I am aware that Members have concerns  about some of the Bill&rsquo;s provisions. Indeed, I also said that I have  reservations myself. However, I assure Members that all operational  flexibilities and those flexibilities that are in the legislation will be  considered.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">During Consideration Stage, I said that I would meet with  Les Allamby, the director of the Law Centre, before Further Consideration Stage  to discuss a number of issues in the Bill, including parity and flexibilities.  I met him on 16 June, and we had a useful conversation about how the Department  for Work and Pensions (DWP) viewed the parity issue and how that created  constraints on this Department. However, we also discussed how we were,  nonetheless, trying to maximise operational flexibility. I have attempted to  have a further conversation with Les Allamby since, and if he is listening, or  if he reads the Hansard report, I apologise to him for not returning his phone  calls. However, I will get back to him.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I intend to meet Lord Freud on 22 July, when we will scope  out my and the Department&rsquo;s views on welfare reform. No doubt, he will outline  his and his Government&rsquo;s ambitions. I will consult with stakeholders on any new  provisions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am grateful to the Chairperson, members of the Committee  for Social Development and Members of the Assembly for the positive way that  they worked with me and my officials to move the Bill forward. I thank Members  for all their contributions. I hope that, in taking forward any provisions on  welfare reform, we can have the same useful conversation.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I call Mr Jonathan Craig, who is speaking on behalf of the  Committee for Social Development.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>:  Again, I start by apologising for the Committee Chairperson&rsquo;s absence. The Committee  for Social Development spent a great deal of time and devoted a lot of energy  to the consideration of the Welfare Reform Bill. As the House is aware, the  Committee produced a report that sets out members&rsquo; work during the  pre-legislative consultation phase, the Second Stage, and, particularly, the  Committee Stage of the Bill. The length and detail of the report reflect  members&rsquo; interest in and concern about social security issues in the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On behalf of the Chairperson, I thank members of the Committee  for Social Development for their contributions. I also want to place on the  record the Committee&rsquo;s thanks to the many witnesses who, at various times,  provided such useful written and oral submissions. On behalf of the Committee,  I thank the Minister for the assurances that he provided at Consideration  Stage. I also thank the departmental officials, who provided a fast turnaround  on Committee queries. Finally, I thank the Committee staff, who produced the  report in a very limited time.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Before dealing with the content of the Bill, I want to make  a brief reference to the timing of the stages of the Bill in the Assembly. The  Committee noted with disappointment the gap between its consideration of the  equality impact assessment (EQIA) and the Department&rsquo;s introduction of the  Bill. Had the Department secured agreement to introduce the Bill shortly after  the EQIA was completed, or at least before the Easter recess, the burden on  witnesses, members and staff would have been considerably reduced and scrutiny  of the Bill would have been enhanced.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Faced with delays and to ensure the minimum possible  disbenefit to social security claimants in Northern Ireland, members  diligently undertook additional meetings and scrupulously considered a  significant volume of evidence in a very short time. It is hoped that, as we  enter a very busy period of Assembly legislation, the Department will in future  arrange in a more timely manner those stages for which it has responsibility</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I wish, simply and briefly, to address the content of the  Welfare Reform Bill. As the House is well aware, the majority of Committee  members and MLAs support the principle of maintaining parity with the rest of  the United Kingdom  in respect of social security, pensions and child maintenance matters. As a  consequence, and following debate and division, the majority of members of the  Social Development Committee agreed that there was no opportunity to amend the  Bill without endangering the generally beneficial access to social security  that is afforded to claimants in Northern Ireland. A minority of  members disagreed on that point. Notwithstanding the majority of members&rsquo;  concerns in respect of breaking parity, the Committee nevertheless critically  reviewed and earnestly debated the clauses of the Bill, and sought to secure  important assurances in areas where most members felt that amendment did not  appear possible.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Chief among the members&rsquo; anxieties was the possible impact  of the Bill on vulnerable claimants, particularly those with childcare  problems, mental illness, learning disabilities, caring responsibilities, or  victims of domestic violence. Members were pleased to receive ministerial  assurances that guidance to benefits advisers would be set out and that  additional and appropriate consideration would be given to such claimants.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In respect of mandatory work-for-benefit schemes, the  majority of Committee members believe that those provisions are a part of the  parity package and, therefore, have to be accepted. Members also realise that,  like a number of provisions in the Bill, those schemes may be subject to  further and possibly much more radical Westminster  legislation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The House held a very useful Consideration Stage debate on  the additional conditionality provision for lone-parent claimants, which is  included in the Bill. Although everyone understood the sentiments of those who  proposed related amendments and even, in all honesty, shared some of their  concerns, the majority of Members accepted the Minister&rsquo;s assurances in  relation to the interpretation of the &ldquo;good cause&rdquo; provisions and, therefore,  agreed to support that aspect of the Bill, albeit with a number of  reservations. Members also welcomed ministerial assurances in relation to  continued access for carers &mdash; whether they are in receipt of caring benefits or  not &mdash; and employment support allowance (ESA) or income support and its related  payment to the training regime.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Members were greatly concerned by the provisions of the  Bill that related to the abolition of income support. The Social Development  Committee has taken a great interest in the migration of claimants from  incapacity benefit and income support to employment and support allowance and  jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance. Members were glad to receive ministerial assurances that  carers and other vulnerable groups will not be transferred from income support  until alternative benefits are in place. However, during consideration of  recent secondary legislation, members indicated that they are still nervous  about the Social Security Agency&rsquo;s ability to manage the transfer, over the next  three years, of some 76,000 income support claimants to employment and support  allowance and jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee&rsquo;s acceptance of the abolition of income  support is dependent on our continuing close scrutiny of the transfer of  claimants to other benefits. I assure the House that members will continue that  work and will constructively advise the Department on improving related  services to vulnerable claimants. The Committee was happy to receive  ministerial assurances in respect of the passporting of claimants in receipt of  income support and statutory sick pay to other benefits.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Additionally, in respect of clause 15, the Committee was  glad to receive assurances relating to the procurement of goods and services  associated with community care grants.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Some Members felt strongly that the substitution of grants  with goods might lead to additional bureaucracy costs and poor product quality.  The Committee welcomed ministerial assurances that best practice will be  employed when goods and services are procured in relation to community care  grants and that the Committee will be consulted by the Department prior to the  completion of relevant contracts. I hope that the Minister follows through on  that, because there is quite a probability that there will be abuses there.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">One of the more contentious aspects of the Bill was the new  proposals for benefit sanctions. Although all Members oppose benefit fraud and  the threat or use of violence against benefits office staff, there was some  disagreement about whether benefit sanctions should be applied in addition to  court sanctions. Members also questioned the effectiveness of sanctioning  claimants for non-compliance with directions or failure to attend interviews.  The Committee was interested in and surprised by the evidence presented by the  Law Centre on the subject. Members were also somewhat reassured by the  Department&rsquo;s confirmation that the families of claimants would not be adversely  affected by sanctions and that the good cause provision would protect the  mentally ill and vulnerable from unfair sanctioning. Despite the Committee&rsquo;s  misgivings and as I have indicated, the majority of members accepted the  provisions as drafted as an unavoidable part of the parity package.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although Members did not generally welcome the provisions  of the Bill, they were pleased to see clause 23, which increases the exemption  period from job-seeking conditions for victims of domestic violence. Members  noted that the overall exemption period for claimants could amount to around 24  weeks, a period that it was felt would be similar to that generally available  to employees in the same circumstances. Members also noted that benefit  advisers will consider physical, psychological and financial abuse when  assessing victims of domestic violence. That is all to be welcomed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I have said, Members found many of the provisions of the  Welfare Reform Bill to be challenging &mdash; that may be an understatement. The  majority of the Committee felt that the Bill had to be accepted in order to  maintain parity with the rest of the UK on social security matters.  Crucial to Members&rsquo; acceptance of the Bill was the ministerial assurance that  good cause for non-compliance with its provisions would include childcare  issues, mental illness, learning disability, other caring responsibilities and  domestic violence. That assurance along with others on the recognition of the  uniqueness of Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s situation in respect of childcare  and the use of appropriate, informed discretion by benefit advisers are the  most important of the numerous assurances given by the Minister.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee noted the absence from the Bill of provisions  relating to the piloting of the automatic payment of state pension credit.  Again, the Committee accepted a ministerial assurance that, if and when  automatic payment of state pension credit is rolled out nationally, Northern Ireland  claimants would not miss out.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to indicate clearly that I am speaking as a Member  of the Assembly from this point on and not on behalf of the Chairperson of the  Committee for Social Development. My party and I support, in principle, any  reforms to our welfare system that encourage those who are able to work and  want to work to get back into work. Although that appears to be the basis of  the Bill, it remains to be seen whether that noble objective can be achieved:  that is open to question.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to dwell on the issue not of principle but of  process. The Bill is unique as social security legislation in that it did not  have accelerated passage. Instead, it had a proper Committee Stage. Assembly  Committees and Members would generally not argue against a Committee Stage,  because our duty and primary responsibility is to scrutinise legislation  robustly. However, I seriously question the value of the Committee Stage in  this instance. I do not know what was going on in the mind of the former  Minister and, I suspect, neither does the current Minister. Nevertheless, when  she delayed, then further delayed and ultimately decided against seeking  accelerated passage, she brought about a technical breach of parity in the  process. I emphasise &ldquo;technical&rdquo; because it turned out to be very technical and  because we have not been allowed to make any major changes. I remain unconvinced  that, in doing us the dubious honour of granting a Committee Stage, the  previous Minister did the Committee a favour. In fact, I firmly believe that  the Committee was placed in the invidious position of taking reams of evidence  from concerned stakeholders, only to have to ultimately ignore it because we  had been warned of the grave consequences of proposing any amendment that  risked breaching parity.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The cynic in me says that the Committee, rather than the  Department, was deliberately placed in the position of being the bad guy who  had to turn down amendments. In all sincerity, what is the point of a Committee  Stage in which the Committee cannot consider amendments and is told by  officials that there is no scope for even the smallest of changes? The  practical implications of the Committee&rsquo;s enduring a sham Committee Stage are  many. We set aside weeks, during which we met twice weekly, to get the Bill  through Committee Stage as quickly as possible, so as not to delay its passage  any further than the former Minister had already done. Weeks of evidence, hours  upon hours of deliberations, and what was the outcome? Not one single amendment  would have been acceptable. The assurances that we sought and received as a  Committee could have been attained in other ways.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Due to our heavy legislative schedule in the Committee,  those weeks lost to the Welfare Reform Bill came at a cost. A Committee inquiry  into housing had been proposed, about which I feel particularly sore because I  proposed it. That inquiry was to have looked into alternative ways of funding  social housing. As we all know, funding will become a major issue for the House  over the next 10 months, never mind the next few years. However, it looks like  that inquiry will have to be jettisoned. I ask the Minister what would have  been more useful: the Committee Stage on a Bill that could not be changed or an  inquiry into an important housing issue that might ultimately have assisted the  Minister in providing more social housing? In future, will the Minister or his  successor carefully consider the merits or otherwise of having a Committee  Stage on legislation that is so clearly and totally locked into the issue of  parity that the Committee has little or no ability to change it?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">You will be glad to hear, Mr Deputy Speaker, that that is  my little rant about my personal feelings over. In conclusion, on behalf of the  Chairperson of the Committee, I should like to indicate that, despite the  Committee&rsquo;s many concerns, of which the House is aware, the Committee  nonetheless, given the ministerial assurances received, recommends that the  Second Stage of the Welfare Reform Bill be agreed.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Unlike Mr Craig, I am not of a  cynical nature. I am delighted to hear that the Minister will meet Lord Freud  on 22 July. In relation to this Bill, Sigmund Freud might have been a better  choice, but that is just a personal observation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will begin by dealing with the positive aspects of the  Bill, which should take only a very short time. One positive aspect is the fact  that DLA payments to visually impaired people will be factored in, although we  are not sure about the outworkings of that. Nevertheless, it will give those  people access to a high rate of mobility allowance, which is a positive step  that has been required for a long time. The exemption from job-seeking  conditions for victims of domestic violence was mentioned, and the exemption  period will be raised to 24 weeks. Again, that is positive. The Minister  assured us that best practice will be used in respect of the social fund, which  is to be welcomed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In Committee, a witness suggested that a more appropriate  title for the Bill would be &ldquo;The welfare reform cart before the horse policy on  a wing and a prayer and a nod and a wink Bill&rdquo;. The overall thrust of the Bill  is negative, because it will do little to improve the lot of the long-term  unemployed and the economically inactive, for whom getting back into work is an  aspiration. Those people should be encouraged and helped to do so.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill is sanction-led and punitive, particularly for  lone parents and people with mental health problems, drug and alcohol  dependency or particular disabilities, such as learning or visual problems.  That is particularly the case in respect of communication from local offices  and general contact with the Social Security Agency. The Minister assured us  that particular conditions will be taken into account, and I welcome that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister spoke about childcare provision. As yet, we do  not have a viable childcare strategy. The Minister quoted figures about  childcare provision: it is approximately 23% here, as opposed to 80% in England. In  2006, legislation was introduced in England  and Wales  that puts an onus on local authorities to provide childcare. If a gap is  identified, the local authority has to fill it. The Minister assured us that  sanctions will not be imposed if childcare is not available here.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister talked about having a discussion about parity,  but Jonathan Craig said that everything to do with parity is set in stone. At  least that is the impression that Committee members get, because, in all the  social security legislation that has been introduced, there was a lot of talk  about parity. The Minister also assured us that staff will be trained to a high  standard and will be able to cope with particular cases. Yet, at the same time,  we are told that 207 people in the Social Security Agency will probably lose  their job. I am sure that the Minister means what he says about those  assurances. However, Ministers come and go, and he did say that he is trying to  fit 30 months&rsquo; work into 10 months. I hope that he can manage that difficult  task.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In my experience, if sanctions are available, they will  eventually be used. The Department would not have put them in place unless it  intended to use them at some stage, whether to a greater of lesser degree. The  Bill will mean that lone parents with very young children will eventually be  required to claim jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and seek work. Again, the Minister  assured us that each case will be considered sympathetically and that, if  childcare is not available, no sanctions will be imposed. If that policy is  carried through, the age at which the sanction applies will, eventually, go as  low as one. The parent of a one-year-old will be expected to look for work-related  activity, not necessarily actively but reasonably.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Jonathan Craig mentioned income support, which, unless a  viable alternative is suggested, will be phased out. The Minister said that the  impact of that on carers and other vulnerable groups will be lessened, but, in  reality, we are talking about 76,000 people&rsquo;s benefit migrating from income  support to employment and support allowance. The logistics of that will cause  great difficulty.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is also the intention to introduce work-focused interviews  for over 60s, which could result in many people losing benefit entitlements.  The use of sanctions against people who have been convicted through the courts  for the use of violence or threat of violence against social security staff and  those already convicted of benefit fraud can only be seen as punitive. Again, I  make the point that I have the greatest sympathy for social security staff,  having been one myself for a period. I certainly do not condone, in any shape  or form, violence against social security staff, who do a tremendous job under  great pressure. They manage very well without adequate resources.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Parity has been quoted extensively in discussions and in  the scrutiny of the legislation. However, pilot schemes will be implemented in Britain, so why  are those schemes not being implemented here? The issues around the take-up of  state pension credit, which, again, was mentioned previously, will be dealt  with in Britain  through a pilot scheme. Why not here? Effectively, from the point of view of parity,  we are being asked to implement legislation that is prescriptive and can only  impact negatively on people here. The legislation has not been thought out  properly and its outworkings have not been considered fully.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is very little in the Welfare Reform Bill that  safeguards the dignity of the claimant. Iain Duncan Smith is now the Secretary  of State for Work and Pensions, and his Centre for Social Justice has published  a paper called &lsquo;Dynamic Benefits&rsquo;. In the Welfare Reform Bill, we are looking at  the thin end of the wedge. We have seen that already in the recent Budget.  Yesterday and the day before, the Chancellor talked about people on benefits  having to tighten their belt and take cuts. Undoubtedly, that will happen, so  we are seeing the thin end of the wedge. The Welfare Reform Bill is probably  the least punitive of the legislation that we can expect down the road.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Our function is not to enact bad legislation but to ensure  that the administration of benefits is carried out in a fair and equitable  manner. I welcome what the Minister said about operational flexibility.  Although the whole issue of parity is not to ruffle the feathers of the  Treasury in respect of the subvention &mdash; God forbid that we should do that &mdash; if  we can have in place a better operational structure, as happened with the  Committee&rsquo;s report on DLA, that has to be welcomed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We do not want legislation that marginalises and is  punitive to those who are most vulnerable in our society. That is part of the  problem that I have with the Bill. Although I have great reservations about it,  we do not intend to divide the House. I thank the members of the Committee for  Social Development and the staff, who have done a great deal of work in  producing a report that, I think, was 647 pages long. I also thank all the  people who were very helpful in giving evidence to the Committee. They shaped  our views and gave us a lot of evidence that may not have been available  previously..</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Armstrong</strong>:  I welcome the opportunity to speak at the Final Stage of the Welfare Reform  Bill. In general, the majority of the Committee has welcomed the reforms  contained in the Bill. It will further reform the welfare and benefit systems  in Northern Ireland  to improve support and incentives for people to move from benefits to work. It  will also have a bearing on the abolition of income support in the future.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is right that, in our society, the right to receive  benefits exists as a safety net. However, with rights come responsibilities.  One of the Bill&rsquo;s key goals is to break the cycle of welfare dependency. We are  all aware of the very high levels of economic inactivity in Northern Ireland.  However, many people who are currently not working do not want to work or are  capable of working but need support and retraining to enable them to get back  into active employment and pay tax. Work and a commitment to work, where  possible, is vital to an individual&rsquo;s financial, physical and mental  well-being. It also has a generational impact on the well-being of our  children.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Many aspects of the Bill will help people in great need. I  particularly commend the introduction of exemptions from job-seeking conditions  for victims of domestic violence. Tackling unemployment and welfare dependency  remains central to ensuring that people meet their potential in the workforce  and engender a positive and long-term contribution to society and pay tax.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I reiterate my earlier assertion that we need to be more  imaginative on how we address welfare reform effectively. As such, I look  forward to the proposals that the coalition Government at Westminster will introduce in due course. I  was disappointed by the delay in ensuring parity with the rest of the United Kingdom;  however, the timely manner in which we have sought to move this Bill through  the Committee and the House has sought to address that delay.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We must work alongside people and help to lift them out of  poverty to live lives that are fulfilling to them, their families and society.  Central to that is a commitment to work and to contribute fully to society.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  I welcome the information given by the Minister and the fact that he will meet  Lord Freud. I am sure that he will insist that the needs of the people of Northern Ireland  are not the same as those elsewhere. Our needs are different. I am sure that  the Minister will insist that, when the Welfare Reform Bill comes back to us  and is applicable here, it will meet the needs of the people.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: I add  my thanks to Committee and departmental staff, and I also thank all our  stakeholders. Although I support the principles of the Bill in getting more  economically inactive people into work, I have concerns about many of its  aspects, as some sanctions appear to be very harsh. However, I accept the  Minister&rsquo;s assurance that the Department will maximise operational flexibility  and his view that there are many doubts as to whether the &ldquo;work for your  benefit&rdquo; scheme will materialise in Northern Ireland at all. Most  unemployed people want to work. However, health problems or a lack of  qualifications mean that they cannot get a job, and many of them have fallen  into the benefits trap. The focus must be on helping people to upskill so that  they can get meaningful jobs and get out of the poverty trap. It is wrong to  threaten them with sanctions or to wave big sticks over their heads.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We supported a number of Sinn F&eacute;in amendments, and we are  disappointed that those amendments have not been accepted. Amendment No 1  proposed a new clause to provide an overarching safeguard on the welfare of  children as the fundamental background to the Bill, and I supported it for  several reasons. First, we have the highest level of child poverty in the UK, and that is  unacceptable. OFMDFM highlighted the importance of families taking up benefits  to help them out of poverty; on the other hand, the Bill threatens to take  benefits away from families and threatens them with sanctions. That is  inconsistent with anti-poverty policies.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister highlighted the fact that we still do not have  a childcare strategy or accessible and affordable childcare here in Northern Ireland,  and he was very sympathetic about that. As the Minister said, when welfare  reform was developed in Great    Britain, it was done in conjunction with a  well-resourced childcare strategy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important that we take all those issues into account  when we consider the Bill. As it stands, the Bill has an awful lot of draconian  aspects, and I urge the Minister and his departmental staff to be very sympathetic  when implementing the legislation to ensure that we do not push the already  marginalised sections of our community further to the margin.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank Members for their contributions. I do not  intend to detain them long.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Craig raised questions about the timely manner in which  the Bill&rsquo;s processes were managed and handled. I am not over that issue, but I  will ask for advice from officials on it. It is important that the Committee  and the Department do not work hand in glove, because lines would get blurred  and crossed. Nonetheless, there should, in principle, be suitable liaison  between the Department and the Committee, given the burdens on the Committee  because of its oversight and consideration of various pieces of legislation. To  accommodate the differing needs of the Committee, I will certainly look at that  matter to see whether I can reach any proper conclusions about how the  legislation was handled.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I listened attentively to Mr Craig speaking in an  individual capacity about accelerated passage. Standing back from it &mdash; I have  come to this somewhat fresh &mdash; I feel that there are at least four or five  grounds for why the legislation should have been subject to the full  legislative process. First, there is an argument that accelerated passage is  not necessarily a practice that should, per se, be adopted routinely or  slavishly for welfare parity legislation &mdash; for want of a better term &mdash; or for  any type of legislation. The second reason it might have been appropriate for the  matter to be subject to some further scrutiny is, as Mr Craig said, that there  were misgivings about the legislation and that he, I and others find it  challenging. Mr Brady described the legislation as sanction-led, punitive, not  thought-out and not properly considered. Given that Members have those views on  the legislation, it seems neglectful to not give Assembly the opportunity to  explore that legislation properly.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I will let Mr Brady in in a moment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The third reason why full consideration of the legislation  is appropriate is that it is always useful to get reassurances on particular  legislation, including on operational flexibility, which is relevant to this  Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As Mr Craig indicated, if one element was most vital in the  passage of the legislation, it was the reassurances on good cause, childcare  and informed discretion. It will be useful for the Department, the Social  Security Agency, the Minister and the House for those matters to be scoped as  fully as possible at a particular time in order to give as full a reassurance  as possible as to how they might play out.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Before I give way to Mr Brady, the fourth reason that it  was appropriate to consider the matter fully is simply that an ongoing  discussion on welfare was taking place. We all knew that there was a  possibility of a Tory Government. We all knew that Iain Duncan Smith and his  organisation had ambitions and intentions on welfare reform. Therefore, it was  useful and timely to discuss the issues, explore parity considerations and have  a fuller conversation about what might be viewed as parity legislation. If we  did not do it over the past of number of months, it was vital that we do it  over the next number of months.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: I  thank the Minister for giving way. Parity is mentioned constantly. The  difficulty is that the Committee received briefings from departmental officials  who, with respect, had no say in or input into this legislation. It was simply  dumped on us whether we liked it or not, and that hindered proper questioning  on and discussion of the issues. The legislation is formulated and enacted in Britain, and we  are expected to sit down and accept it, even if it is punitive and prescriptive  here.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Childcare provision is one such issue, but, before I  finish, I also want to make a point about DLA. I have listened to radio  programmes all week about people getting DLA who should not be. DLA is the  benefit for which the least fraud is committed: 0&middot;01%. I wish that those who  speak about DLA fraud would check their facts. DLA is a very difficult benefit  to get, and as the Minister well knows, it is medically determined, and medical  evidence has to be provided in order to be entitled to it. Therefore, those who  speak about DLA fraud impugn many doctors, specialists and others in the Six  Counties who contribute to helping people receive DLA.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: Nothing that the Member said is inconsistent with the  four points that I made, but I will emphasise those points. Reassurances were  given during the debates at the Bill&rsquo;s various stages and in Committee that  disability rights organisations, for example, would be involved in preparing guidance.  Reassurances were also given that the Committee would be involved in  procurement.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">All those reassurances could be put on the record  elsewhere, but in order to understand how good cause could be applied in  particular circumstances, it would be useful to me as the Minister to grasp  fully where operational flexibility resides, how good cause is managed and how  people can be better trained. We may have to live with parity measures for some  time. However, it will be highly useful if, during debates on future welfare  reform Bills, we can scope, get reassurance and develop as fully and as  reasonably as possible how operational flexibility operates.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I agree with what the Member said about disability living  allowance, and I return to the point that I made. I have asked officials to use  a number of source documents to map out Northern Ireland and create a  matrix that explains our levels of DLA take-up more fully.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I believe, for all the reasons that I outlined earlier,  that a range of factors give rise to DLA applications and to the uptake rate in  the North. That exercise can give me an evidence base for my conversation with  Lord Freud; whether it has any impact on him is a different matter. However,  establishing a proper evidence base is important so that what he knows to be  the case and what I understand to be the case about the people who are entitled  to receive DLA and the good grounds on which they get it can be put on record  and beyond contradiction. Therefore, if London  authorities guide us in a certain way, that will give us the rebuttal arguments  that we need to say that they should not go in that way.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I acknowledge what Mr Craig said about the close scrutiny  of the Committee when it comes to the transfer of benefit claimants. Given the  number of people &mdash; 76,000 &mdash; who will be affected by proposals for migration  from income support, that is a very healthy and important piece of work. I know  that officials will give evidence to the Committee tomorrow on how migration is  being planned and implemented.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Yesterday, senior officials and I met a group of women from  Derry to discuss how the benefits system is  working for people who have been affected by cancer. One consequence of that  meeting was that a group of women who have been personally or otherwise  affected by cancer and who have issues with the benefits system and how it is  managed opened up a direct line of communication with senior officials on the  benefits side in order to get matters addressed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That meeting gave rise to examples of practice that was not  the best, if I can put it that way. That will, in all likelihood, lead to my  having a conversation with the president of the appeals tribunal in respect of  questions that may be open to interpretation. For example, women who are  applying for DLA because of cancer or cancer medication are asked questions  that, in their minds, reflect on their capacity and competence as parents.  People who are conducting appeals tribunals need to be mindful that the  questions that they ask about DLA entitlement can make people who are in a  difficult situation wonder whether they are being asked about their competence  as a parent, which is utterly irrelevant.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, I, as Minister, and the Committee must keep an  eye on how the benefits system is working so that issues are properly managed.  That is why I welcome what Jonathan Craig said about the Committee&rsquo;s commitment  to scrutinise closely the transfer of benefit claimants. I can give the  reassurance that I will be on a parallel path.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Brady confirmed that it was my intention to do 30  months&rsquo; work in 10 months. I am tempted to say that I would be doing a bit  better than a lot of other Ministers who have done 10 months&rsquo; work in 30  months, but I will not go down that particular road.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As Members know, I hold a strong view that Ministers who go  into government go into power. I have a view that, in this mandate and in the  first mandate, there was too much of one and too little of the other. Members  can work that out for themselves.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not necessarily agree with the language that Mr Brady  used, but I do not dissent from the sentiment that he and many other Members  expressed. Whether the words used were &ldquo;challenging&rdquo;, &ldquo;misgiving&rdquo;, &ldquo;sanctions&rdquo;  or &ldquo;punitive&rdquo;, they capture the flavour of those matters. In responding to my  comments during a previous debate, Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n acknowledged that, as  Minister, I was on the same page as many others. I will find that quotation  before I conclude, Mr Deputy Speaker.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have personal reservations about a lot of this  legislation, but I have a ministerial responsibility to people in the North,  and there is a difference. In trying to map my way through this issue, that has  guided me. My personal reservations about a number of clauses are deep and  substantial to the point where I would agree with words such as &ldquo;misgiving&rdquo; and  &ldquo;punitive&rdquo;. Nonetheless, as a Minister, it is my job to think beyond my  personal inclinations and consider what is in the best interest of people who  are subject to the benefits system.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If there are any other matters that I have not addressed, I  will certainly come back to them. I wish to correct two matters. According to  my officials, Mr Brady &mdash; this may have been a slip of the tongue, so I will not  make it a point &mdash; said that parents with children as young as one would have to  look for work. Over and above the issue of childcare, which we have fully  explored, no parent of a child under one has to do anything. A parent of a  child who is between two and three years old has to attend only work-focused  interviews, and those would happen, at most, every quarter. Parents with  children who are between three and six years old may have to do work-related  activity, subject to all the caveats that are already on the record.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome what Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n said in reply to the debate at  the Bill&rsquo;s Consideration Stage. As regards some comments made previously, she  said:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;In fairness to the Minister, I note that he took a  different approach to the issue. The impression that I get &mdash; I am not asking  him to confirm it, even though I am really tempted to &mdash; is that, if he was  convinced that stretching matters and breaking parity on the issue would not  affect a subvention, he might actually go with it. That is the sense that I  got.&rdquo; &mdash; [Official Report, Vol 53, No 1, p74, col 2].</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That probably accurately and fairly reflects my  views. Of course that view was contradicted a few days later when Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n  said in a statement:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The SDLP Minister, Alex Attwood, may be content with  regulating sanctions, Sinn F&eacute;in are not. Fundamentally, we should not be  punishing those who find themselves out of work for perfectly legitimate  reasons. The other parties, and the SDLP in particular, have very serious  questions to answer about why they are bringing forward legislation that will  attack the weakest within our society, and nowhere is this more stark than in  areas of high deprivation such as North Belfast.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I find those sorts of comments unnecessary. A Member  should say one thing on the Floor of the House and then say it to the public,  or he or she should say nothing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">During the various debates on this legislation, I went out  of my way to say that I understood the sentiment behind amendments and that  they were not mischievous, even though they might create mischief with the  operation of the benefits system in the North. I tried to hear, listen and  respond to what people said, but, being mindful of wider political and parity  issues, I am somewhat constrained. I find it simply disingenuous to be told to  my face in this House that others think that I would like to stretch parity in  a way that would not affect a subvention and, a couple of days later, to be  told that I am regulating sanctions. That is simply not the case.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>:  With respect, Minister, I think that you should take the compliments when you  get them and the criticism when you get it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I am thick-skinned and have been in politics long  enough to take all of that. However, if we are to have a serious, balanced  conversation about parity and about stretching and changing parity, then, in my  view, the one thing that you do not do in the North is play politics with  people in need who are entitled to the benefits. Therefore, I will take the  compliment, but I will note the criticism, because you are playing both sides  of the fence, and that ill serves people who need all Members to be on the  right side of the fence.</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">Question put and agreed to.</p>

    <p class="H4StageHeading">Reavey Family Murders, January 1976</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I remind Members that the proposer of the topic will have 15  minutes in which to speak. All other Members will have approximately eight  minutes.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Choiste  Gn&oacute; as an am a thabhairt domh a bheith p&aacute;irteach sa d&iacute;osp&oacute;ireacht seo. I thank  the Business Committee for providing the time for the Assembly to debate this  important issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">John Martin Reavey, aged 24, and his brother Brian, aged  22, were murdered in their home on 4 January 1976. Gunmen broke into their home  near Whitecross and sprayed the living room with bullets, killing John Martin  instantly. Brian tried to escape. However, he made it only to the bedroom door  before he, too, was murdered.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Anthony Reavey, who was 17 years old, threw himself under a  bed for protection, but was shot and left for dead. Seriously wounded, he  managed to crawl from the house to try to raise the alarm at a neighbour&rsquo;s  house. Having survived for some weeks, Anthony later died.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I know the Reavey family well. I am aware that other  Members of the House also know the family. They are a highly respected family  in south Armagh. When that dreadful deed  happened, no one in the locality could understand why the family had been  targeted and attacked.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On the same night, another Catholic family, the O&rsquo;Dowd  family, who lived at Ballydugan near Gilford, was also attacked. Three members  of that family were murdered. They were Joseph O&rsquo;Dowd, aged 61, and his two  nephews Barry, aged 24, and Declan, aged 19. Barney O&rsquo;Dowd, the father of the  two boys, was seriously injured. As it happens, all of them were SDLP members.  They are related to Mr O&rsquo;Dowd, Member for Upper Bann.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A group comprising loyalist paramilitaries who acted in  collusion with members of the police force, the RUC Reserve and the UDR, known  as the Glenanne gang, was responsible for at least 18 gun and bomb attacks, in  which 58 people were murdered. That group had its headquarters in the farm of  James Mitchell, who is now deceased, which was situated just outside the village of Glenanne, around two miles from where  the Reavey family lived. One of the gang&rsquo;s members, former RUC sergeant John  Weir, confessed to his part in its activities and exposed the gang&rsquo;s members. I  have already dealt in detail with the activities, victims and membership of  that gang in a previous speech that I made in the House on 24 May 2010. The  gang was responsible for the murder of the Reavey brothers, the O&rsquo;Dowds, and  many others.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On the day following his sons&rsquo; murders, their father Mr  Jimmy Reavey appealed that there be no retaliation for his sons&rsquo; deaths.  Unfortunately, that appeal fell on deaf ears. That night, the murders  continued. Ten Protestant workers, who were on their way home in the mill  works&rsquo; minibus, were murdered by a group that called itself the South Armagh  Republican Action Force. The bus was stopped by a group of armed men who were  dressed in camouflage jackets. Richard Hughes, who was the only Catholic on the  bus, was picked out of the group and told to run up the road.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Many of his fellow workers, with the murders of the  Reaveys from the previous night in mind, thought that he was to be the victim  and tried to shield him. Richard was spared, because of his religion. His  fellow workers were sprayed with bullets until all except one lay dead on the  road. Alan Black from Bessbrook was the only one to survive.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I knew most of those who were murdered that night. They  were from my native village   of Bessbrook; I played  football with some of them in the pond field. They were ordinary working-class  people returning home after doing a day&rsquo;s work. I also played football with  members of the Reavey family. Brian Reavey was a student at the same school  that I attended, St Paul&rsquo;s  in Bessbrook, where he was renowned as the top sportsman of his year group. His  younger brother Anthony was also a talented footballer. Those young people had  many things in common.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When the Kingsmill massacre was taking place, the Reavey  family were on their way to Daisy   Hill Hospital  in Newry to bring home the remains of their murdered brothers. They came across  the scene of the massacre at Kingsmill, and one of the surviving brothers  helped to divert traffic from that terrible scene. On reaching the hospital,  Eugene Reavey, in the midst of his grief, did what any decent person would do:  he went to the room in which the relatives of the Kingsmill victims had  gathered, introduced himself and offered the condolences of his family to the  victims.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Anthony Reavey became friends with Alan Black, who was one  of the two survivors of the Kingsmill massacre, when both were in hospital  recovering from their wounds. Alan was broken-hearted when he heard that  Anthony Reavey had died on 30 January 1976. The original verdict at his inquest  was one of death by natural causes, but that was later changed to an open  verdict.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There was no real investigation of the Reavey murders, and  the family was left to try to come to terms with the murders without any help  whatsoever from those in authority. That was the case until Commander Dave Cox  of the Historical Enquiries Team (HET) investigated the murders. Difficult as  it was to come to terms with the murders, it was made even more difficult by a  statement that was made by a Member of this House, Dr Paisley, in another place  on 27 January 1999. He said:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;It is interesting to note that a police dossier  carefully prepared on the Kingsmill massacre has recently come to light.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Dr Paisley continued:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;According to the dossier, Eugene Reavey, a well-known  republican, &lsquo;set up the Kingsmill massacre&rsquo;&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Reavey family have been victims of collusion, not once,  but twice: first, when three members of the family were murdered by the UVF,  acting in collusion with elements of the security forces; and, secondly, nearly  a quarter of a century later, when the name of one of the surviving brothers,  Eugene, was blackened under the shield of parliamentary privilege. None of  those accusations was true. Former RUC Chief Constable Ronnie Flanagan said  that no police file contained any such allegation. Immediately upon hearing  that report, the sole survivor of the Kingsmill massacre, Alan Black, phoned  Eugene Reavey&rsquo;s home and told him that he knew that what Dr Paisley had said  could not be true.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">More recently, the HET has stated definitively that neither  Eugene Reavey, his murdered brothers, nor any member of his family had any  connections with any paramilitary grouping or crime. Therefore, one must ask  why Dr Paisley said what he said. Where did the supposed dossier come from? Who  would have a motive to create it and plant it on a gullible MP? Dr Paisley did  not question the provenance of the dossier, so he must have believed that it  came from an authoritative police source, of which he has utilised many over  his long political career.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Therefore, decades after the actual collusion, it seems  that well-placed persons were still in action, covering up crimes and spreading  lies and malicious slander that were based on tittle-tattle in an attempt to  justify organised, systematic sectarian murder on a large scale.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Reavey family are as satisfied as people in their  circumstances can be with what the Historical Enquiries Team has done. However,  one thing still rankles with them: the false allegation that Dr Paisley made  against their brother Eugene. They would like to see that slur removed in their  now 88-year-old mother&rsquo;s lifetime. It is not too much to ask. Eugene Reavey has  written to Dr Paisley on several occasions, but he has received no reply. Dr  Paisley is aware of the situation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Reavey family want no recompense other than to see the  record set straight and their brother&rsquo;s name cleared. It is within Dr Paisley&rsquo;s  gift to respond positively to the request from an 88-year-old mother and  grandmother and her surviving sons and daughters, whether that is done in a  face-to-face private meeting, in the House of Lords when he takes his seat  there, or by whatever means with which Dr Paisley feels most comfortable. Ian  Paisley is known as &ldquo;The Big Man&rdquo;. He now has the opportunity to show that he is  big, not just in stature but in heart and mind. I hope that, for the sake of  Sadie Reavey, he takes that opportunity.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Many people died in south Armagh  during the Troubles, and I want to remember them all here today, from whatever  background they came. I hope sincerely that their loved ones get the truth that  they deserve. I ask the House to join me in that sentiment and to recognise the  innocence of the murdered Reavey brothers and the whole Reavey family. I ask  the House to join me in urging Dr Paisley to do the right thing by the Reavey  family. Perhaps, too, the Chief Constable, Mr Baggott, could take time out of  his busy schedule to visit Mrs Reavey and apologise in person on behalf of the  police.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am glad to welcome members of the Reavey family who have  come here today to hear this debate. I trust that other Members who participate  in the debate will do so in the spirit in which I have entered into it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I apologise on behalf of Conor  Murphy, the MP and an MLA for Newry and Armagh,  who cannot be here because of another engagement. I thank Dominic Bradley for  securing the debate, and I welcome the opportunity to speak on the matter. I  got to know the Reavey family through my previous job, and I got the  opportunity to work with and know people in the communities in Whitecross,  Drumnahunshin, Greyhillan and Glenanne. Those people treated me well, and I  want to put my appreciation for that on record.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also want to put on record that the three members of the  Reavey family &mdash; John Martin, Brian and Anthony &mdash; who were gunned down in cold  blood at Greyhillan, Whitecross on 4 January 1976, were completely innocent.  They were ordinary people who became victims of collusion that was carried out  by members of the RUC, UDR, UVF and British intelligence. Part of that group  became known as the notorious Glenanne gang.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not propose to repeat everything that Dominic Bradley  said. Instead, I want to concentrate on the broader picture, which is closely  linked to the murders of members of the Reavey family in Whitecross.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The murders of the Reavey family were not carried  out in isolation. That notorious gang carried out a number of atrocities, and I  would like to speak, if I may, on some of those incidents, such as the bomb at  the Step Inn Bar in Keady, the shooting at the Rock Bar in Granemore outside  Keady and the attacks on Donnelly&rsquo;s Bar in Silverbridge and Tully&rsquo;s Bar in  Belleeks.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to put it on record that I had the privilege as a  young boy of working as a paper boy for the McGleenan family, who owned a paper  shop. One of their sons was killed in the Step Inn bomb. On the evening of  Monday 16 August 1976, a no-warning bomb exploded outside the Step Inn in St Patrick Street  in Keady, which is commonly known as Chapel    Street. There were 15 to 20 people in the bar at  that time. A blue Ford Cortina hijacked three days earlier from the Shankill Road had  been packed with more than 200 lb of explosives and was parked against the  gable wall of the bar.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to put those events in context so that Members can  understand. Paddy McGleenan&rsquo;s son and James McDonald&rsquo;s wife were killed in that  attack. Those two men would have walked around and checked the streets for  suspicious cars. The car that was stolen on the Shankill Road had been fitted with Armagh plates, so no remarks would have been passed on  it. The bar owner, James McDonald, told the inquest that he had also noticed  that street lights in Chapel Street had been turned off when he left the bar.  It was common practice in those days for the lights &mdash;</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. The Member is straying way off the topic of the debate. I  ask him to return to the substance of the debate, which is the murder of the  Reavey brothers.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>: I  was just setting the context so that Members have a clear understanding, but I  take your point, Mr Deputy Speaker. Betty McDonald, who was 32 years old and  the mother of three young children, was in the bar when the bomb exploded. Her  husband found her lying behind the bar after the explosion with their youngest  child standing over her, crying. Gerald McGleenan, who was 22 years old, was  standing outside his home opposite the Step Inn in Chapel Street when the bomb exploded. He  was hit by shrapnel and died within minutes. A keen hurler, he had played in  the county senior final the week before his death. Members of the team were  pallbearers at his funeral.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Some 22 other people were injured in the blast, including a  pregnant woman. Her unborn baby survived uninjured, only to be shot dead &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. I have to remind the Member to come back to the substance  of the debate. I know that you are trying to put the debate into context, but  the matter that is being debated is the murder of the Reavey brothers. I ask  the Member to take that into consideration.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>:  With your indulgence, Mr Deputy Speaker, I am trying to set that murder in  context because it did not happen in isolation. I said that at the very start.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  When the Member is putting things in context, will he acknowledge the complete  context of murders in Northern    Ireland, some of which his party and members  of his party committed? If we are to stray off the topic for debate, which is  the murder of the Reavey family, perhaps the Member will focus on the murders  that some of his comrades conducted.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>: I  am putting in context exactly what happened at the time. The murder of the  Reaveys did not happen in isolation; it was joined together with operations  carried out perhaps over a 12-month period. That is what I want to talk about  today, because I am well aware &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. I understand what the Member is saying, but the substance  of the debate is the murder of the Reavey brothers; therefore, the main part of  a speech should be about that. If the Member wishes to talk about the entire  context of that period, he is at liberty to table a motion for debate in the  House at another time.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>:  Thank you very much for that guidance. I am just speaking about what happened at  Greyhillan, Whitecross. There is a connection between what happened to the  Reavey brothers in Whitecross and other incidents in south Armagh  in that year. I want to put into context some of the cases where some of the  weapons that were used in the murder of the Reaveys were also used in the  murder and attempted murder of other people in south Armagh.  Look at the unfortunate incident of two GAA supporters shot dead in  Altnamackan, coming home from Dublin.  It was proved that the 9 mm Luger that was used in the double murder had been  used in other incidents. That is why I have to put what happened at that time  into context. I referred to the bombing of the Step Inn because this gang was  all part of that. We cannot deny what happened at that time.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It started in December 1975 in Donnelly&rsquo;s in Silverbridge.  Unfortunately, the Reavey brothers were then killed in January 1976, and it  continued for six months. It is clearly stated in the records and reports that  the same weapons were used in a number of those incidents. That is why I wanted  to bring that up today. The weapons that were used on the Reaveys were also  used in the attack on the Rock Bar in Granemore, when Michael McGrath was shot  in the stomach. The same weapons were shown to be used and the same people involved  as in the crimes committed against the Reaveys in Whitecross. That is why I am  bringing that up today. I want Members to recognise that. There was an  attempted murder in the Rock Bar in Granemore in June 1976, as well.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is strong evidence that those attacks were carried  out by what became known as the infamous Glenanne gang, which &mdash; whether or not  people like to recognise it &mdash; was state-sponsored and state-led terrorism. The  gang was a consortium of UDR, RUC and UVF personnel supported by military and  British intelligence. It is due to the involvement of state bodies that the  murders of the Reavey brothers and many other people, some of whom I have  spoken about today, have never been resolved. That has blackened not only the  characters of some of those families and some of the people in that area but  the area itself.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In a debate earlier today, some Member was encouraging us  to go to Dungannon and talking about the civic reception and civic issues and  about what they were doing in Dungannon. I want to put south Armagh  in that context, because the character of that area has been blackened, and  that is not right. Atrocities have happened on both sides, and my party has  stood up and said that it is willing to move forward and to work together on  that issue. However, Members must recognise exactly what happened during that  time, and I tried to set that in context. I will finish by saying that that  situation must change.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member should draw his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>: I  hope that the families and people of south Armagh,  some of whom are in the Public Gallery today, find out the truth, receive an  apology and get the recognition that they deserve.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  Clearly, very strong emotions are attached to the issue. I recognise Mr  Bradley&rsquo;s right to table this topic for Adjournment debate. Unfortunately, Mr  Boylan&rsquo;s contribution has not helped to deal with many of the issues involved.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  I thank the Member for giving way. He referred to the contribution of Mr  Boylan, who suggested that the people concerned should get the apology that  they are due. I have no problem with that. However, does the Member agree with  me that Sinn F&eacute;in should also apologise for the cowardly murders that it  carried out in the same period?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. The political party of which I am proud  to be a member has not been responsible for the murder of anyone. I can  understand that there are strong emotions in the Chamber, as Mr Kennedy said.  However, we must not let the debate degenerate into a slanging match.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member is quite right, and I thank him for that point of  order. Sinn F&eacute;in is a political party and was not responsible for any murders  in itself.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  I accept that ruling, Mr Deputy Speaker. I should have said, &ldquo;the members of  Sinn F&eacute;in who were convicted of murder&rdquo;. Does the Member agree with the point  that I have just made?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  The Member makes an important point, and I hope to address the issues involved  as I progress with my speech.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The early and mid-1970s were a truly dreadful time in the  south Armagh area and, more particularly, in  Whitecross and Newtownhamilton. It involved the murders of security force  personnel and ordinary individuals who were caught up in a cycle that was  mostly tit-for-tat deaths. The murders created an atmosphere of fear and  distrust that stalked the region, and the consequences were severe. Lives were  taken, lives were broken, and lives were changed for ever. In the south Armagh area, which I am proud to represent, we live and  deal with that legacy today. Therefore, I do not want the debate to descend  into a tribal jamboree of blame, counterblame and &ldquo;whataboutery&rdquo;. However, it  is important to put into context some of the events that all of us struggle to  come to terms with and make sense of. None of those events should have  happened.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is my belief that the three Reavey brothers, Brian, John  Martin and Anthony, who died some weeks later, were murdered in a very cruel  and callous manner and were entirely innocent victims. I place that on record  and have no doubt of that in my mind. On the same evening, just outside  Gilford, members of the O&rsquo;Dowd family were also murdered in the cycle of  tit-for-tat deaths that was so common throughout County  Armagh and other places in Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">From the early to mid-70s, particularly in the  Whitecross/Newtownhamilton area, there was a series of murders, particularly of  security force personnel, atrocities such as the murder of five Orangemen at  Tullyvallen Orange Hall on 1 September 1975 and individual murders. Today, we  heard allegations about who was responsible for those. It is alleged by some,  as was repeated today in the Chamber, that members of the security forces were  involved in that collusion. However, it is my belief that no substantial proof  has been provided to justify those remarks.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We also heard about politicians&rsquo; intemperate remarks. I  draw to the attention of the House the remarks made by a former deputy First  Minister, S&eacute;amus Mallon, who, after the murder of two individuals returning  from a GAA match in the Republic   of Ireland, said that  loyalist assassins were operating within the UDR in Newtownhamilton. That was a  highly provocative statement that has caused great offence down through the  years and continues to do so. All politicians have a responsibility to remember  that what we say, how we behave and how we react can have significant  influence.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We already heard from Mr Bradley about the Kingsmill  massacre, which is close to my heart, given that I knew nine of the individuals  and their families and continue to try to assist those who were caught up in  that massacre. That had a profound effect on the village of Bessbrook  and the wider area, which is still felt to this day. I say again that none of  that should have happened.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">This debate revolves around a single event, when three  innocent people were gunned down in cold blood. That event was not justified by  anything, but neither was it isolated. Within 24 hours, 16 people died who  should not have died. The previous year, 207 people died who should not have  died; and 300 other people were to die in 1976 following the events of January  1976. None of that should have happened.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I live in the area of those deaths. I was a teenager at the  time, and I know the effect that they had on myself and my community. I now  live some three miles from the original Reavey home and, therefore, even less  distance from the scene of the Kingsmill massacre. I travel on that road very  often, and I always, always reflect on the events of January 1976 and the  fearful consequences with which so many families have had to deal.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The critical thing is that none of it should have happened.  We have, of course, real concerns that, if we are asked to provide inquiries  similar to the Saville Inquiry, it will simply create a hierarchy of deaths as  we look back. Everyone in Northern    Ireland wants to try to look forward, yet to  remember the mistakes of the past and to be sure to take account and take care  of the victims. Therefore, as we study those complex issues and pay attention  to those so badly affected and although we should acknowledge the past, it is  time for us to strive to move forward and create the better and shared future  that all our people need and deserve.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I, too, welcome the debate secured by  Mr Bradley. I also welcome members of the Reavey family here today.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have to keep it in mind that we are talking about the  brutal murder of innocent people. As someone from Newry and not that far from  Whitecross when it happened, I remember the aftermath vividly. Mr Kennedy  alluded to the Kingsmill massacre. I, too, knew people who were killed and  murdered in that. I knew the Chapman brothers through football and darts, and I  know Alan Black, who fortunately survived, even though he was shot 18 times.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Recompense has been mentioned. I know Mrs Reavey well. As  has been said, she is 88 years of age. She reared a family that was extremely  respectable, well-got and popular in our area. I went to school with Eugene  Reavey, albeit a couple of years behind him, and I am sure that he will not  mind me saying that. It was a family that was never, to anyone&rsquo;s knowledge,  involved in anything nefarious, as has been alleged. Allegations were made  against Eugene  in particular.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The family wants justice in the sense of real justice. They  simply want the record put straight. The Glenanne gang was alluded to, and its  activities are well documented. Other Members spoke about murders by other  groups. What we are talking about here is murder by people who were entrusted  with upholding the law. Therein lies the difference. We are constantly berated  in this Chamber by Members talking about the upholders of the law and the  people who stood in the front line against terrorism and all the rest of it.  Sometimes, people need to stand up and put their hands up and say, &ldquo;Yes, that  happened; it did happen&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Reavey family is not looking for anything but an  admission. Indeed, the Historical Enquiries Team, as Dominic Bradley alluded  to, has accepted fully that the Reavey brothers were innocent. Everybody in  Newry and the surrounding area of south Armagh  knew that the Reavey brothers were innocent, as, indeed, were the O&rsquo;Dowds and  the other people murdered in Donnelly&rsquo;s bar at Silverbridge and the people at  Kingsmill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">All that anyone is asking is for that to be put in  context.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I agree with Mr Kennedy that these things should not have  happened, but the fact is that they did. We need to move on, but there are  families such as the Reaveys who have to live with this every single day.  Eugene Reavey&rsquo;s name has been blackened, and all that he wants is a simple  apology. I see no problem with that. Dr Paisley rose in the British Parliament,  using parliamentary privilege, and cast scurrilous allegations against Eugene  Reavey. It is time that that was put to rest. Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. The date of 4 January is marked  indelibly on my mind. As a young lad of eight and a half years, I remember  sitting on a Sunday evening watching television with my family. As in many  rural homes, the whole family had packed into the room to watch the Sunday  evening film. A knock came at the door. Even at that young age, we were under  strict instructions not to open the front door unless we knew who was there. I  looked out through the window to our yard where I saw a number of my cousins standing  in what, even to me at that young age, was recognisable as a distressed state.  I opened the door and my next memories are of my mother and father crying for  the first time that I can remember at the news of the deaths of my cousin  Barry, 24; Declan, 18; and my uncle Joe, who was in his 60s.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At that age, all those things do not immediately sink in  but, as the night wore on, I became aware that another family had been visited  by the same heartache and horror: the Reaveys. There is a connection with any family  that loses a loved one: the horror, the pain and all that goes with it. I know  that Members opposite have lost loved ones in similarly horrible circumstances.  Their pain is no different from any other family&rsquo;s, whether we are talking  about innocent civilians, republican activists or members of one of the British  services who lost their lives during the conflict. The pain to a family member  is no different.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The connection between the Reaveys and the O&rsquo;Dowds is that  the same gang carried out the killings. I can understand Mr Kennedy&rsquo;s defence  of members of the Ulster Defence Regiment, and I accept that many people joined  the Ulster Defence Regiment because they believed that they were doing the  right thing. In their minds, they were serving all sections of the community.  However, it is undeniable &mdash; beyond undeniable &mdash; that senior members of the  Glenanne gang were also members of the Ulster Defence Regiment, the RUC and  British military intelligence. To deny that does not serve the memory of  anyone, whether they be former members of the British forces who believed that  they were serving honourably and doing the right thing, or the victims of that  gang.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  Does the Member accept that it is comparatively easy to make allegations  without producing serious and credible evidence and that a great many families  whose relatives served in the security forces will feel deeply offended by  statements made not only in the course of this debate but in the past, and that  some account should be given to substantiate some of the allegations that have  been made?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>: I  do not wish to cause offence to anyone&rsquo;s family, but there is evidence. The  Barron Inquiry, a thorough investigation of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, showed that  they were carried out by the Glenanne gang. That inquiry identified members of  the gang as members of the British Army, the RUC, the UDR and British  intelligence agencies. We have a statement from a former member of the gang who  was a sergeant in the RUC. A Mr McCaughey was both a member of the gang and a  member of the RUC. I do not say that to offend people who have lost loved ones  or anyone else; I say it because the truth needs to be told.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Why did Dr Paisley stand up in the British House of Commons  and make those allegations against Eugene Reavey? It is well known that Mr  Reavey is not a prominent republican, nor a republican in the sense that was  presented to the British Parliament.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Why blacken Eugene Reavey&rsquo;s name? Was it an attempt to  divert attention away from the growing media and political interest in exactly  what the Glenanne gang was about? Who was the motivating force behind the  Glenanne gang and the atrocities that it carried out in south Armagh?  Was that why such a prominent politician as Dr Paisley stood up in Westminster and read out  a statement which was factually incorrect and had no basis in reality  whatsoever? Perhaps Mr Paisley believed it at the time. Mr Bradley said that  the information was given to Mr Paisley, in his terms, by a reliable source.  However, surely Mr Paisley cannot stand over it now.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is no basis to the allegations made against Eugene  Reavey or the Reavey family. It not only reflects on the Reavey family and on  my relatives who were killed that night, but casts murkiness over that whole  episode. Neither does it do any justice to those people who were gunned down  mercilessly at Kingsmill. The families of the people murdered at Kingsmill  deserve to know the truth about the people who lined them up against a bus and  shot them dead that night. If allegations are being made against Eugene Reavey,  or anyone else, that are untrue, it does not assist the quest for truth for the  families of the Kingsmill victims either.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I remember sitting in my mother&rsquo;s sister&rsquo;s house near  Lurgan the following night, when the news of the Kingsmill massacre came  through. The same horror that I witnessed the night before in my family home  was witnessed in that home as well, because people were appalled at what had  happened. I join the call for Dr Paisley to withdraw the comments he made about  Eugene Reavey in order to allow Mrs Reavey, in her last years, to know that her  family has been completely vindicated, and to set the record straight.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Kennedy said that we cannot go through the expensive  processes of Saville, etc. The Saville report would never have been necessary  if the truth had not been hidden. If we just let the truth about many of those  things out, there will be no need to go down the road of Saville. Give families  such as the Reaveys the truth around the circumstances in which their loved  ones were killed. The Reaveys and the O&rsquo;Dowd family were killed to strike  terror into the Catholic community.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Just let me finish this point.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Kingsmill victims were killed to strike terror into the  Protestant community. The circumstances around all those killings were wrong  and the killings of individuals were wrong.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I am grateful to the Member for giving way. How does he think that we can achieve  truth for the families of the Kingsmill victims?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  It is not up to me to dictate what the Kingsmill families want. They may want  continuing custodial justice around those sorts of things. I believe that a  fully independent, international truth inquiry would allow families such as  those of the victims of Kingsmill, and other families who have never had the  full truth around the death of their loved ones, to have the truth delivered to  them. I am not saying that that is all that the Kingsmill families deserve. It  is up to the Kingsmill families to decide what level they want to go to.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The reason why I support the peace process and will stand  against those people who are trying to drag us into the past is that, as a  young boy, I buried my neighbours and my friends, like so many other people  did. I am not going back there. I am not letting anyone else drag us back into  that society, because we all deserve better.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Under Standing Orders, an Adjournment debate is to last for one  hour. We have already had 45 minutes, and I have to allow 10 minutes for the  Minister of Justice to respond. I therefore call Mr Alban Maginness to speak  for five minutes.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  I apologise for not being here earlier, but I had other duties to attend to. I  followed a large part of the debate on a monitor.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are three points to be made. The first is that there  is unequivocal recognition in the House of the innocence of the Reavey brothers  and family. I think that that is of great comfort to the family. The fact that  the Assembly says that without equivocation is very important to the family. The  general recognition that this House has given to the Reavey brothers&rsquo; innocence  is very important; it is a significant decision on the part of the House.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">5.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although everyone that we are talking about was a victim of  terrorism and, in particular, of sectarian and counter-sectarian violence, it  has to be said that the slur on Eugene Reavey occasioned by Dr Paisley speaking  in the House of Commons and associating him with the Kingsmill massacre hurt  very deeply. It behoves all of us in this House to encourage Dr Paisley &mdash; who  has made hard political decisions that nobody would have countenanced in his  political life &mdash; who is big in stature, personality and persona to become an  even bigger man by admitting to his error in so describing Mr Reavey in the  House of Commons. This House should urge him to resile from what he said in the  House of Commons. That would go a long way towards reconciling the Reavey  family, particularly Mr Reavey and his mother, who, I think, would gracefully  accept such a retraction.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I take issue with what Mr Kennedy said about Seamus Mallon.  Seamus Mallon spoke with knowledge about what had occurred. There is no  equivalence between what was said by Mr Mallon and by Mr Paisley, and there  should be no attempt to make their statements equivalent. Mr Mallon expressed  views that were widely held in the community. Indeed, the activities of the  Glenanne gang have been well documented; the gang included a former RUC  sergeant who confessed to his part in its activities and who exposed other gang  members. There is no doubt that what Mr Mallon suggested was proven to be  correct. If there is any doubt, further investigation should take place, and if  an inquiry is needed, let us have one to clear the matter up. However,  collusion in the murder of the Reaveys is, in my view, demonstrably clear. A  sad, sad aspect of those murders is that people who should have been dedicated  to the rule of law and order betrayed the trust that the community had given  them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">This debate is important because it allows the Reavey  family and the community at large to recognise that people care for them, for  their reputation and for the fact that the family has suffered grievously, not  just through physical injury and death but also through damage to their  reputation. However, today, their reputation has been restored.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice (Mr Ford)</strong>: I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate  and congratulate Dominic Bradley on securing it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I met Eugene Reavey in May of this year, when he raised  with me the findings of the Historical Enquiries Team. It was absolutely clear  that, 34 years on, the pain of the loss of his brothers remains very real for  him and for his family. Therefore, first, I would like to express publicly, as  I have already expressed privately, my sympathy for him and his wider family  circle on the loss of his three brothers: John Martin, Brian and Anthony.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As other Members, Mr Bradley and Mr Kennedy in particular,  said, 4 and 5 January 1976 were two of the most tragic days in the history of  the Troubles, with the murder of three Reavey brothers, the murder of three  members of the O&rsquo;Dowd family and, the following day, the terrible events at  Kingsmill, where 10 workers were singled out on their way home from work and  gunned down.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When I met Eugene Reavey, I was not aware of the contents  of the review summary report that the Historical Enquiries Team had prepared  for him and his family. That is because the HET&rsquo;s commitment is to the families  of the victims of the Troubles. No one is entitled to see an HET report without  the prior approval of the family concerned. At that meeting, Mr Reavey gave  approval for me to be given a copy, which is why I am able to speak about it  today.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Let us remember that we are discussing only one of 782  cases, involving 1,007 victims, that have been completed so far by the HET. It  was established in 2005 and is tasked with reviewing all 3,261 deaths that  occurred as a result of the Troubles between 1968 and 1998. It has the two-fold  aim of striving to bring a measure of resolution to families and ensuring that  all investigative and evidential opportunities are subject to thorough and  exhaustive examination.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Every one of the deaths that occurred during the Troubles  is a tragedy. Each case is also unique, and families will have markedly  different views and perspectives and different questions and issues of concern.  As I said, the HET approach is family centred. In the review of the murder of  the Reavey brothers, it attempted to answer more than 30 questions from family  members. To carry out that work effectively, the HET developed a five-phase  process that includes the collection, assessment and review of all relevant  material, followed by a focused reinvestigation and resolution. In this review,  as in all others, the HET accessed witness statements, forensic reports, the  original police case papers and intelligence information.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In summary, the HET reached the following conclusions about  the murder of John Martin, Brian and Anthony Reavey: the Reavey family was well  respected in the local community; the attack happened at a time of spiralling  sectarian violence in south Armagh; and there was no evidence, nor were there  any evidential opportunities, that could bring about the identification or  prosecution of those responsible. The inquiry found that John Martin, Brian and  Anthony Reavey were entirely innocent victims who had no criminal convictions  or links to any paramilitary group.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As the Minister of Justice elected in 2010, I have no  responsibility for the events of 1976. However, I repeat the conclusions of the  HET: the three Reavey brothers, John Martin, Brian and Anthony, were entirely  innocent victims who had no criminal convictions or links to any paramilitary  group. I particularly welcome the fact that Danny Kennedy, as a unionist  representative of that area, acknowledged that this afternoon.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Justice</strong>: The report further stated that no member of the Reavey family had  any verified links to any paramilitary group, which is contrary to later  speculation. I know, from the meeting in May, about the particular hurt that  has been caused to Eugene Reavey by the repetition of that speculation. This  afternoon, Mr Bradley and other Members referred to the feelings of Mr Reavey&rsquo;s  mother. We all wish those feelings to be taken into account.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The HET report also states that there are sufficient accounts  from the Reavey family members and from independent observers to evidence the  harassment that the family endured from some members of the security forces  after those terrible murders. They were the subject of disinformation, rumour  and innuendo, which caused them great distress for many years. That issue has  been well aired this afternoon.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Northern    Ireland has moved a long way from the dark  days of the Troubles. For most of us, those days are memories, and, for younger  members of society, they are history. However, there is no doubt that some of  those who suffered directly still suffer to this day.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The report, I believe, underlines the positive role that  the HET is playing in providing a measure of resolution to families who lost  loved ones during the Troubles. It pledges to deal with families with honesty,  trust and confidentiality and to carry out its work with great sensitivity and  professionalism. Its commitment to families has resulted in its seeking to  answer more than 6,200 questions raised by families seeking answers about the  death of their loved ones.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">An independent survey carried out last year, and which will  be repeated this year, found that 95% of families who engaged with the HET  viewed it as professional; 86% were at least satisfied with its performance;  while only 5% were dissatisfied. That has also been recognised internationally.  The secretariat to the Committee of Ministers in the European Court of Human  Rights (ECHR) believes that the HET can be considered as:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;a useful model for bringing a &lsquo;measure of resolution&rsquo;  to those affected in long-lasting conflicts&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">As a result, the ECHR has financed the visit of a  delegation from Russia to  meet the HET so that it can learn from the HET&rsquo;s expertise in bringing  resolution to those affected in long-lasing conflicts, such as the one in Chechnya.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The HET was established in 2005 and scheduled to last for  six years. With one year left of the project, only 782 cases, involving 1,007  victims, out of 2,561 cases, have been completed. It is clear that the work  will not be completed within the time allocated, although it expects to  complete more than 1,000 cases by the end of the six years originally proposed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am pleased that the Chief Constable has given his  commitment to continue the work of the HET with a targeted finish of March  2013. He has also indicated that more time will be given if it is required.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Reports, such as those produced by the HET and, indeed, the  Saville report into the events of Bloody Sunday, which we talked about last  week, bring into sharp focus how best we can address the legacy of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  past and how we can move forward as a society.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although the Northern Ireland Office has retained policy  responsibility for addressing the past, there are many issues for the Executive  to consider. I am committed to working with the Office of the First Minister  and deputy First Minister and other Executive colleagues to ensure that the  rights and needs of victims are fully met and that those parts of the justice  system that fall to me play their part. We owe it to the memory of John Martin,  Brian and Anthony Reavey, and to the memory of all other victims of the  Troubles, and to Mr Eugene Reavey, his family circle and the others who were  bereaved and suffered during the Troubles, to commit the Assembly and all the  institutions of government to promote reconciliation and to seek to work  together to build a shared future. I will ensure that the Department of Justice  plays it part.</p>
