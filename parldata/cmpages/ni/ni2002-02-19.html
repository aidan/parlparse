                Enterprise, Trade and Investment that he wishes to make a
                statement on telecommunications.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Enterprise, Trade and
                Investment (Sir Reg Empey):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the opportunity to address Members
                on the key infrastructural matter of telecommunications.
                Telecommunications is central to economic development, as
                Members have repeatedly drawn to my attention, especially those
                from rural areas. It is also key to the knowledge-based,
                science-driven innovation dynamic. It has a strong social
                dimension and is crucial to addressing the digital divide. Much
                is happening nationally and regionally in Scotland, Wales, the
                English regional development agencies and the Republic to
                develop telecommunications policy and to integrate it in a
                broader economic development strategy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important that Members be up to speed
                on all those developments, especially the response in Northern
                Ireland. Accordingly, I shall take three steps to set a
                framework for discussion. First, I shall outline the key
                parameters of the telecommunications issue and the complex legal
                policy and economic dimensions involved in addressing it.
                Secondly, I shall show the position of Northern Ireland in
                relation to telecommunications provision as outlined in the
                Mason Communications Report, which I placed in the Library early
                in December. Finally, I shall outline the action that is
                currently in train to advance telecoms policy and strategy in
                Northern Ireland and current and proposed initiatives.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will now deal with the key parameters.
                Telecommunications has interesting similarities to, and
                differences from, energy. Unlike energy, telecommunications is
                neither devolved nor regulated regionally; it is a reserved
                issue that is regulated nationally.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, like energy it is privatised,
                independently regulated and confronts the challenge of the very
                small market in Northern Ireland, which, in particular, tests us
                in attracting private sector investment and promoting
                competition. Also, like energy, access to telecommunications is
                vital both commercially and domestically, so, like energy, it is
                a major infrastructure issue with very specialist applications.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Just as there are different fuel and energy
                sources, such as oil, gas, coal, lignite, and renewables, there
                are very different telecoms technologies with different
                applications and opportunities — for example, fibre, copper,
                wireless, mobile and satellite technologies. Many of those
                technologies are either at a relatively early stage of
                development or are still maturing, so it is an industry with
                exponential technological development.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The past 18 months have been a turbulent time
                for the sector; the industry has gone from rapid expansion to
                severe downturn and a scaling back of planned growth. In
                Northern Ireland we have first-hand experience of the impact of
                that downturn. The major implications of these factors are: the
                need to develop policy in a national context, in collaboration
                not only with the Department of Trade and Industry and the
                e-Envoy but also with the different and competing interests in
                the private sector and with the independent regulator; the need
                to ensure that in that context Northern Ireland has as much
                flexibility as possible to develop telecoms strategy in the
                interests of this region and to ensure that we keep up with
                Scotland, Wales, the English regional development agencies and
                the Republic; and the need to ensure that our actions are
                compatible with EU competition and state aid rules.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Accordingly, I ensured that Northern Ireland
                was represented fully on the e-Minister’s stakeholders group,
                which reported to the Prime Minister at the end of November. I
                met both the e-Commerce Minister and the Secretary of State for
                Trade and Industry, and received assurances that we can develop
                distinctive policy in Northern Ireland so long as there are no
                EU complications and no additional funding implications for the
                Northern Ireland block. My officials have made links with
                Scotland and Wales to ensure complementarity with them.
                Officials also have very close links with the Department of
                Public Enterprise in the Republic, since on this issue there is
                a potentially strong North/South dimension in the evolution of
                telecoms policy, and North/South activity may well be important
                in the context of INTERREG III.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Picking up on the key recommendations in the
                Mason Communications benchmarking study, and following
                discussions with the local stakeholders, my Department has
                developed a broad strategic approach to implementing the strong
                emphasis on telecoms in the Programme for Government. I will
                summarise the Northern Ireland position as outlined in the Mason
                Communications report. This study compared Northern Ireland’s
                current infrastructure with the Republic, Great Britain and
                selected US, European and East Asian exemplars.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the main points identified in the
                study was that Northern Ireland’s backbone network, which is
                predominantly fibre-based, is on a par with international best
                practice. It gives us a strong telecommunications base,
                comparable to that in the Republic of Ireland and the other UK
                regions. It also means that broadband telecommunications using
                private leased lines are available readily across Northern
                Ireland. Companies such as Stream International and GEM have
                built their businesses through broadband telecommunications.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other companies not in the information and
                communication technology (ICT) sector, such as Ulster Carpet
                Mills, are working more effectively in the global marketplace
                using broadband, and companies such as Shorts and Nortel
                routinely use videoconferencing to communicate with their parent
                companies in Canada.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">OFTEL regulates the prices that the incumbent
                operator can charge for a range of telecoms products and
                services, including leased lines. However, I recognise that the
                level of these costs means that they are often not appropriate
                for small and medium-sized companies, which form the bulk of our
                business profile in Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Members have been keen to point out to me
                on several occasions, the key issue in telecoms provision is
                local access, linking customers to the new and developing
                high-speed, high-volume services and, especially, at a cost that
                companies feel they can justify.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In this regard we face exactly the same
                challenges as every other region in the UK and the European
                Union.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The benchmarking in the Mason Communications
                study highlights that Northern Ireland is on a par with most
                other regions and, crucially, that it faces the same
                intimidating challenge: to encourage the private sector to
                provide broadband access to sparsely populated and
                non-commercial areas, especially during the current telecoms
                market downturn.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Mason Communications Report makes a clear
                distinction between the broadband services required by the vast
                majority of companies and those required by telecoms-intensive
                knowledge-based industries such as back-office operations and
                multimedia computer software operations. It is also important to
                recognise that there is a range of competing technologies, each
                with its own positives and negatives, different applications and
                different market prospects. New technologies are continually
                emerging and presenting new challenges and opportunities, so
                there is no single or specific magic bullet technology that
                will, at a stroke, answer the needs of all industries.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In conclusion, the Mason Communications study
                indicates that in a privatised market with competing
                telecommunications suppliers the Government have to remain
                technology-neutral while, at the same time, doing what they can
                to demonstrate the applicability of various technologies and to
                stimulate demand for broadband services. In effect, Northern
                Ireland’s twin challenges are basically non-technological: to
                increase demand and increase competition.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Within the perimeters I have outlined – and
                taking full account of the current Northern Ireland position and
                the challenges we face – my Department is already engaged in a
                proactive programme with three key facets.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To stimulate demand, we must demonstrate to
                potential users, particularly industry and the small and
                medium-sized enterprise (SME) sector, what each technology can
                contribute to their business and the associated costs.
                Accordingly, I have established an e-solutions centre at the
                Industrial Research and Technology Unit (IRTU) to demonstrate to
                business not only the various technologies on offer, but the
                costs and quality of service associated with them. At the new
                centre demonstrations are provided of broadband access
                technologies such as leased line, asymmetric digital subscriber
                line (ADSL), integrated services digital network (ISDN),
                standard telephone, satellite, wireless access, mobile 2·5 G
                and Bluetooth, which is wireless technology.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The e-solutions centre provides the only
                facility in Northern Ireland where companies can compare and
                contrast these technologies and get impartial objective advice
                from skilled telecoms experts. Indeed, the facility has been
                visited by the regional development agencies in the rest of the
                UK and is regarded as a leading example of demand-side activity;
                it is a facility that many of the regional development agencies
                may well replicate in the months ahead.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">IRTU is developing an outreach marketing
                strategy, which will entail taking that expertise out through
                the rest of the region. That strategy will include sub-regional
                demonstrations of leading-edge technology at key locations
                throughout the Province. Regional advisers have been appointed
                to operate with this outreach activity and to provide guidance
                and advice on a one-to-one basis to companies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those three very different initiatives will
                serve not only to demonstrate the relative use of each key
                technology, but to stimulate market demand. In this context I am
                particularly keen to address the potential needs of SMEs,
                especially those outside the Greater Belfast area without access
                to affordable broadband telecommunications.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have already announced financial aid for
                SMEs in such areas to facilitate their access to broadband
                services via satellite. That – again an exemplar initiative
                – provides each SME with up to 50% support for both the
                setting up and first-year running costs of satellite connections
                up to a maximum of £1,500. To date, over 60 requests for
                application forms have been received. Over 20 of those have been
                completed and returned, and 10 letters of offer have been
                issued. I am confident that our target of 250 SMEs will be
                achieved.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An additional benefit of the programme has
                been the stimulation of the satellite market in Northern
                Ireland, with four satellite providers — Aramiska, Xantia,
                Eirstream, and BeyondDSL — as well as BT, contacting IRTU to
                state their intentions to pursue proactively local demand.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">10.45 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I understand that we are the first region in
                the UK to implement this kind of initiative, and in our recent
                discussions with the Department of Public Enterprise in the
                Republic, considerable interest was expressed in the possibility
                of replicating the initiative in that jurisdiction.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to the Department of Trade and
                Industry’s £30 million broadband fund, I have also secured
                £1·5 million from that Department for a range of innovative
                feasibility schemes and pilot actions designed to examine
                various ways of extending broadband technologies to a wider
                range of users. My Department will soon be inviting applications
                for feasibility and pilot actions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In that context, my Department has already
                contacted local councils, as we recognise that they could have a
                key role to play in facilitating local access in their
                communities, and we will be taking forward our discussions with
                the economic development consortia, involving organisations such
                as CORE, SEED and Into the West. We will be contacting those
                organisations to discuss possible ways of working together to
                stimulate feasibility and pilot actions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since the Mason Communications study
                concluded that the main problem in Northern Ireland — as in
                many other regions and countries — is local access, we have
                also been considering how best to create market demand to
                encourage broadband roll-out by the private sector. That is
                another important area in which local councils, public bodies
                and private sector contacts can play a collaborative role in
                creating demand. Accordingly, my Department is working towards a
                call for proposals for local access projects and a request for
                expressions of interest in possible flagship projects that
                might, for example, link our science park developments with our
                research centres of excellence.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Members will be aware, current market
                conditions are not immediately conducive to a positive response
                from the private sector — though not precluding a significant
                response from the public sector — so the precise timing of
                such calls and requests requires careful consideration, as do
                the state aid and legislative implications. Work is currently
                proceeding on both those issues, and I propose to keep the
                Assembly informed of subsequent developments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Meanwhile, I would be grateful if Members
                could encourage as positive a response as possible in their
                respective constituencies to our current demand-side
                initiatives, especially from their district councils, working in
                concert or collaboration with one another. The more that local
                councils, other public sector bodies and the private sector work
                together and pool their requirements to create the necessary
                critical mass of market demand, the better. We would be
                particularly keen to see consortia-based activities, preferably
                with different technological applications.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In that collaborative context, the
                aggregation of public sector demand is a particularly important
                issue. I am pleased to say that an interdepartmental working
                group has been established, following discussions with the
                Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister, to
                examine how best to approach the aggregation of public sector
                demand within Government and the related public services. It
                might not be possible to do that in all circumstances, and
                various initiatives are under way to promote the greater use of
                broadband in the areas of education, libraries and health.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A formidable amount of work is proceeding on
                the progressive development of the telecommunications strategy.
                Much work has been, and is being, done to advance this important
                economic and social issue. Over the coming months, further
                initiatives will be proceeding, and I am looking to a continuous
                dialogue with the Assembly and its Committees as this important
                issue is taken forward.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr McDonnell:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister’s statement,
                especially the announcement of the e-solutions centre. That is a
                great move forward. It begins to create a healthier e-commerce
                culture around the various funding packages, especially that for
                small and medium-sized enterprises. The granting to them of
                access to broadband services is most welcome. However, can the
                Minister go a little further and be more specific about what we
                are doing, if anything, on a hands-on version to demonstrate
                applicability and increase usage?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He mentioned local government and our various
                constituencies, and I will do all in my power to promote the
                thing. He even mentioned the aggregation of public sector demand
                for broadband, and that is my greatest concern. I wonder what,
                if anything, we can do to bring the various Government
                Departments under our control into the twenty-first century. The
                public sector seems to have a massive resistance to getting
                wired up and using e-commerce to its full extent.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am particularly concerned about health,
                where I have some expertise. Again, I emphasise that I am not
                making a political point, or pointing the finger at the Minister
                of Health. I am simply asking that those people down the line in
                the bowels of the Department of Health, Social Services and
                Public Safety get their act together, because we are in the
                nineteenth century in terms of communication strategy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Minister feel that there is
                something that can be done? There is no point in preaching to,
                or pushing, the private sector, if our own house is not in
                order.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr McDonnell is correct in saying that we
                have to lead by example. We have trawled round all the
                Departments and asked them to tell us the level of demand that
                they currently experience. Dr McDonnell is also correct that
                health would be the largest single user. Clearly, health and
                education would be the largest users in the Government sector.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the reason for aggregating public
                sector demand is to find out what everybody currently uses, to
                estimate growth and to find out what the total is. Currently
                every Department does its own thing, has its own
                telecommunications budget and makes its own arrangements.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The purpose of this exercise is to find out
                how many users are in a particular area and what their volume of
                use is. Private companies will not put in the services unless
                there is a critical volume of use. Many of the companies will
                not know what that is. Indeed, the Government do not know.
                However, over recent months — especially in the past year —
                we have learnt more about the demand out there. We have a much
                clearer picture today than we had a year ago.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Two things will happen. First, if a major
                user of broadband is just up the road, it will be much cheaper
                for a company to link into that when it is nearby than if it was
                at a long distance. That is common sense. Secondly, we must get
                competition into the market, and that is the only way we will
                bring costs down. If suppliers begin to see where there is a
                volume, they can focus on that area and put the infrastructure
                in place. They will know that there will be an economic volume
                of traffic to justify the investment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Basically, it is a very simple exercise.
                Local authorities, working in conjunction with groups in their
                area, will have better local knowledge, and they can go through
                the exercise locally and identify where the key users might be.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr McDonnell talked about resistance.
                Initially there may have been a little resistance, but that is
                breaking down. When I was in London in November 2001 I met
                Douglas Alexander, the Minister at the Department of Trade and
                Industry who has responsibility for these matters. He made it
                clear that the Government in London are making this one of their
                top priorities. The public sector has a critical volume that can
                stimulate this demand and take the lead. That is what we are all
                trying to do.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I said that the Department of Enterprise,
                Trade and Investment is trying to stimulate demand by other
                means. We have the centre at IRTU where people can come along
                and see all the technologies in front of them. What do ADSL,
                wireless, and satellite mean? People can come to the centre and
                find out.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They will get indications of what it will
                cost them and what it will do, and they will take advice. Five
                advisers have been appointed throughout the Province. They will
                talk with companies on a one-to-one basis, and training can be
                provided if it is deemed necessary. We are trying to take the
                message out to the country so that people will have access, and
                we are trying to stimulate demand, something about which I have
                been frequently asked in the Chamber.</p>

                infrastructures, and they are useful as a means of overcoming
                remoteness and rurality. I welcome the Minister’s efforts on
                the SMEs. As far as my constituency is concerned, the emphasis
                must be on the small rather than the medium. Given the
                Department of Agriculture and Rural Development’s recent
                statement on the vision for agriculture and rural
                diversification, what co-operation has the Minister’s
                Department had with the promotion and stimulation of broadband
                and, indeed, other forms of telecommunications, so that rurality
                and remoteness are replaced by equality of opportunity for the
                rural west?</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not know whether it is because the
                debate is about telecommunications, but I am experiencing a
                great deal of interference and white noise. Before I call the
                Minister to reply, I ask Members who wish to have conversations
                to have them in the Lobby and let those Members who are
                desperately struggling with this complex matter to hear what the
                Minister says.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">May I suggest that satellite technology might
                be the cure for that, Mr Speaker?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Gibson has questioned me on several
                occasions over the past two years on this. Indeed, all the
                members of team West Tyrone have questioned me consistently and
                frequently on this. He is correct. This can be one of the tools
                that we can use to ease the problems of remoteness in the rural
                west. We are currently using IRTU’s new pilot scheme, which,
                as I referred to in my remarks, is the first in the United
                Kingdom. We have put £250,000 into this scheme. It means that a
                small company — it could be a one-or-two- person company —
                can apply to the Department, and we will assess the application.
                We will pay up to £1,500 or 50% of the cost of the hardware,
                the software and half of the first year’s running costs. At
                the end of that year we will assess the position of the company
                and whether it feels that it has benefited.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have also secured £1·5 million from the
                Department of Trade and Industry in London, which will enable us
                to undertake such pilot schemes. In the first instance, we are
                thinking of a wireless-based scheme, which would be very
                suitable for a rural area. A base station linking a number of
                users in a particular geographical area would provide those
                people with access. That is a pilot that we could run, and there
                are others. The whole purpose, as Mr Gibson will know, is to
                provide access and to level the pitch for people in remote
                areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a misunderstanding about broadband.
                It is widely available in Greater Belfast and throughout
                Northern Ireland, because there is a backbone network through
                most major towns. However, it can be an expensive process to get
                involved in, so we are looking for a variety of technologies.
                Away from the major centres of population, although technically
                possible, it is in practice economically impossible.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are exploring cheaper technologies, and
                satellite has helped. We have four operators in the market that
                are suited to areas such as west Tyrone. The Department of
                Agriculture and Rural Development has responded positively to
                our request for information about demand. Opportunities,
                especially for rural areas, will present themselves under
                INTERREG III.</p>

                local economy is technologically proficient and can compete in
                the global marketplace. The Minister has stretched himself in
                exploring all possibilities. Does he agree that satellite
                technology is the most expensive and least cost-effective
                system, notwithstanding the grant aid that would be needed to
                cover set-up costs and running costs for the first year? That
                system would institutionalise disadvantage in the rural
                community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">BT has a fully developed fibre-optic system
                in all its main exchanges in the North. In exchange for the
                modest investment of £250,000, it could render proficient each
                of the exchanges in their delivery of an ADSL to every
                household, small and medium-sized enterprise, college, school,
                hospital, medical centre and Department, which would facilitate
                joined-up government. Would that not be more cost-effective?
                Would it not create the level playing field that some Members
                and the Minister referred to if BT were encouraged to accelerate
                the process of upgrading its exchanges from south Fermanagh to
                north Down and for everyone in the North. Go raibh míle maith

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not accept that satellite is the most
                expensive form of technology. Satellite could be one of the
                least expensive technologies for rural areas. It would cost a
                fortune to install a hard wire in a rural area. In some cases,
                it would be almost impossible to finance without a huge subsidy.
                Satellite could cost £150 to £300 a month to operate. There is
                a misunderstanding about ADSL. For technical reasons, it works
                only in a radius of 3 to 5 miles of its exchange because of
                electricity and the movement of data, so one can imagine the
                number of stations that would be required. Each station costs
                between £200,000 and £300,000.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">ADSL is suitable only in certain situations.
                The system allows a user to receive eight times more information
                in than it can give out; it is asymmetric. It would, therefore,
                be useful to a domestic user who wants video information. Such a
                user could get plenty of information in and would not need to
                put it out again. We must be careful not to focus on only one
                technology, because not every technology works in the same
                situation. Provision should be made on a case-by-case basis. One
                reason that the Department has avoided backing a specific
                technology is that the situation is evolving continuously. New
                inventions and developments are coming forward. We cannot say
                today what will be necessarily the most suitable solution in one
                or two years’ time, so we will try to remain
                technology-neutral.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, I assure Mr McLaughlin that we have
                established that at the very least we are on a par with, and in
                some cases better than, our nearest competitors in the Republic
                and in the rest of the United Kingdom, and our intention is to
                ensure that we remain ahead. Secondly, we are the first region
                in the UK to run this pilot scheme. Thirdly, Mr McLaughlin
                should be aware that we have a full and major commitment — not
                only on the equality issue, but because it makes economic sense
                — to ensure that all the Province can make a contribution to
                our economic development. They can do it on the basis that they
                will be on as level a playing field as we can possibly make with
                the major centres of population.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Basically, that is our policy. The costs will
                change from year to year, and that is a lesson that we have
                learnt. However, I assure Mr McLaughlin that currently satellite
                technology is not the most expensive.</p>

                between councils, and that local government needs are considered
                within the group?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Beggs will be aware that through the
                Department’s information age initiative, the local enterprise
                network succeeded in its bid and received one of our major
                projects. The local enterprise network received money from the
                Executive programme funds. Indeed, it is one of the leaders.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with him that, consequently, IT
                partnerships are a key issue. As he is a member of one of the
                local authorities in the core group, which comprises local
                authorities in County Antrim and County Londonderry, he will be
                aware that those local authorities are already working together.
                It is a consortium that has the potential to take forward an
                issue such as this. The south-east economic development (SEED)
                group of local authorities in the Province has the opportunity
                to do the same.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the link with the
                universities, there is a system called SuperJANET, which is a
                fibre-based exchange that allows huge amounts of information to
                pass between research centres in universities. I do not think
                that local further education colleges are currently linked to
                it, but I understand that it is being considered that where
                research is being conducted, there is a need for broadband
                availability.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support Mr Beggs in saying that the
                interdepartmental working group is working actively on ways in
                which we can stimulate demand. More and more people have access
                to those technologies, but our job is to ensure that people use
                them. Three years ago Northern Ireland was almost bottom of the
                UK league of people having access to those services. We have
                caught up and are now competitive. However, we have to stimulate
                the demand even further, so that when we come to the point of
                encouraging companies to put in the infrastructure, they know
                that there is enough to justify their investments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We welcome IT partnerships, and we encourage
                them to progress the roll-out of broadband locally as an
                economic development tool. We sought proactively to promote
                partnerships between local authorities and the local enterprise
                agencies. We are carrying out those two policies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Further education colleges and universities
                are linked to the SuperJANET network. Therefore, we already have
                links in the further and higher education sector. In the
                information-age initiatives we are seeking to encourage the same
                links through the enterprise agencies. If that is encouraged, I
                believe that it will result in increased demand.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McMenamin:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Telecommunications are paramount in our
                economic and social structure, with so many users now being
                online. Does the Minister envisage cross-border links,
                especially in border regions, with other servers to provide a
                service for the rural population? Households in West Tyrone
                cannot avail of ADSL or affordable broadband services.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McMenamin, like Mr Gibson, has availed of
                the opportunity to draw my attention to his constituency, as he
                has done on several occasions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are undoubtedly cross-border issues.
                Through INTERREG III there is potential for co-operation where
                there is currently no broadband availability. There are also
                opportunities through InterTradeIreland, which has the potential
                to invest in particular business-to- business projects. However,
                there is a wider issue here. Currently, we have only one major
                cross-border link, which runs down the eastern corridor. If
                anything goes wrong with that link, there are major difficulties
                — for example, if a digger breaks the link. There is,
                therefore, merit in having an alternative route to reinforce the
                service and provide a security of service. That is being
                considered.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is also the roaming call problem, where
                the situation could arise, under the Eircom link, of having to
                make an international call from one part of a town in Northern
                Ireland to another part of the same town. That is not so much a
                governmental issue as one for the private companies to resolve,
                but it will have to be dealt with on a bilateral basis.
                Regulators may become involved in that problem.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The cross-border dimension has been reflected
                in discussions between my Department and the Department of
                Public Enterprise. There is also a huge east/west dimension. The
                world is a big place, and this is a relatively small
                geographical area. Companies are operating in both
                jurisdictions, and there is potential, especially in the rural
                areas, to extend the availability. The right answer for all
                situations will not always be ADSL — there are alternatives.
                We want to have test runs with satellite and wireless
                telecommunication for rural application.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Paisley Jnr:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Minister agree that this technology
                sets the boundaries for technological and economic development
                for the future? Does he agree also that the key issue is local
                access, because it will determine inward investment in the
                future?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wrote to the Minister about the situation
                in Ballymoney and the issue of remoteness — a subject that
                other Members have addressed. In that area, broadband is
                available only to users in a 5 km radius of the telephone
                exchange. There is a capacity of only two megabytes per second
                (MBPS), and that allows only 60 concurrent users at any one
                time. Does the Minister agree that such limited availability
                will make it difficult to attract inward investment to that
                area?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will he address that problem by ensuring that
                the pilot and feasibility schemes that he has announced will
                look sympathetically at Ballymoney and other rural areas that
                are off the main hub connections, and that such areas will get a
                fair crack of the whip of technological advance?</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.15 am</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yes, I will. The main focus of the initiative
                is local access. Mr Paisley has drawn the Ballymoney issue to my
                attention. It is true that there are several ADSL-enabled
                exchanges in Northern Ireland, but there are none at Ballymoney.
                The closest ADSL exchanges are in Ballymena and Coleraine. No
                one beyond about 4 km or 5 km of the exchange has access to the
                technology, because of the technical issues. That reinforces my
                point that ADSL may not be the solution in every circumstance.
                Access to the service is the key issue. How the service is
                provided is a secondary issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I assure Mr Paisley that consideration will
                be given to the interests from that area. I do not know whether
                we have had applications from that area; perhaps it is too early
                to say. I said that there have been about 60 applications; the
                actual number may be over 70. I am confident that we will reach
                the target of 250 applications, although the programme has been
                running for only a few weeks. A range of technological solutions
                can counter the problem of remoteness that Mr Paisley mentioned,
                and I assure him that applications from the Ballymoney area will
                be given full consideration.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Telecommunications infrastructure is now as
                crucial as any physical infrastructure. I welcome the
                e-solutions centre at IRTU, which will greatly benefit small and
                medium-sized enterprises. Can the Minister tell us how the
                regional organisers will operate? Where will they be based, and
                will their budget be adequate to engage effectively with small
                and medium-sized enterprises? Given that public service agencies
                and Government Departments could make greater use of that type
                of technology, does the Minister believe that decentralisation
                of Civil Service jobs could be facilitated in regional towns?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Byrne never misses an opportunity to raise
                that issue. I did not expect it to be raised in this round of
                questions, so he did very well to squeeze it in. My Colleague
                Seán Farren is dealing with the matter of decentralisation of
                Civil Service jobs, and he has the report on it. The
                availability of appropriate telecommunications, which are
                crucial for the operation of any Government Department, is a
                significant issue. Undoubtedly, it will be easier to facilitate
                decentralisation where such facilities exist.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I said that there would be five special
                advisers. They will be able to work from the LEDU client list,
                and will have those connections. The LEDU client executives will
                be able to direct the special advisers to their customers so
                that they can update them. That does not mean that only LEDU
                clients can avail of the service. Anyone who contacts the
                e-solutions centre to seek advice or help can be facilitated
                through regional LEDU offices. However, I suspect that the LEDU
                client list will be the main source of clients. Those companies
                must be stimulated to avail of the appropriate technology, or at
                least to test it. It may not be suitable for everybody. However,
                we would like to see whether companies improve their business
                after using the technology for a year, or whether they gain or
                learn something from it and feel that it adds genuine value to
                their activities. There are no guarantees, but there will be
                results in many cases. Those results will be measured and
                tested, and that is how we intend to proceed.</p>

              Minister with responsibility for co-ordinating Her Majesty’s
              Golden Jubilee celebrations in Northern Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The year 2002 is a historic one for the entire
              United Kingdom and Commonwealth. However, it is tinged with
              sadness following the death of Her Royal Highness, The Princess
              Margaret. The Assembly will know that it was in respect of the
              wishes of the palace that I did not make any public statements on
              that event last week. Members know that others did not show the
              same respect. That was regrettable and, indeed, shameful, because
              the disrespect came from those who loudly and at every opportunity
              profess their fidelity to Her Majesty. Although I kept a silence
              that was motivated entirely by my determination to comply with the
              wishes of the palace and Whitehall Departments, I had to listen to
              my actions being described, from the DUP Benches, as
              &quot;obnoxious, revolting and scurrilous&quot;. <i>— [Official
              Report, Bound Volume 14, p257].</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Disgraceful scenes took place in the Chamber
              last week. However, the Assembly can get over that. It can and
              must raise the Golden Jubilee from the output of petty minds in
              the House to a higher level. The Assembly must demonstrate that it
              can rise above that and show that it can work together for the
              people of Northern Ireland in a mature and civilised manner. Let
              us show Her Majesty what we are capable of.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is typical of Her Majesty that she will not
              allow personal circumstances to disrupt her duties as Queen and
              head of state. She is currently fulfilling several Commonwealth
              engagements around the globe. That is hardly surprising, as her
              life has been dedicated to her nation and the Commonwealth. That
              devotion and unselfishness are traits that have made her such a
              remarkable person. She has earned the admiration, respect and
              affection afforded her throughout the world. She has done that for
              the past 50 years — only the fifth monarch to do so in the past
              1,000 years. Her Golden Jubilee is a milestone in our history and
              is worthy of appropriate recognition.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Not everyone in Northern Ireland will share
              those sentiments. However, the fact that we sit in the Assembly
              shows that the Province is entering a new era. Together we have
              broken new ground across society. People realise that we must work
              together for the sake of our children and for future generations.
              Now, more than ever, there is greater appreciation that the
              histories of all the people of these islands are linked
              inextricably. The monarchy is part of our shared heritage. I am
              not so naive as to expect that all sections of society will share
              in the celebrations. However, I believe that all people will
              recognise that the jubilee is a significant event in our history.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The celebrations that my Department will help
              to fund will not be about defeating foes. They will not be about
              domination of one section of society by the other. They will not
              be about judging others’ values and beliefs. They will not seek
              to achieve any ends other than that which they purport to
              commemorate — 50 years of hard, unstinting duty fulfilled by Her
              Majesty The Queen on behalf of all UK citizens. Different cultures
              can live and work side by side as full partners. Other countries
              have proved that that can be done; Northern Ireland can prove it
              too. I believe firmly that the promotion of one tradition does not
              mean the diminution of the other. The Golden Jubilee year provides
              a platform for the communities in Northern Ireland to come
              together in celebration. It provides a non-threatening opportunity
              to look to the future as well as a chance to look back at the
              events and changes of the past 50 years. I wish to see the Golden
              Jubilee celebrated in style throughout the Province.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure has
              publicised the occasion widely. Although it is still early days, I
              am pleased with the response so far. More than 450 events have
              already been planned. Those will be published in a special
              booklet, titled the ‘Golden Jubilee Diary of Events’, which
              will give an overview of the celebrations taking place across
              Northern Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A small sample of those events includes a
              festival of evensong in Armagh, conducted by the Archbishop of
              Armagh, Lord Eames. A special garden in Newtownards designed for
              curriculum-based activities will also cater for a diverse range of
              community groups, such as people with special needs, the elderly
              and pre-school children. The Indian community will also contribute
              to the festivities by performing dance routines and music in its
              own colourful and unique way.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many events can be expensive to run. Therefore,
              financial assistance is being made available from both National
              Lottery sources and my Department. The Awards for All scheme, run
              by lottery distributors, invites applications from organisations
              and groups that are planning events to celebrate the Golden
              Jubilee.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Department has also initiated a small grants
              scheme for groups unable to accept lottery funding. A budget of
              £200,000 has been set aside for that. More than 260 applications
              are being considered, which demonstrates the high level of
              community interest and shows further evidence of the high esteem
              in which the Queen is held in Northern Ireland. In the light of
              that enthusiastic take-up in the Province, I am investigating the
              possibility of securing moneys to enable another funding round.
              Meanwhile, the Awards for All scheme remains open.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Among the planned events that my Department
              supports is a tour of Belfast for 70 senior citizens, which will

              incomes to take a nostalgic look at the changes that have taken
              place in our capital city in the past 50 years. A one-day event
              will be held in County Down, featuring a historic exhibition that
              will include a display of wedding dresses that are more than 50
              years old, farming practices, the community, local bands and the
              royal family.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A book of memories is being compiled that will
              include personal recollections and photographs for publication and
              posterity by senior citizens in a day care centre in County
              Antrim. The Ulster Museum will display 10 of the finest drawings
              by Renaissance master Leonardo da Vinci, which are on loan from
              the royal library in Windsor Castle.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members will agree that all those projects fit
              neatly into the themes that Her Majesty has suggested are
              appropriate to commemorate the occasion, especially the theme of
              celebrating the community. In addition, several local
              schoolchildren have already participated in a nationwide poetry
              competition. The winners will visit the palace in the summer.
              District councils are also playing their part. Many are organising
              events and assisting financially.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The idea of giving every schoolchild a
              commemorative memento has been floated. I am considering that
              idea. However, its cost would be substantial, and inevitably there
              would be waste. No matter how accurately the likely take-up of the
              offer was determined, some schools would decline to participate.
              Medals may be an option, but they are only one option.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not see why our planning should be
              constrained by what has happened previously; we can allow
              ourselves to be more flexible. I am keeping in mind Her Majesty’s
              wish that there should be no undue expenditure from public funds
              on the programme of celebrations.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Among the options that I am investigating are
              ways in which children might become involved in celebrations that
              could also benefit their educational or personal development, and
              at the same time be fun and memorable. In other words, we can
              approach the subject creatively and imaginatively.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It would be inappropriate for me to go into
              detail now. However, initiatives that I am considering include
              small bursaries for schools or the production of CD ROMs, which
              all schoolchildren might enjoy and from which they would benefit.
              I shall continue to investigate options, and I shall keep the
              House informed.</p>

              at a time when the monarchy is also undergoing a transitional
              period regarding its public perception. Therefore, it is a time of
              change both for the people of the Province and for the monarchy. I
              do not fear that. Times of change are a challenge and a test, and
              the monarchy is facing this time of change with resolve,

              event for many British people, especially those from the Unionist
              tradition in Northern Ireland. This is an opportunity for
              Nationalists to show their commitment to the Good Friday Agreement
              by ensuring that all those who wish to celebrate the jubilee are
              not only free to do so but are encouraged and supported. In that
              context, has the Minister any plans to liaise with district
              councils so that every opportunity exists for a cohesive approach?</p>

              Arts and Leisure is to liaise continually with all interested
              parties. District councils, with local representation, have an
              important role to play, and that will supplement perfectly the
              lottery’s Awards For All scheme, which I have mentioned, and my
              Department’s scheme for non-lottery funding. Wider celebration
              themes are emerging regionally, nationally and internationally.
              Major events have been planned by almost 50 countries, and a prime
              way to feed information to district councils has been to set up a
              local government forum to brief their Golden Jubilee officers.</p>

              Does the Minister see the Golden Jubilee as a unique opportunity

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are many themes coming through that
              reflect our heritage. We have a rich and varied heritage and
              culture, of which the monarchy forms a pivotal part. As I said, it
              is only the fifth time in 1,000 years that a monarch has reached a
              Golden Jubilee, which is a major historic event and something to
              be celebrated on that level alone.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are connections to the monarchy that run
              through these islands. It is important to point out that every
              opinion poll taken in the UK shows that the monarchy and the Queen
              have the overwhelming support of the general public, and that
              speaks volumes.</p>

              disappointment to the House. Given his comments last week, we were

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister’s statement and the lack of
              commitment by his Department tell their own stories. In his
              statement he says that events are costly to organise. Given the
              amount of money that he is placing at the disposal of those who
              want to organise events, you would almost think that they were
              cheap. He has set aside a budget of £200,000. To date, there have
              been 260 applications, so that works out at an average of £769
              per event, which would just about pay for the liability insurance.

              wishes of the House to give every schoolchild a suitable souvenir
              to mark the Queen’s Golden Jubilee, his Department will step in

              huffing last week. I thought that I made it clear to Mr Morrow
              that I was following the wishes of the palace. The Department for
              Culture, Media and Sport issued a statement with the agreement of
              the palace to the effect that there would be no announcements or
              pronouncements on the Golden Jubilee, and that is why I kept
              quiet. So it was not a question, Mr Morrow, of huffing; it was a
              question of obeying the wishes of the palace.</p>

              However, it is a matter that merits a degree of respect, manners
              and decency. This is the Queen’s Golden Jubilee, and it is
              inappropriate for anyone to use it to score cheap, party political
              points.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Morrow spoke of how disappointed he is. This
              is not primarily about money. The proposed celebrations will not
              cost large amounts of money. The Queen’s express wish is that
              there should be no undue expenditure from public funds on the
              programme of celebrations.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Morrow, you should be careful. Please do not
              point — it is rude to point.</p>

              It would be wise, particularly in situations such as this, for

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The award scheme to which I refer is a
              non-lottery fund, which was set up by the Department of Culture,
              Arts and Leisure. There is no closing date for applications to the
              Awards for All scheme. Several organisations object to taking
              lottery funding, so the Department set up a non-lottery fund, the
              fund to which I referred. As I said, given the uptake, I can make
              a case for increasing that fund.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department has been working on the matter
              for some time. In July 2001, it established a Northern Ireland
              Golden Jubilee advisory group. It also set up and publicised the
              special funding scheme, established the local government forum to
              brief district council Golden Jubilee officers, and briefed Lord
              Lieutenants and Deputy Lieutenants. General information leaflets
              were published, some 20,000 of which were distributed throughout
              the district council areas. The Department has also worked with
              other devolved Administrations and Buckingham Palace to arrange,
              for example, the Golden Jubilee poetry competition. A great deal
              has been done, and I am sorry that Mr Morrow is disappointed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some 260 events are planned under the
              non-lottery award scheme alone. There are many other applications,
              and I can argue for more funding. The Awards for All scheme is
              also available. Northern Ireland has planned some 450 events,
              roughly a quarter of all the events planned in the United Kingdom.
              That indicates that Northern Ireland is doing well. More people
              want to celebrate here, and we are organising more events than any
              other part of the United Kingdom. The arrangements should not be a
              matter for disappointment.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department is still considering providing a

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Robert Coulter refers to our in-Department
              non-lottery scheme. The Awards for All scheme is still open — it
              has not closed — and will continue. We launched our non-lottery
              scheme with some £200,000 for grants ranging from £500 to
              £5,000. It is a small grants scheme and in keeping with the
              themes agreed with the palace — themes such as the Commonwealth,
              looking forward as well as back, community service and a giving
              thanks celebration.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have had a large number of applications, and
              we need to be able to assess them in detail. Since the budget does
              not cover all the applications, I can make a case for further
              funding. As I have said, this is not about money. People want to
              celebrate, and whether they get a grant or not, they will go and
              celebrate. Some of the schemes are for street parties organised by
              primary schools. This is about small events, people coming
              together and celebrating and a sense of community. It is also
              about other themes such as giving thanks. The grants scheme in
              itself will not be the index of how many awards or events come
              though. Ultimately there will be far more events than awards,
              because that type of enthusiasm is in the Province.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker, I had hoped that this debate would
              not descend to this level. Of course, I should have realised that
              Rev William McCrea was in the Chamber. When I made reference to
              setting the tone, I was indeed referring to some things that have
              been said to me by Dr McCrea.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The themes we are discussing exhort that the
              Golden Jubilee be relevant, appropriate, leave a legacy, keep
              within reasonable cost. Those are the themes set down by Her
              Majesty — they have been agreed for some time — and they are
              to be realised through celebration, giving thanks, service,
              community, looking forward as well as back and the Commonwealth.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have looked at the prospect of celebrating
              the jubilee through the schools, and if Dr McCrea had asked simply
              whether I agreed that all children had the right to a permanent
              souvenir of the jubilee, then, of course, the answer would have
              been &quot;Yes&quot;. It is vital, however, that the souvenir
              should be in keeping with the spirit of the jubilee celebrations
              and the Queen’s wishes. We have considered medals, and I have
              samples of mementos that seem to be dear to the hearts of some. No
              decision has yet been made. However, the cost ranges from
              £350,000 to £1·25 million, and I am afraid that the cheapest
              one looks like something you would want to take the paper off to
              eat the chocolate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wanted the children in our schools to receive
              something of value, something that they would appreciate. For
              example, one of the ideas was a small bursary per school so that
              each could celebrate the jubilee in its own creative and
              imaginative way. I have investigated that idea, and I can find the
              budget channel for that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another idea was the production of a CD-ROM
              that would provide educational interest to children. We do not
              simply want a memento. This is not about sentiment. It is about
              looking forward and giving something of value to our children. The
              CD-ROM, for example, can provide a permanent educational resource
              for all schools, including information of specific relevance to
              the Golden Jubilee, perhaps looking back at Northern Ireland 50 or
              25 years ago as well as looking forward, which is a key theme.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An educational outreach resource was another
              idea. For example, Museums and Art Galleries of Northern Ireland (MAGNI)
              will hold some exhibitions, and I have mentioned one or two —
              for example, the Queen’s loan of the Leonardo da Vinci drawings.
              We could organise it in the same way as the ‘Kings and Conflict’
              exhibition, through educational outreach and perhaps through
              education packs.</p>

              dissent from my Colleague’s call for Mr McCrea to burst into
              song? Nonetheless, the Minister will be aware that my Colleagues
              and I are not avid supporters of the British royal family. Indeed,
              Mr McGimpsey did acknowledge that many people in the North,
              perhaps 50% of the population, do not share his sentiments with
              respect to unstinting duty and that kind of thing. In other words,
              Irish-minded citizens will not share in the celebrations. Seamus

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Can the Minister assure us that he will draw
              the line where there is an attempt to impose this subject on those
              who have no interest? I also seek a commitment from the Minister
              that he will use his considerable influence in his liaison with
              Belfast City Council to adopt a more even-handed approach with
              regard to funding celebrations for St Patrick’s Day as well as
              the jubilee celebrations.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of course, the point of all of this is that it
              is entirely voluntary. I do not agree with Mr McElduff’s figure
              of 50%. It is much higher than that. Indeed, in the kingdom as a
              whole it is an overwhelming majority, and there is a clear, strong
              will, which is evidenced by the number of applications we have
              received and the number of events that are being planned. They
              will be published in our ‘Golden Jubilee Diary of Events’ and
              Mr McElduff can also see that the response is high and strong.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He spoke to criticise the words
              &quot;enforcing&quot; and &quot;imposing&quot;; nothing is being
              enforced or imposed. This is an opportunity for everyone to
              celebrate. Even if one’s outlook prevents one from celebrating,
              it is an important historic event. It is the fifth time in 1,000
              years that there has been a Golden Jubilee. It is something for us
              all to celebrate in our own way. That is the point of the award
              schemes. It is certainly not something that Republicans or
              Nationalists should feel they should oppose. We can all enjoy it,
              because it looks to the future not just the past.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">St Patrick’s Day is a different matter. As
              Members will be aware, Belfast City Council required that the
              organisers of the Belfast St Patrick’s Day celebrations adhered
              to the criteria laid down by Down District Council. They refused,
              and that was why the application failed. Had they agreed to the
              criteria, such difficulties would not have arisen and there would
              not have been the failed court cases.</p>

              suggestion of a CD-ROM, which, using new technology, would enable
              children to celebrate the event and to learn through the occasion.
              Will the Minister agree to consider a commemorative scroll
              celebrating the Golden Jubilee, which could be designed centrally
              and distributed efficiently by CD-ROM? It may then be possible for
              every child who so wished to receive a personalised scroll so that

              the Queen. Just as people received a memento at the time of the
              coronation, they make the legitimate demand that their
              grandchildren receive a memento of the fiftieth anniversary of the
              Queen’s accession. The Minister says that this is not about
              values or beliefs; then he wisely used the word
              &quot;celebration&quot;. Is the Minister not aware that this
              celebrates the brilliant concept of a constitutional democracy and
              recognises unstinting work over 50 years? Is it not befitting that
              this Government gives every child a memento for the future?</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, I want to reiterate what I said in my
              statement. Mr Gibson spoke of &quot;truculence&quot; and claims
              that his local branch has now increased by seven members — that
              is probably a threefold increase.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">From those benches — <i>[Interruption].</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I said in my statement — and I reiterate
              it for the benefit of Mr Gibson — I kept a silence, motivated
              entirely by my determination to comply with the wishes of
              Whitehall Departments and the palace. Mr Gibson stated that I said
              that this was not about values or beliefs. I did not say that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Gibson again asked the question — and I
              thank him because this is getting finally to the question. It is
              the question that I have already asked myself publicly twice this
              morning, and answered myself. I asked: &quot;Do I believe and
              agree that all schoolchildren have the right to a permanent
              souvenir of the jubilee?&quot; The answer is yes. I have said that
              twice already, and I am now saying it for the third time. Mr
              Gibson clearly missed the answer on the first two occasions, as he
              missed what I said previously when he described it as
              &quot;truculence&quot;.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the fact that the Minister has
              confirmed that it is his view that all schoolchildren should
              receive a permanent souvenir to mark the Queen’s Golden Jubilee.
              I welcome also the other practical suggestions that he has made
              — and is considering — for schools and schoolchildren.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given the high rate of response in applications
              to the grant scheme from those people who are not happy to accept
              lottery funding, will the Minister provide an additional tranche
              of funding to reward the efforts of those who are attempting to
              organise events throughout Northern Ireland?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGimpsey:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Awards for All scheme is still open. It has
              not been curtailed, and there is no closing date. Mr Kennedy is
              referring primarily to the non- lottery scheme that I, through the
              Department, set up for those people, organisations and groups who
              have a moral objection to applying for, and receiving, money from
              the lottery because of the gambling component. A criteria for the
              non-lottery fund will be that groups that have a reservation about
              using lottery money will receive priority. We are still assessing
              and working our way through the applications.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The scheme is heavily oversubscribed. However,
              I believe that I can make an argument for further support and
              resources. It would be wrong for me to make promises, because I am
              not in a position to do so. I repeat again, however, that I
              believe that I can make a strong argument for obtaining further
              resources to supplement the non-lottery fund.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Poots:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I regret the tone of today’s discussion.
              However, it is the Minister who has set the tone, and it was the
              Minister who set the tone last week with the comments that he
              made.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This proposal was in the pipeline for a long
              time, and it was put before the House before the death of Princess
              Margaret. Had the Minister genuinely wished to have the motion
              withdrawn, he could have spoken to the proposer and advised him of
              the situation. Instead, he chose to make a political point out of
              it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is it not the case that in his contribution
              today the Minister is using bombast and attacking the Democratic
              Unionist Party to cover up the fact that he is doing nothing? He
              said that he is aware that the idea of giving every schoolchild a
              commemorative memento is being floated. It is not an idea that is
              being floated, it is a resolution that has been passed by the
              House. He is choosing to ignore that resolution. What is the
              Minister doing to move that resolution forward? What consultations
              has he had with other Departments? Has he looked to the private
              sector to help to supplement the funding that is required to carry
              out the will of the House?</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not want to go over old ground as far as
              setting the tone is concerned. However, I could repeat what I have
              just said to Mr Gibson. It is tiresome of Mr Poots to repeat the
              same shibboleth, which I reject entirely, and with which any
              reasonable person would not agree. He said that I attacked the
              DUP. I neither attacked nor criticised the DUP. We shall take the
              matter forward in a spirit of goodwill. Mr Poots also accused me
              of doing nothing. I have listed what we have done since July 2001.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nothing has been done about a memento.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGimpsey:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have explained the situation concerning a
              memento. I believe that every schoolchild has the right to receive
              a souvenir. I have told the Member that we are considering that. I
              have even managed to bring in some examples to show him how
              seriously we are taking the matter and how we are addressing it.
              We have received samples and quotations.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The memento could take the form of a CD-ROM or
              a bursary for every school. The latter would provide a legacy to
              allow each school to determine, in its own creative and
              imaginative way, how it can provide children with a souvenir to
              make the event memorable. It has been proposed also that linkages
              be created through the Museums and Galleries of Northern Ireland (MAGNI)
              to provide educational packages. That mechanism was used
              previously for the ‘Kings in Conflict’ exhibition, at which
              educational packs were provided for schoolchildren.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a range of ideas. However, the
              important thing is that we leave a legacy. That is one of Her
              Majesty’s requirements. That legacy must be of value and should
              follow the themes of the Golden Jubilee. It should be relevant,
              appropriate, leave a legacy and be kept within a reasonable cost.
              It should follow the themes of celebration, giving thanks,
              service, community, looking forward as well as looking back, and
              the Commonwealth. The ongoing discussions must determine whether
              that type of memento or souvenir fulfils those aforementioned
              requirements, or whether it should take another form. I have
              mentioned already some of the ideas that we are considering
              through our own jubilee advisory group, which was established last
              year and which is advising the Department and me on the matter.</p>

              &quot;vast majority&quot;, because the gauge is that some children
              might not accept it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister mentioned certain events, which
              included the construction of a special garden in Newtownards
              designed for curriculum-based activities that will also cater for
              people with special needs, the elderly and pre-school children. I
              welcome that permanent feature in the constituency, which I
              represent in the House and in another place. Can the Minister
              provide me with more details of the location, and how the land was

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most Members on this side of the House are
              astounded by the Minister’s revisionism, given his comments in
              the Chamber last week. He did not keep his counsel as he claims to
              have done in his statement. Last week he made a comment that
              unfortunately cast a sad tone on what should have been a happier
              topic. The comments on page 1 of his statement further cheapened
              and party-politicised the matter. Only those who freed Mountbatten’s
              killers could, in the same breath, profess that their loyalty is
              better than that of others.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the depths of his statement, the Minister
              refers to &quot;creativity and imagination&quot;. Does he agree
              that the opportunity for a more tangible and permanent tribute
              should be seized with both hands? Does he agree that a permanent
              motor sport racetrack or, as the Assembly agreed last week, a
              permanent memento that could be put in the hands of all the
              children of Northern Ireland, would be a more fitting tribute to
              Her Majesty and her gracious service to this nation than the
              one-off, short-term, one-day events that are planned?</p>
              <b>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am unsure whether the applicants for funding
              for what Mr Paisley Jnr describes as &quot;one-off, short-term
              events&quot; would agree that those events are worthless. As for
              revisionism, Mr Paisley Jnr is a master of revisionism. He
              suggested that there be a permanent souvenir, but, as I repeated
              several times this morning, one of Her Majesty’s stipulations is
              that there be no undue public expenditure for the programme.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A racetrack, which was suggested, would cost
              many millions of pounds. To build a racetrack would create strong
              reservations in the palace, because that would contradict the
              stipulation that there be no undue expenditure. The Department is
              considering the need for a racetrack through another device, the
              strategy for motor sport racing, which will be published later
              this year. That will determine the needs of the sport and whether
              the sport needs a purpose-built racetrack or the refurbishment of
              existing racetracks.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have stated my position about the provision
              of a permanent souvenir. That should happen in accordance with the
              stipulations laid down by the palace and Whitehall Departments,
              and I will adhere to those stipulations. I need comment no
              further.</p>

              comments today than on his statement. On page 1 he states that he
              kept a dignified silence last week. However, Hansard reports half
              a column of speech by the Minister, part of which is a political
              attack on a motion that was tabled in a dignified way by my
              Colleague Maurice Morrow. The Minister’s words were not
              memorable, but I thought that at least he would remember that he
              spoke, even if no one else did. He has been around the House today
              on the subject of a personal memento for schoolchildren. The
              House, by a majority, passed the motion that there should be a
              personal memento. The Minister has spoken about the costs of a
              memento. He spoke about providing CD-ROMs and other types of
              personal mementoes for schools.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Will the Minister accept the will of the House
              that each child who wishes it should have a permanent and lasting
              memento? Is he so in hock to the Minister of Education, whom he
              seems quite happy to swing with and play hokey-cokey with, that he
              will not do anything to offend him, and hence will try to avoid
              the question of a personal memento? As far as the total cost is
              concerned, a figure of £200,000 has been given, but other events
              are mentioned that have not been costed. What is the total cost
              and total budget in the Minister’s Department for jubilee
              events?</p>

              the Members who did not get beyond page 1 of my statement. He said
              that my words last week were not memorable; clearly they were,
              because he remembered them.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the memento, I have covered this
              issue over and over again. The question was not forthcoming so I
              had to ask it myself, once, twice, three times, and I will do it
              again: &quot;Does the Minister agree that all schoolchildren
              should have the right to a permanent souvenir of the
              Jubilee?&quot; The answer is yes. What type of memento or
              permanent souvenir should that be? We are working on that, and I
              will bring forward ideas to the House in due course. We have set
              up a jubilee advisory group, and it is important that the views of
              people who are working voluntarily to support the jubilee should
              be listened to.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have indicated, ad nauseam, what the budget
              line is for non-lottery funding, and lottery funding is a matter
              for the lottery distributors. The scheme is called Awards for All,
              and there is no fixed closing date, so groups can continue to
              apply. I repeat for those who missed it — and I am repeating it
              for the third, fourth or fifth time — that I can make a strong
              case for further resources for non-lottery funding. That will
              allow people who have a moral objection to the lottery, because of
              its connections with gambling, to come forward and not be

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The aim of the Bill is to bring approximately
              1,700 residents in independent sector residential care and nursing
              homes since before April 1993 into the same care management
              arrangements as other care home residents.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the current community care arrangements
              were introduced in 1993, some 9,000 people in independent sector
              residential care were exempt from new health and social services
              funding and care management arrangements. Instead, they acquired a
              preserved right to an enhanced rate of income support to pay for
              their residential accommodation, and health and social services
              boards and trusts were barred from taking responsibility for the
              care management arrangements for these residents in all but a few
              limited circumstances.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I informed Members yesterday that the Royal
              Commission on Long Term Care for the Elderly recommended that the
              Government consider whether preserved rights payments and social
              security should be brought within the post-1993 system of
              community care funding, or whether some other solution could be
              found to address the shortfall in funding experienced by that
              group. As well as the Royal Commission’s consultation, further
              local consultation on the options was carried out. Overall opinion
              supported a transfer of responsibility for the preserved rights
              cases into normal health and social services care management
              arrangements.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill is being brought forward to transfer
              responsibility for the preserved rights cases into health and
              social services trusts’ normal care management arrangements from
              April 2002. It is considered inequitable that these residents
              should be treated differently from those who entered the care
              system after April 1993. The Bill provides that where a trust has
              been unable to assess a person’s need for services before the
              appointed day, it assumes responsibility from that day until it
              makes whatever arrangements are considered necessary, or until the
              person notifies the trust that he or she does not want to be
              provided with services. Regulations will also be brought forward
              to enable trusts to recover all or part of any payments made in
              these circumstances.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to the disclosure of information
              between the Social Security Agency and the boards and trusts, the
              Bill specifies the type of information that can be shared, and
              with whom. That exchange will enable more effective identification
              of the relevant residents and ensure that when the trusts assume
              their responsibilities, no one slips through the net.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill also contains a provision requiring
              the Department for Social Development to exercise powers under the
              relevant social security legislation so that provisions relating
              to higher rates of income support and jobseeker’s allowance,
              payable to people with preserved rights, will cease to have effect
              on the relevant day.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The final clauses of the Bill contain technical
              and formal provisions relating to the commencement and
              interpretation of the Bill. That will enable the Department, by
              regulations, to make any necessary or consequential provision.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In summary, the Bill is targeted at ensuring
              that those individuals in care homes since before April 1993, and
              in receipt of higher rates of social security benefits to pay for
              their accommodation, are brought into the same health and social
              services care, assessment, management and funding arrangements
              that apply to other home care residents. These residents will,
              therefore, for the first time, receive an appropriate care
              assessment to determine the level of care required and whether
              their current arrangements are fulfilling those requirements, or
              if some further, or different, support is needed. They will have
              the benefit of health and social services contract and care
              management arrangements for the first time, and they will also
              have flexibility to consider and explore other care management
              options, if deemed more appropriate.</p>

              <p ALIGN="left"><b><font SIZE="3">Mr Speaker:</p>
              </font></b><center><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is with much regret that I advise the House
              that Sir John Gorman has decided to step down as Deputy Speaker of
              the Assembly. He will, of course, continue to serve the Assembly
              in his capacity as an Ulster Unionist Assembly Member for North
              Down. I would like to take this opportunity to pay my own tribute
              to Sir John and to convey to him my gratitude for his assistance
              to me as Speaker.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For almost two years, Sir John has made his own
              distinguished contribution to the Chair of the Assembly. His
              dignity, patience and good humour, as well as his firmness when
              required, have added considerably to the conduct of debate in the
              Chamber. I know that I speak also for the other Deputy Speakers,
              Mr Donovan McClelland and Ms Jane Morrice, when I say that he has
              been to all of us a most congenial, thoughtful and supportive
              Colleague.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir John had wide practical experience of
              chairmanship, which equipped him well for his role as a Deputy
              Speaker. From 1996 to 1998 Sir John was Chairman of the Northern
              Ireland Forum for Political Dialogue, which was established as
              part of the negotiations that led to the Belfast Agreement.
              However, that was merely the most recent and perhaps the most
              public of his many roles of public service, which extend right
              back to his front line and highly decorated military service in
              the Irish Guards during the second world war.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir John’s first experience of this House was
              when his father brought him to its opening in 1932. Many Members
              will be aware that Sir John is now the Father of the House. That
              is a particularly fitting title for him. He is the Father of the
              House not only in age, but, more importantly, in dignity and
              distinction. He has earned the respect of Members from all sides
              and, in his capacity as Deputy Speaker, has entertained many
              guests from overseas and represented the Assembly, most notably,
              perhaps, at the historic Tynwald ceremony in the Isle of Man. Sir
              John has been a splendid ambassador for the Northern Ireland
              Assembly. I am most grateful to him for his help and support and
              for his friendship, which I value greatly.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir John, I thank you, and I wish you all that
              is good.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister (Mr Trimble):</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I associate myself and my Colleagues with all
              the Speaker’s comments about Sir John — his service, his
              character and the manner in which he discharged his duties here.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Six years ago, when several of my Colleagues
              and I approached Sir John with a view to his developing a
              political career, he had a distinguished record in public service,
              the army, the police, aviation and the Housing Executive. He was
              replete with honours and age. Nonetheless, he was prepared to
              start an entirely new venture by coming forward as an Ulster
              Unionist elected representative in the Forum. He found himself
              pitched immediately into the deep end in the Chair, where, I have
              the temerity to suggest, he had even less experience than you, Mr
              Speaker, when you found yourself in a similar situation. Despite
              that, he conducted himself admirably, won the respect of all those
              who participated in the Forum and did an extremely good job.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He continued that service as Deputy Speaker in
              a way that has earned him the good opinion of all Members. I would
              be surprised if any Member did not have a warm feeling for him and
              did not, rightly, regard him as a friend.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members understand the circumstances that have
              led Sir John Gorman to stand down as Deputy Speaker. He is to have
              a minor operation in the not-too-distant future, for which the
              House conveys its best wishes to Sir John. The Assembly looks
              forward to his return to continue the excellent service that he
              has given to the House and to the people of Northern Ireland.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister (Mr Durkan):</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker, you spoke in a fitting and
              effective way, on behalf of the House, in paying tribute to the
              enormous contribution that Sir John Gorman has made to the
              Assembly. It is just one further instalment in his distinguished
              contribution to public life, both to the Assembly and to the
              people of Northern Ireland. Sir John brought colour and humour to
              the Chair. He is a man with no sides to him — he deals with
              everyone in a straightforward manner. He is a man of honour in his
              dealings with all parties and with all Members of the House.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall miss him in the Chair. I have missed
              him in the Chair in the past, especially when he has been asking
              me questions from the Floor. He will be missed in the future.
              Members understand and appreciate the circumstances that force him
              to concentrate more on looking after himself and his constituents
              than on looking after all of us in the Chamber. We appreciate Sir
              John’s distinctive contribution. We look forward to continuing
              to work with him and to enjoying his full membership of the House.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr Ian Paisley:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to associate myself with your remarks,
              Mr Speaker, and those of the First Minister and the Deputy First
              Minister. It is a long time since I first met Sir John in the
              famous town of Ballymena, which he knew very well. He was a
              distinguished police officer there. However, he never had the
              privilege of arresting me.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I knew him well. I remember when he was
              chairman of the Housing Executive. He visited a certain housing
              estate. Many of his co-religionists lived on that housing estate.
              We had an interesting time. Many times, we have exchanged some of
              the wonderful things that were said to him as chairman of the
              Housing Executive and some of the more wonderful things that were
              said about me as Member of Parliament for the area. That was an
              interesting time.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I sat under his chairmanship of the Northern
              Ireland Forum for Political Dialogue with great pleasure. I
              remember the day when he told us that, in his time as a police
              officer, he always liked to have the sun shining into the eyes of
              those whom he was questioning. He looked down at the DUP side of
              the House and said that the sun is shining in the eyes of those
              men today. I never forgot that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir John did extremely well as Chairman of the
              Forum. The DUP had its differences with him, as it has had in his
              time as a Deputy Speaker of the Assembly. However, there has never
              been any personal friction between us. We have had a warm,
              personal relationship. The House will be thinking of him and
              praying for him in the near future. I hope that, as Father of the
              House, he will be in the Chamber in the coming days to speak a
              fatherly word to us. The scriptures say that the Father chasteneth
              thee. Sir John did not chasten us too often. We respected the hand
              that wielded the cane.</p>
              <b>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I endorse the comments that have been expressed
              to Sir John and wish him well on behalf of Sinn Féin. The party
              expresses its gratitude for the sense of duty with which Sir John
              Gorman has carried out his work in the Chamber and in the Assembly
              since its inception. I agree with the Speaker’s comments that
              when Sir John Gorman has met people from outside the Building,
              such as visitors from overseas, he has always represented the
              entire Assembly with aplomb, dignity, balance and not without a
              little style of his own. I share in the sentiments that wish him
              well in the near future. We are disappointed that he is unable to
              finish this session as Deputy Speaker. He has done the job to the
              very best of his ability and has treated everyone here with the
              respect that they all deserve as elected representatives. I hope
              that he will be able to spend a little more time as an elected
              representative and, of course, with his family.</p>

              is unnecessary to repeat all that has been said about Sir John to
              endorse the tributes that others have paid. His work as a Deputy
              Speaker of the Assembly, which follows on from his work in the
              Forum, was a cap to a distinguished career of public service, a
              career that has been outlined in considerable detail.</p>

              awkward squad on these Benches created certain difficulties for

              Unfailingly, he responded to us with the courtesy, good humour and
              good manners that we know to be Sir John. I trust that he never
              took it personally — he certainly never gave the impression that
              he did. He always gave the impression that he could deal with
              whatever brickbats were thrown at him in a way utterly befitting
              of any Deputy Speaker of any body.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On behalf of the Alliance Party, I add our good
              wishes to Sir John for the future. We shall miss him in the Chair,

              Party, I identify with the comments that have been made about Sir
              John on his retirement as Deputy Speaker. I got to know Sir John
              at the Forum. Indeed, my lasting memory of him was on a visit to
              the European Parliament in Strasbourg. We had the pleasure of
              accompanying him on the coach from the airport to Strasbourg. Sir
              John gave a running commentary about his wartime exploits, when
              the Germans were routed from the city of Strasbourg during the
              second world war, to which he made an amazing contribution. It was
              a memorable trip and coloured my view of the calibre and stature
              of Sir John Gorman. I wish him a quiet time on the Back Benches
              and all the very best for his future in the Assembly.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I concur with everything that has been said. It
              seems to me that Sir John Gorman’s heart is good. It is not that
              long ago that I met him in politics. His dignity and integrity are
              absolute. I consider him, if he will allow me the luxury, not only
              to be a Colleague, but a friend. In many of the comments that I
              have heard, whether in public or in private, he is eminently a man
              of reconciliation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not about to commiserate his passing from
              the Deputy Speaker’s Chair, other than to celebrate that I have
              known him as a Colleague, and I know that he will be on the Back
              Benches. As the Father of the House, he may have some advice for
              us all.</p>

              our appreciation for Sir John’s role as Deputy Speaker. He
              brought dignity and honour to the Chair, and he will be sorely
              missed. While we appreciate him for his work, we welcome him to
              the Back Benches, both as Father of the House and as a friend. The
              most fitting tribute to him is that there are absolutely no back
              doors in Sir John.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I join with others who have expressed good
              wishes for Sir John. I first made his acquaintance many years ago,
              perhaps as many as 55 years ago — when I did not know really who
              Sir John was — as a reader of a boys’ magazine called ‘The
              Champion’. The magazine had little vignettes of people who had
              done very special things in the war, and one of them featured John
              Gorman. I am not sure whether he was Captain or Lieutenant John
              Gorman, but he was certainly in charge of a tank. He came to the
              conclusion that his tank was not quite as well armed as the German
              Tiger tank and if he stood off he would not have been here in any
              other form. So, according to the account in ‘The Champion’, he
              ran his tank forward, jammed the gun of the much heavier tank so
              that it could not revolve and blow him to smithereens, and thus
              escaped to enjoy longevity and a period as Deputy Speaker of this
              House.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker and leaders of all the parties here,
              I cannot tell you how much all this means to me. I sometimes
              wonder, when I listen to all these things, who it is that you are
              talking about. Some of you have used a little more hyperbole than
              I deserve.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am particularly pleased today that I have my
              dear wife with me — she is up in the Gallery — because she has
              had to suffer an awful lot of inconvenience, irritation and
              possibly boredom in listening to my tales of all of you when I got
              home. I promise you that, generally speaking, you all came out of
              it pretty well, and I am sure that she will think of you all now
              as the rather backward, bashful but affectionate crowd that you
              really are — and you really are, as far as I am concerned.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I think that you should know that today I met
              the surgeon who is going to do the great job on me, and — could
              you believe it — he has the splendid name of Gladstone. I asked
              him about home rule, and he looked a bit abashed because he is an
              Englishman — but he was pretty bullish about my chances, and I
              hope that I will be able to be back with you all in a matter of
              possibly eight or nine weeks.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I really feel that nothing that I could say
              would be appropriate at all to end my little thank you to you,
              other than to say how very happy I have been in the Ulster
              Unionist Party and how much I have been given support and
              attention by all its members, in particular by its leader, and to
              say also of the Speaker that we are very lucky indeed to have such
              a man at our head in conducting our affairs. Every one of you has
              been a friend as well as a Colleague to me, and I thank you. As
              Betty Boothroyd said a little time ago — and I am not going to

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
              </font></b><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to advise the House that, as three
              amendments have been selected and published on the Marshalled
              List, we shall have to address the question of the amendments, how
              to handle them appropriately and the time limits.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are three amendments; the first is in the
              name of members of the SDLP; the second is in the name of members
              of the DUP; and the third is in the name of members of the Ulster
              Unionist Party. They are in that order because that is the order
              in which they come in the motion. If amendment No 1 is moved,
              debated, voted upon and passed, it will amend the motion as
              outlined. Amendment No 2 can then be taken and if it were passed
              would amend the motion as amended by amendment No 1. If amendment
              No 2 is passed, amendment No 3 falls because the part of the
              motion to which it refers will no longer be in place. I remind
              Members of that so that, when they are considering how to vote,
              they will understand those facts.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I propose to allocate 10 minutes to the Member
              who is moving the motion and six minutes for the winding-up. Each
              person moving an amendment will have seven minutes to open and
              five minutes for the winding-up. All other Members will have five
              minutes in which to speak to ensure that as many Members as
              possible can speak in the time-limited debate. However, I realise
              that many Members may wish to speak for longer and that many
              Members who might like to will not be able to speak.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That this Assembly considers that the
              Government’s proposal for dealing with those &quot;on the
              run&quot; constitutes a general amnesty for offences committed
              prior to April 1998, goes well beyond both the letter and spirit
              of the Good Friday Agreement and is inconsistent with both justice
              and international practice. This Assembly believes that the
              minimum requirement consistent with the agreement is that those
              wishing to avail of this measure should be required to acknowledge
              their guilt in court and be released on licence. This Assembly
              further believes that the Government should demand guarantees that
              those &quot;exiled&quot; by the paramilitaries can return to
              Northern Ireland in safety before proceeding with this measure.</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I speak as a member of the Alliance Party and
              as someone who once worked with exiles.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Government’s proposals for dealing with
              so-called &quot;on the runs&quot; constitute a general amnesty for
              all offences committed by paramilitaries associated with
              organisations that are recognised as observing a ceasefire before
              April 1998.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The British and Irish Governments introduced
              the proposal following the Weston Park talks last year. The stated
              intention is not to pursue outstanding prosecutions. However, that
              term has not been defined, nor has a list of those eligible been
              published. In practice, people who have not yet been prosecuted
              for an offence are technically on the run, irrespective of whether
              they are in or outside Northern Ireland or whether the authorities
              are suspicious of them. Such distinctions will not stand up, even
              if the Government seek to make them do so. It is a general
              amnesty.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In a statement to the House of Commons on 24
              October 2001, the Secretary of State committed the Government to
              implementing this package, including the amnesty proposals, in its
              entirety. He stated that it was the Government’s intention to
              address the issue by March 2002. However, they have not yet
              published the full details of the proposals.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is opportune, therefore, that the issue be
              debated now, and I am happy to note that the other parties have
              finally wakened up to the issue. I may not agree with their
              amendments, but, nonetheless, I welcome them. My Colleague David
              Ford will deal with them later. It is also opportune to be able to
              make clear how the proposal will cause enormous hurt to the
              victims of numerous atrocities and undermine both the rule of law
              and any sense of justice.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In comparison, it is important to note that all
              prisoners who have been released were convicted in a court of law
              and thus had their deeds publicly noted. Furthermore, they are
              released on a licence that can be revoked if further offences are
              committed. The Alliance Party recognises that the issue of people
              &quot;on the run&quot; must be addressed. However, the current
              proposals are not a logical extension of the agreement; they are a
              quantum leap forward.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No one has been brought to account for a great
              number of the atrocities of the past 30 years. The interests and
              views of victims have been neglected during this process, and the
              failure to seek prosecutions will only increase victims’ sense
              of hurt. However, the most stunning aspect of these proposals is
              probably their complete failure to address the situation of those
              exiled from Northern Ireland by paramilitaries from all sides.
              Those who have been exiled are not facing conviction and
              imprisonment, but a death sentence.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addressing this complicated and sensitive
              subject, I quote the Prime Minister’s words from the debate in
              the House of Commons last week.</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;If we are genuinely concerned, as we
              should be, about putting the past to rest in Northern Ireland, one
              major part of that is people who were intimidated out of the
              country — the so-called exiles. Of course they should be allowed
              to return in peace. That, I think, would be a proper part of any
              significant undertaking in relation to the peace process. If the
              parties really support the peace process, they should support
              every dimension of it.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There was a general consensus in the debate in
              Westminster Hall that the issues must be dealt with quickly. In
              addition, several Members expressed concern about the fact that
              the issue of exiles had been allowed to drift. As my friend and
              former peace train colleague Prof Liam Kennedy said</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot; We need to break the silence, at all
              levels of society here&quot;.</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As with the issue of victims, the two
              Governments have let paramilitary groups and their related
              political parties off the hook of playing their part to ensure
              that violence of all kinds ceases. If we all support the
              democratic peace process, we must work together as colleagues to
              eradicate all fear and intimidation from society. We must join
              with organisations such as the Maranatha Community and NIACRO,
              with its Base2 programme, to encourage Parliament to force
              concerted action. That would enable families that have been
              expelled or forced out of their homes and who wish to return to do
              so safely. I have worked with all those organisations in different
              ways, and I know the trauma, heartbreak and terror that families
              and young men have suffered and are suffering still. In the main
              they were not expelled because a community wanted it, as has been
              alleged. People were exiled because certain members of a community
              wanted it. These people see themselves as law enforcers and
              appoint themselves as such. They make the decisions and carry out
              the punishments, which, as we know, include horrific beatings
              followed by exile.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is not right to say, as a Sinn Feín Member
              did last week, that if we had an acceptable police force, we would
              not have this problem. In my experience, paramilitary groups made
              their decisions about many youths who were already being dealt
              with by the police and the legal system, decisions made solely to
              demonstrate their influence and power in the communities.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If Sinn Feín is really concerned about
              policing, it has the solution in its hands. Its members should
              join the Policing Board and help to address the wrongs that they
              perceive, instead of standing outside and complaining.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Members know, I come from west Belfast. It
              is only since the Provisional IRA began to exert its illegal
              influence that the RUC started to be discredited there. The police
              are not, and were not, perfect. However, they are making strong
              attempts to deal with the problem, while Sinn Feín and others
              show no willingness to amend or change their views, work with
              others or attempt to achieve a balanced and efficient police
              service to which we can all subscribe.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Maranatha Community and NIACRO and its
              Base2 programme can all provide graphic evidence of the trauma and
              hardship that exiles experience in Northern Ireland and abroad. We
              read about it every day in the newspapers. We must take note of
              the overwhelming evidence and listen to their advice that people
              at all levels must work together to solve the problem. We must
              also note the finding of the Northern Ireland Affairs Select
              Committee’s report ‘Relocation following Paramilitary
              Intimidation’ that a greater degree of focus and co-ordination
              is needed on the real problem faced by those who deal with people
              who have been forced from their homes by paramilitary
              intimidation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The action plan of the Northern Ireland
              Executive must be expedited immediately. Furthermore, the British
              Government must no longer only talk about the problem; they must
              act to ensure that paramilitaries and their related political
              parties are involved fully in the process of halting their vile,
              violent practices.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The number of citizens exiled is increasing,
              and that is unacceptable. A progressive step would be to make the
              necessary finance available to develop programmes such as the
              NIACRO programme for exiles. There must be an end to kangaroo
              courts and informal justice. I hope that the Security Minister,
              Jane Kennedy, is right in saying that with goodwill and support
              from all sides, particularly for the police in Northern Ireland,
              we will turn the tide. The tide must be turned before it is too
              late. I would remind her of this, when she speaks against deals
              being made; deals were made throughout the Good Friday Agreement
              talks on, for example, policing and ex-prisoners. It was felt that
              those deals were necessary at that time so that agreement could be
              reached and peace achieved.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister’s comments against the linkage
              of those two issues would make sense if both were to be given
              equal priority, which is clearly not the case at the moment. That
              issue is important as the Maranatha Community stated in item 16 of
              its report:</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;It is now a widely-held belief amongst
              those caught up at street-level in the ongoing troubles that no
              serious progress can be made towards peace in Northern Ireland
              until this problem of exiles is addressed. It is a festering wound
              which can no longer be ignored.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a personal note, my husband and I were
              exiled twice, and not because of antisocial acts, unless a mixed
              marriage or helping different communities to work together amounts
              to antisocial behaviour.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It would be incredible if the Government
              proceeded with an amnesty for paramilitaries before first ensuring
              that those paramilitaries lift the threats against those whom they
              have exiled. It is not too late for the Government to reconsider
              their proposals and to put them forward in a manner that might
              just be more acceptable — although I am not sure about that. If
              the Government must proceed down this road, they must at least
              require those seeking an amnesty to apply individually, appear
              before a court and admit to the offences where appropriate. They
              then could be placed on licence with suspended sentences, thereby
              providing safeguards in the event of further offences — the same
              system used for ex-prisoners. This approach would be more
              consistent with the agreement and would provide some small sense
              of justice and consolation for the victims.</p>

              human rights abuses, from whatever quarter, including persons
              referred to as being ‘on the run’, should acknowledge and give
              a full account of their actions and recognise the hurt caused to
              and being endured by victims, families and the community. The
              Assembly further believes that those exiled by paramilitary
              organisations should be able to return to Northern Ireland without
              threat to their welfare by paramilitaries.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The SDLP has long been an advocate for human
              rights, and will continue to be so. It does not see human rights
              as some sort of cynical political tool, but rather as something
              precious that must be established firmly in the community and
              embedded in the very foundations of our new political order. Human
              rights must be applied universally, not selectively. Everybody is
              entitled to enjoy human rights and both state and citizen are
              obliged to uphold and respect them.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thus, when paramilitaries offend basic human
              rights by killing or injuring people, they, like the state when it
              offends human rights, are obliged to acknowledge and give a full
              account of their actions to society at large and to victims and
              their families in particular. It is not for Republican
              paramilitaries to ignore their human rights abuses and seek a
              selective, limited amnesty exclusive to themselves. They are not
              entitled to benefit from a process from which other people are
              excluded. The origins of this &quot;on the run&quot; amnesty
              proposal is shrouded in secrecy, but it would appear that it arose
              around May 2000 when the Republican movement was engaged in a
              separate negotiation process with the British Government on
              decommissioning.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What was agreed was unclear. However, last
              year, at Weston Park, the issue became public and part of a side
              bar deal between Republicans and the British and Irish
              Governments. The SDLP was not party to that deal, and it advised
              both Governments that it was extraneous to the Good Friday
              Agreement. It was a separate deal by Republicans for the benefit
              of Republicans. It was a self-serving deal to satisfy their
              internal political needs.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The selfishness and the arrogance of the
              Republican movement are exemplified in that deal. The movement is
              impervious to the greater needs of the whole community. We should
              be victim-centred. Victims in society must be acknowledged. The
              victims — Catholic and Protestant — of Republican violence
              must be acknowledged and affirmed. This proposal does nothing to
              acknowledge those victims and their deep hurt, a hurt that
              continues to pain many people.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That pain will continue to hurt unless there is
              some form of closure. That is why the SDLP amendment asks that
              further consideration be given to a mechanism for human rights
              abusers to acknowledge and give full account of their actions to
              victims and to the community. It is to be hoped that such a
              mechanism can acknowledge victims and can serve as a form of
              public accountability for all in society and for all human rights
              abusers. It is to be hoped that closure can then be achieved so
              that the victims — some of whom are alienated from the peace
              process and from the new political structures — can embrace the
              new political dispensation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is surely right that those who have been
              exiled by paramilitary groups, especially by Republican
              paramilitary groups, should be able to return to their homes and
              their homeland without fear, without let or hindrance. If
              paramilitaries seek an amnesty for themselves, surely it is common
              justice to grant an amnesty to those who were expelled by
              paramilitaries? Not to do so is rank hypocrisy.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Leaving aside the issue of amnesty, and leaving
              aside the motion tabled by the Alliance Party, the issue of the
              exiled stands on its own. Those who have been exiled by illegal
              paramilitary groups have the right to return at any time under the
              new political dispensation. To deny them that right is to deny
              them their human rights, because it is a violation of human rights
              to prevent people from enjoying their home and homeland. Even if
              the motion had not been moved, a fundamental injustice has been
              carried out against the exiled. It is right and proper that the
              House disapproves of that. Those who are responsible for expelling
              those people have a duty to say to them — especially in the
              present political circumstances — &quot;Yes, come home. Yes, you
              have a right to come home, and, yes, you will be unharmed. We, the
              political representatives of the Republican — or Loyalist —
              movement, guarantee you that right to come home and live free from
              harm.&quot;</p>

              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the outset of this debate, Mrs Eileen Bell,
              the deputy leader of the Alliance Party, said it was absolutely
              incredible that the Government would bring forward the proposal
              that they have. The Alliance Party’s motion is absolutely
              incredible. It is both contradictory and unworkable. That is why
              the DUP has tabled its amendment.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion claims that the Government’s
              proposal goes beyond the Belfast Agreement. However, it goes on to
              endorse what the Belfast Agreement has done and to endorse the
              proposal that the Alliance Party says goes beyond the Belfast
              Agreement. Despite saying that it is inconsistent with justice,
              the Alliance Party goes ahead and supports the proposal. It
              supports it by suggesting that the way round it is probably to
              inflict another injustice and turn the due process of law and
              order on its head.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The suggestion that criminals should confess
              guilt and then be sentenced and licensed without a trial is
              inconsistent with any notion of justice or fair play, no matter
              who those people happen to be. The biggest contradiction came when
              Eileen Bell told us of the problems that she personally went
              through, with which we sympathise. She then suggested that we go
              to the people who put her and her family through that and seek an
              assurance from those criminals that they will now be nice people.
              We cannot, and should not, support such a proposal.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The amendment put forward by the SDLP still
              proposes an amnesty. The DUP opposes it for that reason. Mr Alban
              Maginness said that the amnesty was a &quot;sidebar deal&quot;. I
              studied the papers emanating from Weston Park, and I did not see
              one word of condemnation from the SDLP of the communiqué issued
              by the two Governments at that time. If it was a sidebar deal, why
              did that party not condemn it at that time? Why did it then want
              to be associated with that sidebar deal? That is exactly what it
              did.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My party’s amendment is consistent with the
              principles of justice and fairness. It seeks to withdraw the
              shameful offer of amnesty, to deliver complete decommissioning of
              terrorist weapons and to bring to justice those responsible for
              terror in Northern Ireland. No one in the Chamber should be
              opposed to those principles. It is in the interests of the people
              of Northern Ireland to ensure that people are brought to justice
              for their heinous crimes. It is in their interest that we should
              not have a &quot;get out of jail free&quot; card for people who
              have not yet even been convicted for those crimes. It is workable,
              and it should be backed by every right-thinking person in the
              Chamber. To do otherwise is a further concession to terrorism in
              Northern Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An amendment will be proposed by the leader of
              the Official Unionist Party. He has little backing in the Chamber
              today. Although the first sentence of the UUP amendment backs part
              of the DUP’s amendment, it is a denial that the hand of that
              party’s leader is all over the offer that was made at Weston
              Park in the first instance. Let us face it: whether that party
              likes it or not, the amnesty is consistent with the spirit of an
              agreement that lets people out of jail free.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The people who would benefit from this are the
              same sort of people who tried to perpetrate an atrocious act in
              Coalisland yesterday. According to one newspaper, they got out of
              jail free in the first instance under the terms of the Belfast
              Agreement. The people who voted for that should hang their heads
              in shame today when they consider that the people whom they let
              out of jail free are probably engaged in continual terrorism.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This amnesty is a direct result of the Weston
              Park talks. David Trimble went to those talks claiming that
              decommissioning was the only issue to be resolved, yet he came
              away from those talks with proposals that weaken policing, were
              designed to demolish security and, most obnoxious of all, put on
              the table an offer of an amnesty to further terrorism.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us look briefly at the communiqué that
              those parties supported and did not condemn at the time. The
              British Government said that both Governments recognised that
              there was an issue to be addressed with the completion of the
              early release of prisoners. That means that it was not complete
              when the prisoners got out. It had to be addressed because other
              prisoners had to get out. The communiqué went on to say that only
              those organisations signed up to ceasefires should benefit.
              Ceasefires have been meaningless. Since 1998, 99 people have been
              murdered by the same paramilitaries who are supposed to be signed
              up to a ceasefire.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.45 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">According to the communiqué, the general
              amnesty would be a natural development. What would that natural
              development be? People engaged in terrorism and not yet convicted
              should be, in the words of the communiqué, no longer pursued.
              That is what they signed up to, and that is what their
              fingerprints are all over. Not only are Mr Trimble’s
              fingerprints over it, his friend, Mr Donaldson, is also culpable
              because he was there as well. They signed up to it, agreed it and
              supported it at that time.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us consider the people who would benefit
              from such a terrible scheme: Charlie Caufield, who was wanted in
              connection with the Enniskillen bomb; Michael Rogan, who was
              wanted for the Lisburn bomb; Michael Dixon, who was wanted for the
              1996 mortar bomb attack in Germany; Liam Averill, the well-known
              transvestite who escaped from the Maze Prison; Owen Carron; Robert
              Campbell; and Dermot Finucane.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Colleague reminds me that the La Mon House
              Hotel bombing took place 24 years ago this Sunday. A Member of the
              House was questioned in relation to that bombing. Nothing would
              now come of that because all those heinous acts of terrorism would
              be put to one side.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I must remind the House that in the ‘Belfast
              Telegraph’ on 1 August 2001 the leader of the Ulster Unionist
              Party said that the document’s other proposals would be
              irrelevant in the absence of decommissioning. Given that there has
              been no decommissioning, I hope that people realise that David
              Trimble was wrong then when he said that this would be irrelevant.
              It is not irrelevant; it has come to fruition now, and I hope that
              the House supports the amendment.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I congratulate the Alliance Party in tabling
              the motion and for bringing the matter before the House. This is a
              serious matter. I will disagree with some of the terms of the
              motion, but that does not detract from the fact that it has
              brought this serious matter before the House. Other Members will
              also appreciate the significance of having a situation where the
              Alliance Party, who are not noted as opponents of proposals coming
              from the Northern Ireland Office, clearly condemns these proposals
              in unequivocal terms, and that is a good thing. I will offer what
              I think is a better way forward, but it is important to
              congratulate the Alliance Party for bringing forward the motion.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not clear about what the Government’s
              precise proposals are, and I would be delighted if other Members
              were in a position to inform us about that. We have had several
              suggestions. Mr Paisley Jnr read a paragraph from the Weston Park
              communiqué, but that document was not clear about what was being
              proposed. It has been said that it is about legislation to deal
              with people who are &quot;on the run&quot;. That is not the same
              as a general amnesty. A general amnesty would refer to all
              offences that had occurred, and would benefit people whether or
              not they are &quot;on the run&quot;. However, that is not being
              proposed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Part of the reason that we have not seen
              proposals emerge so far is that there is great difficulty in
              defining something that would relate to the handful of individuals
              who are &quot;on the run&quot;, and not relate to others who are
              not. Anything that relates to a specific group will come into the
              category of private legislation; it would not be a general public
              act. There are considerable technical problems in bringing forward
              such legislation. We do not yet know precisely what the provision
              is.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In so far as there is any argument in favour of
              dealing with people &quot;on the run&quot;, the case presented is
              that people who are not &quot;on the run&quot; by virtue of having
              had their cases dealt with under existing legislation can now live
              in Northern Ireland and move about freely, whereas those who are
              &quot;on the run&quot; and have not had their cases dealt with are
              in a disadvantageous position.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In so far as there is a problem, it can be
              dealt with. Those who are &quot;on the run&quot; can come back,
              surrender themselves to the police, go before the courts and apply
              for early release under the early release scheme. Existing
              legislation provides for such cases to be dealt with. The Alliance
              Party’s need for people to acknowledge their guilt in court can
              be met. There is also a provision for those offenders to be
              treated in the same way as others. An important general point is
              that the persons referred to should not gain any privilege over
              others, and should be treated exactly as others have been treated
              since the agreement.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Any measure that would apply only to terrorists
              who were &quot;on the run&quot;, whether they came from one group,
              several groups or all groups, would be repugnant. Many in Northern
              Ireland would find a one-sided amnesty morally repugnant. The
              Government do not understand the strength of people’s distaste
              for the proposals that they are introducing.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Paisley Jnr’s comments were, as usual,
              erroneous. Before, during and after Weston Park, and every time
              that the issue has arisen, we have urged the Government strongly
              not to follow that course.</p>

              DUP amendment, on the other hand, contains the usual posturing,
              sets out an unreal position and does not engage with the existing
              situation. However, my party’s amendment would deal with amnesty
              and provide for the operation of the judicial process.
              Furthermore, it would remind those parties that are related to
              paramilitary organisations of their commitments to the Mitchell
              principles, which deal with the continuing use of paramilitary
              violence, and, by extension, the issue of exiles. For that reason,
              Mr Deputy Speaker, I propose amendment No 3.</p>

              The issue of the &quot;on the runs&quot;, as they have been
              called, is not, as the Alliance Party would argue, one of a
              general amnesty. The British Army, the RUC and the UDR have had a
              general amnesty for the past 30 years. The issue relates to the
              anomalies resulting from the peace process and the Good Friday
              Agreement. The proposals will sort out such anomalies, and are
              precisely in line with the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement and
              the logic of a peace process and a conflict resolution process.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Political prisoners have been released under
              the Good Friday Agreement. That was agreed, negotiated and voted
              on. In other words, we agreed that that would be the outcome.
              Anyone who is pursued, arrested, charged and sentenced, and who is
              a member of an organisation that is on cessation, would be
              similarly released. That is a colossal waste of time and money.
              However, that is not the key issue.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Any such pursuit of those individuals is
              fraught with dangers for the peace process. Can that be the
              intention of the proposers of the motion? I suspect not. However,
              it is the intention of those in the Unionist community who belong
              to the &quot;No&quot; camp. It is their intention to find,
              manufacture and exploit every opportunity to damage the peace
              process. For that reason, Sinn Féin is critical of the approach
              taken by the Alliance Party.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sinn Féin’s approach as a pro-agreement
              party is governed by the logic of a conflict resolution process.
              The matter will be resolved as a result of our engagement with the
              British Government. No other party has sought to resolve this
              matter, and no other party has brought forward any realistic
              proposals to resolve it. The issue challenges those who claim to
              be in the pro-agreement camp, because it must be dealt with and
              resolved. There is no benefit to any community in pussyfooting
              around. The issue must be resolved as part of a conflict
              resolution process. It is interesting to contrast the opinions of
              the proposers of the motion and of the amendments with their
              silence about the British Army, the UDR, the RIR, the RUC or MI5
              — no calls for court appearances there.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The SDLP surrendered on Patten’s minimum
              requirement for those who would be transferring directly from the
              RUC. That is shameful given the RUC’s clear track record of
              involvement in orchestrating murder campaigns, collusion with
              Loyalist paramilitaries and abuse of the civil rights of the
              Nationalist community over many years. I want to refute, on the
              record, Eileen Bell’s revisionist comment that there was a time
              when the RUC enjoyed the support of the Nationalist community.
              Never in its history did the RUC enjoy the support of the
              Nationalist community. In the earliest years of its existence it
              reached the princely height of 19% support, and it plummeted from
              that point.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The RUC’s track record compelled parties such
              as Alliance and the SDLP to make clear their position that if
              there were a general amnesty for the perpetrators of such
              nefarious activities as collusion with Loyalist murder squads or
              the orchestration of murder campaigns, they should also be brought
              to the attention of those who talk about justice. However, we find
              that the old agenda has &quot;not gone away, you know&quot;. The
              old agenda is to close your eyes, institutionalise state violence
              and not to talk about it. Do not talk about the war if it means
              talking about the British Army, the RUC or the UDR. Do not talk
              about the war in those circumstances, but talk about Loyalists and
              the IRA — they are safe subjects.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thus, we find the lopsided debate that has
              characterised those parties’ approach to the peace process. In
              such circumstances, those people will be held to account by a
              community that will judge their double standards, and by a
              community that knows that if we are to have the truth, we must
              have the whole truth. If we talk about people being held to
              account, we must ensure that everyone is held to account,
              including the security services.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My party will not be supporting the motion
              standing in the name of the Alliance Party. As usual, the Alliance

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This agreement, and the amnesty that is being

              even the soft-bellied, slightly green Alliance Party has
              difficulty keeping the decent ordinary people who normally support
              it along the tracks of agreeing that this was what they signed up
              to in the Belfast Agreement.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.00 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Alliance Party got it right at the start of
              the motion by saying that this is inconsistent with justice and
              international practice. Everyone throughout the United Kingdom,
              and perhaps throughout Europe and further afield, knows that the
              stark reality is that Northern Ireland faced a 30-year terrorist
              campaign, yet President Bush and the Prime Minister tell us that
              they will carry out a programme of terrorising the terrorist and
              of making sure that there is nowhere for them to rest their feet.
              Northern Ireland has perhaps suffered most, certainly in Europe,
              yet the final indignity for the victims and the families of those
              who have been maimed and murdered by these terrorists is that the
              terrorists will now be given an amnesty. No doubt Mr Trimble is
              aware that this will be a total amnesty for all terrorist acts
              before 1998.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Alliance Party got it right when it said
              that this was an affront to decency and democracy. However, it got
              it wrong when it said that this process and the Weston Park
              proposal had nothing to do with the Belfast Agreement and that it
              was not in the agreement. The Alliance Party must be aware that
              the first item on the agenda of the Belfast Agreement was the
              release of all unreconstructed terrorists — terrorists who had
              shown neither repentance nor sorrow for their crimes — and then
              to place the frontmen of those organisations into the heart of
              Government in Northern Ireland and to set about — with the
              complete acquiescence of Mr Trimble and his party — the
              destruction of the force that stood between the decent ordinary
              citizen, Catholic, Protestant, Unionist and Nationalist, and the
              men of terror represented by Mr Adams and Mr McGuinness.</p>

              Mr Trimble and even Mr Ervine, who represents the PUP and who
              fronts the Loyalist paramilitaries, said that Weston Park was a
              bridge too far and that they could not endorse it. Mr Trimble’s
              fingerprints are indisputably on the Weston Park document. When he
              came back he set about one of the demands on the 23-point plan of
              Weston Park; that was Mr Trimble’s part of the deal. The bit
              that he had to implement was to put back in office — by signing
              the necessary papers for the North/South Ministerial Council —
              Mr McGuinness and Ms de Brún. He complied with the British
              Government.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He also sat by while the final nail was put in
              the coffin of the RUC, and he watched the military posts come
              down. Every item on the IRA wish list of Weston Park has been
              gradually fulfilled. Mr Trimble now tells us that he will stand
              against this. If he wants to show the true nature of his
              opposition to this — and this applies to all the Unionists who
              participate in the Executive with Sinn Féin — he can tell the
              British Government that the day they introduce this legislation he
              and his Colleagues and all the Ministers represented in the

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the talks there was a specific clause that
              dealt with the issue of prisoners — prisoners whom some people
              believed were political prisoners but whom others believed were
              representatives of criminality. Nevertheless, there was a specific
              section dealing with the issue. I did a good enough job. I offered
              the people, with all the moral nightmares that it caused, as much
              as they could dare take. The Republican movement is now saying —
              and it has been saying it consistently behind closed doors with
              the British and Irish Governments — that it is not enough. The
              Republican movement is saying that it needs not only to have its
              so-called prisoners on the run returned, without going through due
              process of law — albeit an adjusted process of law to take into
              consideration the abnormality of the society that we lived in —
              but to have a process of inquiries. As the Republican movement
              achieves amnesty, it requires members of the security services to
              step across the hot coals that Sinn Féin and other Nationalists
              have planned for them.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In answer to Sinn Féin’s comment that they
              won’t talk about the security services, I will talk about the
              security services but not, as it was suggested, from an
              anti-agreement point of view. I will talk about them from a
              pro-agreement point of view. Enough is enough. The Good Friday
              Agreement is in trouble, as we all know. One wonders why the DUP
              does not support Sinn Féin when it asks for the return of
              prisoners on the run, because the two issues of amnesty and
              inquiry have the capacity to hole below the waterline all that we
              believed to be possible. I have no doubt about that. It is clear
              that Sinn Féin’s hypocrisy in requiring amnesty for themselves,
              and demanding the full rigour of the law for others, is shameful.</p>

              answer is &quot;You think you are doing badly? Look at the state
              of those Unionists.&quot;</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The process of continued agitation at Unionism,
              aiming at the cracks that exist in the Unionist community, offers
              to Sinn Féin easy pickings from the British and Irish
              Governments. Here is how it works: Unionism demands, Gerry Adams
              offers to supply. Of course, Unionism does not have anything to
              give, so a Government must pay the price. The more in dismay we
              seem to be, the higher the price that Sinn Féin can require. The
              greater the nightmare that we are in, the more the British
              Government believe they have to keep Sinn Féin sweet to get the
              sweeties that will allow at least some Unionists to believe that a
              peace is possible.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In our own hands, therefore, lies the reality
              of how the British Government parleys with Sinn Féin. Push John
              Reid out of the road and start taking these people on face to
              face. The first thing that those of us who believe in the Union
              need to tell them is that there cannot be any more. The Good
              Friday Agreement contains a reasonable enough system, given the
              nightmare that our society has come through, for anyone to step
              forward and be part of the community.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Had you said five years ago to one of these
              guys on the run for a double murder &quot;I’ll tell you what.
              Come you with me — we will go to the barracks. You will go to
              Long Kesh, Magilligan or Maghaberry, and you will probably spend
              six or seven weeks on remand; your trial will be sorted out; you
              will get slapped across the knuckles; and you will serve up to two
              years&quot; — do you know what he would have said? He would have
              said &quot;How do I sign on? How do I get to do that?&quot; If I
              am aware of that, then Sinn Féin is aware of it, but Sinn Féin
              still does not get enough. <i>[Interruption].</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that there will be a degree of silence
              as I speak. I will leave you, Mr Deputy Speaker, with this
              thought. The issue of amnesty versus inquiry can — and will, if
              forced forward — hole the Good Friday Agreement below the
              waterline. Not everyone in the Chamber, perhaps with one
              exception, wants that to happen.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms McWilliams:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There was a large student demonstration
              outside, so I apologise to the House and to those who spoke
              earlier in the debate for my lateness.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My party is concerned that the Alliance Party’s
              motion is an attempt to simplify, unhelpfully, the complicated
              issue of outstanding prosecutions for offences committed before
              1998. The Alliance Party wants to deal with the matter legally,
              but it is not solely a legal issue. It wants to link the issue to
              exiles but not to the wider context of security, law and order,
              political stability and the need for confidence building in a
              community that sorely requires it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No matter how much we might want to put behind
              us the issues of outstanding prosecutions, exiles and continuing
              paramilitary and organised crime, they cannot be dealt with by a
              single wave of the legislative wand. There is no magic wand, as
              those who were involved in the negotiations know. It requires
              negotiation, political will, strong leadership and hard work on
              all sides. To assume that the issue lies at the door of the
              Government or the courts is to focus on one aspect only. That
              assumption betrays a sore misunderstanding of the nature of
              conflict resolution in Northern Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To demand — and it is a simple and foolish
              demand — that some of the &quot;on the runs&quot; should simply
              surrender themselves, approach the courts, admit their guilt, be
              sentenced and then released at the pleasure of the courts, is to
              live in fantasy land. We should know by now how unhelpful it is to
              tie issues together. That merely blocks progress on outstanding
              issues until somebody’s demands are met.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I say to those who would prevent any resolution
              for those on the run until exiles are returned home, and to those
              who refuse to discuss the exiles issue until reforms of policing
              are introduced, that work must be allowed to continue in parallel
              on all those difficult issues. That has been the case to date, and
              it is why we have driven the process forward step by step, dealing
              with the issues in parallel, without making one demand in return
              for another.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We would have had no progress on policing,
              decommissioning, or the devolved Government that we now have, had
              we not adopted that approach, yet the Alliance Party is attempting
              to place another set of chains on the peace process. The origins
              of the proposals for those on the run are the Weston Park talks.
              The proposals were derived from a package of measures, with which
              not everyone was satisfied, as the First Minister pointed out.
              However, we should not take the proposals out of context. The
              agreement contained no explicit provision for those on the run,
              but those people must be dealt with one day. We must face up to
              the issue as part of the peace process, as other controversial
              issues have been faced.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must deal with the deeds of the past. We
              recognise the need for truth and accountability, and there must be
              a proper discussion of the pros and cons of the methods of
              achieving that. However, this is not the time for that debate. We
              urge all the parties to get involved in that process. Local groups
              have begun the process by building on good international practice.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Women’s Coalition is opposed to the
              exclusion and the intimidation of people from their homes. We
              recognise that it is not solely a current problem, it will
              continue for some time. There is no justification for such a
              situation in a democratic society. Reforms have been made to
              provide proper channels to deal with community problems and
              conflicts. However, as with decommissioning, we call on everyone
              with influence to use it to end the practice of exiling people. We
              must focus on practical justice, the justice that results from
              conflict resolution, which involves not only ending violence, but
              ending its causes.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Alliance Party’s suggestion for dealing
              with people &quot;on the run&quot;, which has no precedent in
              justice or in international practice, is an assumption that
              &quot;one size fits all&quot;. It does not, and that concept is
              simplistic. The SDLP’s amended motion acknowledges the
              complexity of the issue and offers much more constructive and
              creative ways to resolve it.</p>

              spirit as a sense of injustice. All those innocent people in
              Northern Ireland who have suffered at the hands of the murderous
              terrorists on both sides, but largely those of violent
              Republicanism, will undoubtedly feel betrayed. They will feel that
              the rule of law has been abandoned if — and this is how the UUP’s
              amendment describes it — the Government’s offer of amnesty is
              permitted to go forward.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.15 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I listened to Mr McLaughlin attempting to
              equate the activities of the security forces with the sort of
              terrorists who are &quot;on the run&quot;. I remind Mr McLaughlin
              and Sinn Féin of the schoolteachers who were dragged out and shot
              in front of their pupils, of the bread servers who were shot as
              they went into shops to deliver their wares, of the people who
              were &quot;sorted out&quot; at Kingsmill — 10 of them, gunned
              down by the IRA because they were Protestants — of Teebane, and
              of the members of the Irish Collie Club who were burnt alive by
              the IRA at La Mon. To talk about the perpetrators of those
              atrocities being engaged in anything that might be described as a
              war under the terms of the Geneva Convention is disgusting.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, that is what Mr McLaughlin offers.
              What he also offers is a threat. Mark this: he tells the House
              that any pursuit of those individuals is fraught with danger for
              the peace process. What does that mean if it is decoded? It means
              that if Sinn Féin does not continue to get its way from a supine,
              abject, appeasing British Government, it might have to sabotage
              the peace process. By whom will it be made fraught, but by Sinn
              Féin, and why? The reason is that Sinn Féin, through thick and
              thin, has managed to retain its weaponry. The real issue is
              decommissioning. The people who threaten the peace process if
              their insatiable demands are not met retain 99·9% of their
              weaponry, Semtex, Kalashnikovs and mortars, yet the leader of the
              UUP prattles on, down the wings of the Assembly, suggesting that
              decommissioning has taken place. Decommissioning will come back to
              haunt the Assembly and the UUP if there is anything remotely
              resembling decency, courage or guts when the Ulster Unionist
              Council meets to hear this man prattling appeasement.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those people &quot;on the run&quot; are
              murderers and psychopaths who did not wish to face justice. It is
              unutterably wrong that the IRA continues to threaten people —
              telling them to leave their homes and warning them that if they
              return they will be murdered — while Mr Gerry Adams, the world
              statesman, the friend of Mandela, the confidante of Cuba and
              Castro parades himself about and claims that it is not the IRA
              that is using bullets, smashing ankles and kneecaps, wielding
              clubs or strapping people like Patsy Gillespie into a car loaded
              with explosives and forcing them to drive to a checkpoint.
              &quot;Oh no&quot;, says Mr Adams &quot;if the community wants them
              back, what has that to do with Sinn Féin or the IRA?&quot;</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Mc Laughlin reached fresh heights of
              hypocrisy today. There was much wisdom in what Mr Ervine said
              today, though I do not often agree with him. It is alleged that
              there will be some sort of truth-and- reconciliation trade-off
              whereby those people &quot;on the run&quot; will be given an
              amnesty. However, there will be no trade-off for those in the
              security forces because wound licking from before 1972 has become
              an art form of Nationalism</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There will be no reconciliation, no forgiveness
              and no peace while people like Mitchel McLaughlin and his ilk
              continue to ply their awful trade in Northern Ireland.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Durkan:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support amendment No 1. The Alliance Party’s
              motion is flawed. I concur with some of Ian Paisley Jnr’s
              remarks. The motion’s proposal that people should have to admit
              guilt before a court, be sentenced and have that sentence
              suspended is unworkable and deeply flawed on several grounds that
              we cannot support.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Amendment No 1 would also correct the motion,
              which misdescribes, in some ways dangerously, the nature of the
              two Governments’ proposal. However, we still recognise the
              proposal for what it is, and we recognise particularly the fact
              that it is beyond the requirements of the Good Friday Agreement.
              Mitchel McLaughlin and members of Sinn Féin know that it is
              beyond the requirements of the Good Friday Agreement. If they felt
              that it was consistent with the agreement, it would be subject to
              judicial review. The two Governments would be taken to court, just
              as the Irish Government have been taken to court for failing to
              release those convicted of the murder of Det Garda Jerry McCabe.
              It is beyond the requirements of the agreement, and that is why it
              was negotiated at the May 2000 talks and subsequently at Weston
              Park.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mitchel McLaughlin also said that Sinn Féin
              was the only pro-agreement party to address the issue and made
              much of the fact that his was the only pro-agreement party to
              bring forward proposals on it. However, he failed to mention that
              Sinn Féin is the only pro-agreement party whose members,
              representatives and officers will actually benefit from the
              proposal. That perhaps suggests why Sinn Féin was so singular in
              its interest and efforts in this area.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The SDLP did not pursue this issue at all at
              Weston Park. Contrary to the impressions given by Ian Paisley Jnr,
              our formal response to the two Governments’ proposals of 1
              August recorded that we had not pursued this issue at Weston Park
              and also pointed out that it was not a provision of the agreement.
              Similarly, we recognised the proposal for a review of the Parades
              Commission as entirely extraneous to the agreement. We are
              completely consistent on all those issues.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At Weston Park, we also paid much attention to
              the need that we saw, and still see, for judicial inquiries to
              deal with serious issues of concern in relation to past cases. We
              concentrated on seeking inquiries for those cases — Sinn Féin
              was concentrating on gaining these benefits for people on the run.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the post-Weston Park package from the two
              Governments, the provision made for those &quot;on the run&quot;
              was the result of a sidebar deal. The Governments also made other
              provisions and commitments. The Governments said that the Weston
              Park package was a take-it-or-leave-it package. It was a
              comprehensive package to ensure the agreement’s complete
              implementation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some parts of the package are moving forward.
              Two of them are entirely extraneous to the agreement: the review
              of the Parades Commission and the proposed amnesty for those
              &quot;on the run&quot;. We have not yet seen other aspects of the
              package that are relevant to the agreement. Paragraphs 21 and 22
              of the Weston Park package of 1 August contained a commitment to
              the implementation group, but we have not seen it. All parties
              wanted it, except for Sinn Féin.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When we pointed out that contradiction to the
              Governments, we were counselled with the observation from senior
              Government representatives that the problem is that our party does
              not have guns. That, as we have pointed out, is a counsel of
              cynicism. People need not be anti-agreement or Unionist to ask
              questions about the management of parts of the process. The
              Governments know where we stand on those issues.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another reason why we particularly commend
              amendment No 1 to the House is that, unlike any of the other
              amendments, it properly addresses the issue of victims. That issue
              should be addressed in a meaningful way.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In supporting amendment No 2 in my name, I wish
              to make some comments. While awaiting the Government’s
              deliberations in the next week or two, several Members have made
              much of their amazement, annoyance or astonishment at the outcome
              of the Weston Park talks and their further implementation. Mr
              Ervine’s comments and those subsequently made by the Deputy
              First Minister almost made me think that after four years —
              eventually — we were getting to the point at which the light was
              coming on. When we give in to terrorists what do they do? They ask
              for more. There is an amazing thing. Many bigots, terrorists,
              arsonists and murderers are members of Sinn Féin. If they are let
              out of jail early they may say OK, but they still want a little
              bit more. Those who designed the deal that got terrorists out of
              jail early then say that they did not mean for it to be like the
              way it is. They thought that when the train was on the track and
              moving in a particular direction it might move slowly and that
              matters would move alongside the train. Now they complain because
              the Provos have jumped on board and want to put in more fuel to
              make the train go faster. All those who constructed the device,
              laid the tracks and put the train on those tracks now say that
              they did not want it to move so quickly. It is a bit late to start
              complaining four years later, as the First Minister has done. He
              waxed eloquently about how he and his party would trenchantly
              oppose all manifestations of the Bill when we see it. If that
              opposition at all resembles the trenchant opposition that I
              witnessed in the House of Commons when dealing with criminal
              justice, when I saw a series of amendments withdrawn time after
              endless time, I await the outcome with bated breath.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy First Minister and Mr Alban
              Maginness referred to a sidebar deal. Part of that means that
              people such as Liam Averill, a double sectarian killer, and Owen
              Carron, a Sinn Féin ex-Member of Parliament, both of whom are on
              the run, will be given an amnesty. A series of other people will
              be let out of jail. One of the First Minister’s points was
              accurate. One option is that prisoners could give themselves up,
              return to jail for a few weeks and then be released. If the second
              option is a complete amnesty, why on earth would prisoners accept
              the first option? He is correct in that respect. Therefore, why
              did he agree in the first place with the concept of early release
              of prisoners in the Belfast Agreement?</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Previous Members who spoke used the term
              &quot;cherry-picking&quot; to refer to the Belfast Agreement. My
              party has never wanted to cherry-pick. It wishes to see the full
              and accurate implementation of the Belfast Agreement. The
              agreement does not include an offer of amnesty, which is why my
              party is opposed to such an offer. The Belfast Agreement clearly
              outlines the terms, and that is why my party wants its full
              implementation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Not only are exclusively democratic and
              peaceful means mentioned on page 1 but the opposition of any use
              or threat of force by others is mentioned. Retained arms, although
              predominantly silent, still threaten. That is why my party remains
              committed to full decommissioning. The Pledge of Office states
              that those in ministerial positions must be committed to</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another aspect that Members referred to is
              mentioned in both the Belfast Agreement and the Mitchell

              McCartney has left the Chamber. I wish that he had stayed because
              I like to exchange views with him eye to eye. The Mitchell
              principles refer to the absolute commitment and total disarmament
              of all paramilitary organisations. When referring to my party, Mr
              McCartney talked about &quot;prattling appeasement&quot;. He
              talked about the real issue of decommissioning. He has said that
              all we need is a mere form of words by which paramilitary parties
              can be treated like democratic parties. I hope that he reads the
              transcript of today’s debate, because he is the hypocrite; he is
              prattling appeasement when he uses phrases such as &quot;mere form
              of words&quot;. If anyone does not believe me, especially Mr
              McCartney, I invite him or her to read the ‘Belfast Telegraph’
              of 1 May 1998, which plainly shows that. I do not accept Mr
              McCartney’s accusation of prattling appeasement. He should take
              the mote out of his own eye before he accuses another Member.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was interested to hear the Minister- in-waiting’s
              speech. He seemed to get carried away, and was under the
              impression that the Deputy Speaker was down here rather than up
              there. As Mr McCartney says, Mr Nesbitt seemed to be slightly
              disorientated.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The DUP amendment goes right to the heart of
              the issue. The early release — or what is now known as an
              amnesty, which is an extension of the early release scheme — is
              a continuation of the Belfast Agreement. During his deliberations,
              Mr Trimble said that the UUP had warned the Government not to go
              down that road. Mr Trimble must have noted that the Government are
              not listening to him. I wonder why the Government would not listen
              to Mr Trimble. Could it be because this is the same Mr Trimble who
              said that the UUP would not negotiate with Sinn Féin before,
              during or after the talks? The UUP did the opposite of what it
              said that it would do. No matter how silly the Government might
              be, that was not lost on them. They realised that to be gored by
              Mr Trimble would have the same effect as being gored by a dead
              sheep.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Nesbitt is trying to make an impact on the
              Minister by ranting in such a way. He does not have to impress us
              by virtue of the fact that he will soon be the Minister. We will
              judge him when he gets into office and we will take him on when
              that day comes. However, he should deal with the real issues now.
              The answer to why Mr Nesbitt and Mr Trimble have no effect on the
              Government is simple, and Mark Durkan let the answer out of the
              bag. He said that the UUP do not have guns. That is the real
              issue. These guys over here have the edge — they have the real
              machinery. That is one of the reasons that my party insisted on a
              full and transparent decommissioning process. When Mr Trimble
              returns to the Dispatch Box, he may wish to note what some of the
              rest of us have noted.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The problem with the process — and it is a
              true process in part — is that it is occasional and partial. It
              is about the recovery of the bodies of the disappeared, a victims’
              commission and inquiries into Bloody Sunday. It might also be
              about the appointment of an international judge to look at six
              cases. However, the problem with all of that is that the process
              is not fully inclusive. Some say that it creates a hierarchy of
              victimhood; others say that it is selective. It leaves few people
              reassured and many embittered. The SDLP amendment is trying to
              move the process beyond being particular, selective and exclusive
              to becoming inclusive and general, and common to all those who
              have suffered grief and pain over the past 30 years.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The principles that inform the SDLP amendment
              — and I welcome Monica McWilliams’s support — are the
              affirmation of those who have suffered, the acknowledgement of the
              wrong that has been done, and the move to greater accountability
              so that out of the pain of the past 30 years can come wisdom
              falling drop by drop upon the heart. That is the purpose of the
              SDLP amendment. If we do not move into that sort of territory we
              will create a hierarchy of victimhood in which many people will
              feel excluded — their grief will not be acknowledged.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This issue more than any other exposes the
              self-seeking agendas of Sinn Féin and the DUP, their double
              standards and their doublethink. While Sinn Féin calls for the
              state to account for its human rights abuses — a state that the
              IRA said it was at war with — they do not call for themselves in
              the IRA to account for the human rights abuses that they were
              guilty of. They call for an amnesty and for no accountability for
              what they did, but they do not apply the same standards and
              principles to what the state did. It is doublethink at a
              preposterous level.</p>

              justice, but it does not agree in principle that the IRA should be
              brought to justice for its actions. On the one hand, Sinn Féin
              calls for those who are exiled in Ireland because they are
              &quot;on the run&quot; to be allowed to come home. However, it
              refuses to accept its responsibility for allowing the return home
              of those exiled outside this island, whom they excluded without
              just cause. Sinn Féin says that it wants to persuade Unionists
              about the future of an agreed Ireland, yet prominent ex-Republican
              prisoners claim that the party should abandon the language of
              oppression, struggle and sacrifice, and call for the language of

              Ireland until the British state acknowledged what it had done to

              for release on licence. Their deeds were public. There was either
              a plea or a finding of guilt, and the release on licence meant
              that those concerned could be returned to prison. I suspect that
              if the Government proposal from the Weston Park communiqué had
              been contained in the agreement, not only might the majority have
              been smaller, but there might not have been a majority at all.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is clear from the Government’s proposals
              that to fail to pursue criminal prosecutions at this stage would
              be tantamount to accepting that a war was fought. It would be
              incredible if the Government were to proceed on that basis.
              Similarly, it would be dubious if they were to proceed with an
              amnesty without ensuring that the paramilitaries who would benefit
              from that amnesty had to lift their threats against others. That
              is why the motion was drafted carefully to set out in the limited
              detail that is possible at this stage a response of opposition to
              the Government’s proposals. It states how those proposals could
              be refined realistically, in the light of the Government’s
              commitment to Sinn Féin that they would proceed on that basis,
              and it inserts a direct linkage between those threatened by
              paramilitaries and the paramilitary organisations that would
              benefit from such an amnesty.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will examine the three proposed amendments. I
              am concerned about the way in which Alban Maginness proposed the
              section of his amendment that relates to the second sentence of
              the original motion. The issue of whether a truth commission would
              be appropriate for Northern Ireland is too complex to be dealt
              with in one sentence. That is why the Alliance Party, in its
              motion, proposed what it regarded as a minimum requirement. It did
              not venture to propose the establishment of a truth commission, a
              possibility that is opened up by the amendment that is proposed by
              Alban Maginness and Mr Attwood.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I acknowledge Alban Maginness’s point that we
              should recognise the hurt of victims, but that is not the purpose
              of the motion. We have considered the needs of victims, and, when
              discussing that issue, we should remember that many will never
              know the details about those who carried out atrocities against
              them or their family members. Therefore, we cannot wrap up all
              victims’ concerns into such a motion. Fundamentally, my
              difficulty with the SDLP’s amendment is the weak, wobbly plea at
              the end that something should be done about exiles. It weakens the
              original motion far too drastically.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The DUP’s amendment was outlined in the terms
              that we would have expected — nothing less from either the
              proposer or his Colleague. Mr Durkan responded to the suggestion
              that the parties that were present at Weston Park are bound by the
              communiqué of the two Governments to &quot;take it or leave
              it&quot;. However, the point merits repetition.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Whatever Cedric Wilson and Ian Paisley Jnr may
              say about that, as Eileen Bell made clear, it is no part of our
              case that we supported the Weston Park communiqué. Some of us
              made our objections to that clear from an early stage.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fundamental difficulty with the DUP
              amendment is that the Prime Minister has already offered some form
              of amnesty. The issue now is whether we can do something to ensure
              that that amnesty does not become an unreasonable, open-ended
              offer, but is dealt with in line with the terms of the agreement.
              It is not whether we should simply say no and know that the view
              of the Assembly if we do say no will simply be entirely overruled
              by the Government.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Ulster Unionist amendment was an
              interesting effort. It seems to be some type of catch-up,
              chronologically as well as everything else, between the Alliance
              motion and the DUP amendment. There is an indication that that
              party has some sort of understanding. I welcome that Mr Trimble
              seems to think that praise was due to the Alliance motion,
              although I confess that I cannot say the same for Mr Nesbitt. I
              could not make out a word that he was saying that was of any
              relevance to either the motion or the UUP amendment — <i>[Interruption].</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must hope that he will improve in the
              future, and we will hear something relevant.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The UUP has dropped any issue of linkage. It
              has dropped any reference to the paramilitary exiles. Given that
              it has made an art form of creating linkages where they do not
              exist, for the UUP to drop a linkage where such a direct linkage
              clearly exists seems to be over the top, beyond anything that we
              would normally expect of that party. There is a direct
              comparability between the two issues. The linkage should stay.
              That is where the fundamental weakness in the UUP amendment must
              be addressed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to mention some other comments in this
              brief winding-up speech for a long debate. I noticed that Mitchel
              McLaughlin believes that the motion takes a lopsided approach.
              Should he wish to bring forward a motion welcoming all those
              aspects of Weston Park that dealt with inquiries and so on, I have
              no doubt that he would be welcome to do so. Those points were
              dealt with by David Ervine and Mark Durkan. There is no doubt that
              Sinn Féin was the only party that had associates who were likely
              to benefit from the motion.</p>

              who have been killed getting on and alighting from school buses by
              motorists. It calls on the Executive to conduct urgently an
              investigation into measures to safeguard the welfare of our
              children when using school buses, taking into account the relevant
              laws introduced in the United States.</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am pleased to have the opportunity to bring
              this motion to the Assembly. It is an important issue. Given the
              number of accidents, at least two of which in the past three
              months have had tragic consequences, the debate is timely. The
              loss of a child, in any circumstances, is a tragic and traumatic
              event, and I want to be sensitive to the emotions and feelings of
              those who have lost children.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The safety of children while travelling on
              school buses, especially when boarding and alighting, has been a
              matter of concern to me, and I know that other Members share my
              concern. Several months ago, the Committee for the Environment
              published the findings of its inquiry into the transportation of
              children travelling to and from school. I acknowledge the
              Committee’s work and commend it for the detailed consideration
              that it gave to such an important issue.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I recognise that the issues that my motion
              addresses are the responsibility of various Ministers, including
              the Minister of Education and the Minister for Regional
              Development. The Department of Education is responsible for policy
              on school transport, and the Minister for Regional Development
              would be responsible for changing the road traffic regulations to
              allow school buses to operate as they do in the American system.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister of the Environment for his
              presence today. I look forward to his response to the points that
              will be made in this important debate. As everyone is aware, this
              is Mr Foster’s last appearance as Minister of the Environment. I
              pay tribute to him for the priority that he has given to road
              safety since he took office. Most importantly, as regards the
              motion, he moved rapidly to increase the number of road safety
              education officers. As Chairperson of the Education Committee, I
              am aware of the excellent work that road safety education officers
              do with young people in schools and other places. That was the
              clearest demonstration of the Minister’s commitment to the
              safety of our children and young people, and I congratulate him
              warmly on it.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister was also responsible for a major
              increase in road safety advertising. The House will be aware of
              the high-impact campaigns, many of which addressed young people.
              Those campaigns have done much to change attitudes and behaviour
              and to raise the profile of road safety. They have also addressed
              the principal causes of death and serious injury. The Minister’s
              personal commitment to making our roads safer has been evident to
              all. I congratulate him on his performance as Minister of the
              Environment and for the courteous and accessible way in which he
              carried out his duties.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion urges the Executive to take the
              necessary action. This is a cross-cutting issue, the
              responsibility for which does not fall to only one Minister. In
              order to achieve satisfactory progress, the Executive will be
              required to take a co-ordinated and cohesive approach, involving
              not only the Department of the Environment, but the Department of
              Education and the Department for Regional Development.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Almost 300 schoolchildren were injured
              travelling to and from school last year. Of those, 76 were
              passengers on school buses and 100 were pedestrians. The category
              of pedestrians includes pupils who had just alighted from or were
              about to board buses. Everyone will agree that those figures must
              be reduced and that we must do our utmost to improve children’s
              safety.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Research in the United States shows that three
              times as many deaths occur when pupils are boarding or alighting
              from school buses as occur when they are the occupants of buses.
              As a result, the National Academy of Sciences of the United States
              of America states that children are at a greater risk of being
              killed when boarding or alighting from a school bus than at any
              other time. It also states that more school bus safety efforts
              should be directed towards improving the safety of children when
              boarding and alighting from buses.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1992, the National Highway Traffic Safety
              Administration (NHTSA), which is part of the US Department of
              Transportation, published guidelines on pupil transportation
              safety. Those guidelines established minimum recommendations for a
              state highway safety programme for pupil transportation, including
              the identification, operation and maintenance of school buses used
              for carrying students. It also made recommendations for the
              training of passengers, pedestrians and cyclists. The NHTSA
              recommends that each state in America should have a comprehensive
              pupil transportation safety programme and that a single agency for
              the administration and collation of safety data be established.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The guidelines also recommend that each state
              enact legislation to provide for uniform procedures regarding
              school buses stopping on public highways for the loading and
              unloading of children, and that public information campaigns
              should be conducted regularly to ensure that the driving public
              understands fully the implications of school bus warning signals
              and requirements to stop for school buses that are loading or
              unloading children. Standards have also been published that
              establish requirements for safety devices to be installed on
              school buses to improve pedestrians’ safety when they are close
              to the stopped school buses. The purpose of those standards is to
              minimise the likelihood of any vehicles passing a stopped bus and
              injuring nearby pedestrians.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In practical terms, the guidelines recommend
              that all school buses be clearly identifiable: they are usually
              painted a bright glossy yellow, which is the worldwide symbol of
              road safety. School bus drivers should receive training on
              unloading and unloading procedures, and education programmes have
              been created to teach children how to board and alight from school
              buses safely. In Kansas, those programmes are introduced at the
              start of each school year and repeated regularly throughout the
              year as a reminder.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">School bus drivers should give a clear warning
              signal that they are about to stop the bus to allow children to
              alight or board by flashing amber lights that are clearly visible
              to other motorists. When the bus stops, red lights should flash
              and an extended arm safety device should be activated to indicate
              that the children must not cross immediately in front of the bus.
              The guidelines also recommend that when the school bus is stopped
              and the red lights are flashing, other motorists should be
              required to stop at a safe distance from the bus, regardless of
              the direction in which they are travelling.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although the National Highway Traffic Safety
              Administration has no authority to require states to adopt those
              guidelines, several states have enacted appropriate legislation.
              For example, in New York, not only must motorists not pass a
              stationary school bus, but when picking up or dropping off
              passengers who have to cross the public highway, the bus driver
              must instruct such passengers to cross in front of the bus while
              the driver keeps the bus halted with the red signals flashing
              until such passengers have reached the opposite side of the
              highway. Motorists are prohibited from overtaking a school bus
              when it is stopped and the penalty for doing so is a considerable
              fine, penalty points or a spell in jail. There are various methods
              by which that is enforced in other American states.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members may also be aware of a project in
              Staffordshire in England where a local authority’s yellow school
              bus fleet is claimed to be a resounding success in cutting
              congestion and taking children to school safely.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have outlined measures being taken in the
              United States to improve school bus safety and, in particular, the
              efforts being made to improve the safety of school bus loading
              zones when children are boarding and alighting from buses. It is
              clear that school bus safety in the United States is regulated to
              a much greater extent than in Northern Ireland, and I understand
              that other countries such as Australia and New Zealand are basing
              proposals on the American experience. In its report, the Committee
              for the Environment recommended that urgent research be undertaken
              into the potential for new legislation prohibiting other road
              traffic from passing school buses, and a 1999 report on school
              transport made similar recommendations in the Republic of Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Surely it is about time that we took action to
              address the matter seriously. We can learn from the American
              experience. We can put measures in place to make travelling by
              school bus safer. Therefore, I urge the Executive to introduce
              several pilot schemes in rural and urban areas to assess the
              impact that the prevention of overtaking school buses while
              children are boarding or alighting would have, and to see whether
              such legislation would be suitable for application here. I commend
              the motion to Members.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As expected, many Members have indicated that
              they wish to speak in the debate, and for that reason I must limit
              all those who wish to speak to five minutes. I must also advise
              that it may not be possible to call everyone who wishes to speak.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Five minutes would not be enough time for me to
              go into the matters on which my Committee gave me authority to
              speak.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The opening speech referred to Members knowing
              that today would be the last appearance by the Minister of the
              Environment. Members do not know that. If an announcement has been
              made, it has not been conveyed to me as the Chairperson of the
              Committee for the Environment or to the members of that Committee
              that there is a new Minister of the Environment. If that is the
              case, it would be more appropriate if the relevant Committee were
              told properly, or told in the House, rather than a Member making
              an announcement on behalf of some anonymous individual.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I must add that I support the motion with some
              hesitation. I wish to put on record that anything that contributes
              to children travelling more safely to and from school deserves the
              unequivocal and wholehearted support of the Assembly. However, I
              must draw the attention of the House to matters relevant to the
              timing and content of the motion.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no need for the Executive to conduct
              an investigation, as suggested, into the welfare of children and
              school transport because the Committee for the Environment has
              already dealt with that matter comprehensively.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Committee spent more than a year carrying
              out a thorough inquiry not just into the safety of children
              getting on and off school buses but into every aspect of school
              transport safety. The Committee considered submissions from 57
              groups and individuals. It took oral evidence from 13 different
              sources, including the leading Departments and the Royal Ulster
              Constabulary, and it employed leading specialist transport
              consultants to assess critically and contribute to its findings.
              The report was published and was in Members’ hands in September
              2001.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several of the Committee’s 28 recommendations
              relate directly to the motion and are relevant to some of the
              points made by Mr Kennedy. Page 26 of the report deals in some
              length with the issue of children boarding and alighting from
              buses, and the Committee recommended, among many other matters,</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;that the Department of the Environment
              should undertake urgent research into the potential for new
              legislation in respect of other road traffic passing vehicles that
              have school bus signs deployed&quot;.</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee made several recommendations,
              which were highlighted in its report. I do not have the time to go
              into those recommendations in this debate. I wrote to the Minister
              and his Department on several occasions regarding the report, but
              it was not until the eve of this debate that a contribution was
              received from the Department of the Environment. Up until then,
              the Committee received little or nothing of substance from the
              Department. Indeed, last Thursday, at the request of my Committee,
              senior officials from the Department of the Environment appeared
              before the Committee to bring Members up to date on the progress,
              or lack of progress, that had been made with regard to the report.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unfortunately, it transpired that their brief
              was short, and it was indicated that it may be at least four
              months before the Department will get round to appointing an
              official to look at the report’s key recommendations in any
              depth. Even then, it is intended to recruit outside consultants to
              advance the work.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Committee’s despair and frustration will
              be appreciated. I inform the House of that, because as far back as
              October last year we requested that major revenue be made
              available to implement some of the recommendations. Up until now,
              we have not received a substantial response. However, we shall
              demand one. If it is Mr Foster’s final appearance as Minister
              today, make no mistake about it — my Committee will be demanding
              that the new Minister take action on the issue, because we have
              not had action to date.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Time has run out, but there are many other
              things that I would like to have said on behalf of the Committee.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><a href="#top">TOP</a></p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for the
              Environment (Ms Lewsley):</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion. I do not need to tell the
              House that the safety of our children is of paramount importance,
              and issues such as a safe means of transport to and from school
              deserve priority. Safety when boarding or alighting from buses is
              not the only issue — on-board safety and the proximity of bus
              stops to children’s homes are also important. We all want to
              keep our children safe, and we all have a responsibility to do
              what we can to prevent accidents and, as has been mentioned this
              afternoon, deaths.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Increased traffic is already a problem on our
              roads, and a drive is under way to encourage people to make more
              efficient use of public transport. To do so, parents must be
              assured that their children will be safe on the journeys to and
              from school and that there will be adequate supervision to prevent
              accidents when boarding or alighting from buses. Parents must also
              be assured that safety measures will be in place when their
              children are travelling on the buses. As a member of the Committee
              for Education we considered several measures, including the use of
              seatbelts; the abolition of the &quot;3 for 2&quot; seats; lights
              and signage on school buses; new legislation to either prohibit or
              severely reduce the speed of traffic overtaking school buses; the
              design of drop-off and pick-up points; supervision at road
              crossings; and the yellow bus system used in the United States.
              All those measures have the potential to reduce deaths or
              casualties, but each has a cost. All would help to protect the
              safety of children using transport to and from schools.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As has been mentioned by the Chairperson of the
              Committee for the Environment — the Committee of which I have
              recently become a member — the school transport inquiry report
              showed that the cost of installing seat belts is estimated at
              £180 million, which includes £40 million in recurrent costs. Can
              we put a price on a child’s life? In its presentation to the
              Committee last week, departmental representatives talked about the
              benefits of preventing road casualties. In economic costs, a death
              was equal to £1 million. A sum of £1 million would compensate no
              parent for the loss of a child.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Safety on school transport is a classic example
              of an opportunity for interdepartmental co-operation. It could
              involve the Department of Education, the Department for Regional
              Development and the Department of the Environment. However, that
              co-operation is not apparent because costs appear to be given a
              higher priority than children’s lives.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Road safety education programmes are important
              to increase awareness of safety issues. It is vital that the safer
              routes to school initiative be expanded and delivered to all
              schools across Northern Ireland. We must ensure that our
              Administration delivers for young people. Its effects would be to
              encourage good practice, improve the co-ordination of transport
              services for children and emphasise the user of a public service
              rather than the provider.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McHugh:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I
              support the motion, and I welcome the presence of the Minister of
              the Environment and the Minister of Education. The safety of
              children on school buses involves our road system and many
              Departments, including Education and Environment. The matter has
              been close to the hearts of the members of the Education Committee
              for some time. We asked for action on this issue. The House’s
              attention has been drawn today to the Environment Committee’s
              report, which was issued last year and on which no action has been
              taken. That must be changed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with Ms Lewsley that nothing is more
              important than the lives and welfare of our children. Action is
              vital. I am not sure that £140 million would be needed to install
              seat belts, but we should start that process. Seat belts are very
              expensive, but the lack of seat belts has not caused the deaths of
              children. Deaths occur mainly when children are boarding or
              alighting from buses, and mostly outside the bus, rather than when
              travelling on the bus. Seat belts would not be so very expensive.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Bus stops are a major danger zone. Passing
              vehicles kill or injure children leaving a bus stop or boarding a
              bus. The Department of the Environment alleviated that problem
              recently by providing space for buses at the sides of busy roads
              to allow traffic to continue while children board buses.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">More work must be done to find out what system
              we should use. The Environment Committee has done much good work
              in gathering all the information; there is enough evidence
              available for action to be taken.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is the possibility of a new collegiate
              system of schooling. That will require more transport for
              children. There are fewer children now, and that may necessitate
              the closure of some schools. That would oblige children to travel
              greater distances to the nearest school. The emissions from the
              additional buses will create an environmental problem.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Educating the public, children and bus drivers
              to the fact that children cannot tell the speed of oncoming
              traffic is important. Drivers seem to think that children know the
              speed that drivers are travelling at, and children seem to think
              that drivers see them, when it is obvious that they do not. Seeing
              a child at 20 metres can be the first sight that a driver has of a
              child leaving the front of a bus, and that can have serious
              consequences.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is also the issue of the speed of drivers
              passing buses, and that is where the yellow bus scheme in America
              comes into its own. Anyone driving at more than 30 mph has a 90%
              chance of causing death. When speeds are reduced that percentage
              drops considerably. It has been shown that speed is an important
              factor. The American system is better than a system of flashing
              lights. A study in Tasmania has proved that flashing lights do not
              slow traffic — motorists will only slow down if they face
              penalties. Flashing lights may help, but it is almost necessary to
              stop traffic passing a bus when children are alighting or
              boarding. It is as simple as that. Go raibh maith agat.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McCarthy:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Mr Kennedy for moving this motion. I am
              also pleased that both Ministers are here.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also share the concern expressed by Mr McCrea,
              the Chairperson of the Committee for the Environment, that his
              report has been gathering dust since September. Why has action not
              been taken? The report prepared by the Committee is detailed,
              informative and comprehensive in every way. I give full marks to
              the members of the Committee.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not so happy with the response from the
              Department of the Environment. Why has it taken so long to respond
              to the various concerns of the Committee? Surely a report provided
              by any Committee deserves to be taken seriously and acted on,
              especially when it involves such a serious matter as protecting
              the lives of our schoolchildren. I understand that Translink and
              the education boards have responded, but the Department of the
              Environment has not.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I made a written submission to the Committee,
              as did Ards Borough Council. We concentrated on four main themes,
              which were included in the Committee’s report along with several
              others, and were among the many recommendations made to the
              Executive.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the motion says, we need immediate measures
              to safeguard our children when using school buses. I have four
              main worries. First, I am concerned that the use of a double seat
              by three children is allowed. We must adopt a policy of one seat,
              one child. Secondly, on the question of seat belts, an inequality
              already exists in that private bus operators are, rightly,
              required by law to have seat belts on every seat, whereas public
              transport operators are not. That is grossly unfair, and I believe
              that there should be seatbelts for every seat on all our buses.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thirdly, I support fully the policy of
              prohibiting standing on school buses. How can we ask for seat
              belts for all passengers and then allow standing? That is
              unacceptable. My fourth area of concern was highlighted by the
              presentation made to the Committee by the Women’s Institute of
              Northern Ireland. Mrs Lyttle, from Portaferry in my constituency,
              who is chairperson of the international Women’s Institute, made
              a good case for immediate safety improvements on the buses for all
              schoolchildren. Like myself, the Women’s Institute was deeply
              touched by the death on the main road between Portaferry and
              Kircubbin in 1998 of a child who had just got off a school bus to
              visit his grandparents. Unfortunately, a passing car struck the
              youngster, who was fatally injured. In my opinion, another young
              life was lost unnecessarily. There have been other incidents in
              which fatalities have occurred.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must support the proposals of the Portaferry
              Women’s Institute to achieve improvements in safety for
              youngsters getting on or alighting from a bus. Stopping the
              traffic has been suggested and was included as a recommendation in
              the Committee’s report. I understand that in some countries, the
              traffic is stopped in both directions. That must be looked at
              immediately.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The 28 recommendations contained in the report
              of the Committee for the Environment must be taken seriously and
              acted on as soon as possible. Otherwise, we will continue to have
              tragic accidents like the one that occurred outside Kircubbin in
              my constituency a few years ago. Surely every Member in the
              Assembly wants to avoid such a repetition. I support the motion,
              and I hope that the full report will be brought to the Assembly in
              due course and the 28 recommendations acted on immediately.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Morrice:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I acknowledge the work of the Minister and, on
              his departure, I congratulate him on the work that he has done and
              on his commitment to road safety. I know that he made changes for
              the better. I will always say that it will never be enough — but
              I would say that. I urge the Member who takes the Minister’s
              place to make the issue of road safety a top priority. The
              permanent secretary promised the Public Accounts Committee that
              that would be done.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I urge the new Minister to treat road safety as
              the top priority issue. I do not want to go on at length because
              everything necessary has been said about buses, road safety and
              the potential for following the example of the United States.
              There are interesting examples in the different states.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.15 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome and support the motion
              wholeheartedly. We have learnt from the Chairperson of the
              Committee about the relevant report, of which I am aware. I would
              not knock the fact that the motion has been tabled, as Members are
              all in this together. If a Member decides to table a motion to do
              something about a report that is sitting on a shelf, that is all
              the better, given that it is for the safety of children. It does
              not matter, therefore, who says it or when it is said, as long as
              it has the goal of saving lives. Every effort must be made to make
              buses, roads, and public transport in general, safer for our
              children.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to touch on the issue of ministerial and
              departmental responsibility for road safety. My Colleague, Ms
              McWilliams, recently took a delegation from the Saintfield Road to
              meet the Minister for Regional Development, Mr Peter Robinson, to
              bring to his attention the dangers for children on that road. She
              had a constructive meeting, and she is hopeful that a pelican
              crossing will be put in place. I am using that as an example,
              because the problem is in knowing which Minister and which
              Department to go to.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Kennedy, in his opening remarks, asked who
              covered the issue. In this case, the Department of Education, the
              Department of the Environment and the Department for Regional
              Development all have a role. It is too fragmented with regard to
              which Department has responsibility for ensuring action. That is
              an inappropriate way to deal with such an important issue. I urge
              the Executive to give the matter serious consideration and to
              bring road safety under one roof.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to conclude by quoting a figure that I
              have stated on many occasions, because I am an advocate of road
              safety. It is a figure that is still startling even when it is
              repeated — 150 road deaths per year in Northern Ireland, which
              is higher than the United Kingdom average, and 12,000 casualties
              per year. Patricia Lewsley has spoken about the human cost and
              that goes without saying, but 12,000 road casualties a year costs
              the economy £450 million a year. That shocks me every time I say
              it. When we seriously start to prioritise road safety we will not
              only save lives, we will save money. However, lives are much more
              important. I support the motion and hope that something is done
              promptly.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Gallagher:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Every day over 100,000 children use transport
              in different parts of the North. It is a useful facility for both
              parents and children. It is helpful towards children’s learning,
              and it widens opportunities and choice for parents. Unfortunately,
              as the motion states, there are accompanying dangers. Sadly, from
              time to time they involve the loss of young lives.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Already this winter two children have lost
              their lives when, according to the reports, alighting from school
              transport vehicles.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Two aspects of school transport vehicles have
              been mentioned by other Members: the provision of seatbelts and
              regulations such as the &quot;3 for 2&quot; seating rule. Both
              these received attention in the Committee for the Environment’s
              report, and I hope that work will continue.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have to understand that the facts show that
              most fatalities around school transport occur when children are
              alighting from school buses, so areas where children are either
              boarding or alighting from school buses need particular attention.
              School buses include those provided by the boards, those provided
              by Translink and the privately owned buses that do school
              transport runs on contract from the education and library boards.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How recognisable are school transport vehicles,
              especially when children are boarding or alighting? I support
              strongly the idea of having better warning lights fitted on all
              school buses to improve the visibility of the vehicles and to draw
              the attention of passing motorists to the fact that children are
              boarding or alighting and are somewhere around the bus. In my
              constituency of Fermanagh and South Tyrone there was a fatality a
              couple of weeks before Christmas. A 14-year-old child had got off
              a bus, and it had moved on, but as she crossed the road to get to
              her home, an oncoming car hit the child. From the reports I
              understand that there was no fault with the school bus driver,
              with the operation of the bus or with the driver of the oncoming
              vehicle, who was unfortunately caught up in the accident. That is
              why we must think about how we warn passing motorists of the
              dangers to children around that time.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also support a cross-departmental approach
              involving the Department for Regional Development, and, again, I
              call for the gritting of all school bus routes in winter. That
              would make an important contribution, as would the provision of
              parking areas where buses could pull in off a main road to allow
              children to get on and off. Although children get road safety
              education in schools, this is so important that the Department of
              Education should make sure that in the interest of their safety,
              children get specific education about personal safety and school
              transport.</p>

              <b>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One issue is sure to provoke the same degree of
              concern and frustration at the same time of the year, each year,
              and that is the overcrowding of school buses and the safety of
              pupils travelling by bus. Problems have risen at the start of
              every term over the past few years and continue to affect many
              school routes across the Province. Every September for the past
              five years we have had horror stories of over 100 children being
              squeezed onto school buses every morning and of pupils being
              bypassed because buses are overcrowded. Although there has not
              been a serious accident yet because of this, the potential for
              injury to passengers remains at an unwarranted high.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unfortunately, the lives of many children have
              been claimed, and many serious injuries have been sustained as
              pupils have alighted from school buses. In almost every instance
              it has been impossible for the driver of the overtaking vehicle to
              take evasive action when pupils step out into their path.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One area of local life which the Assembly has
              the power to address and improve is the overcrowding of school
              buses. The reason for that is twofold. The main one is that
              legislation currently classifies 13-year-olds as children and
              allocates three such children to a double seat on school buses,
              but children of that age are just too big for that. To compound
              the problem, pupils have school bags, kitbags, hockey sticks and
              art folders with them, which often have to be set on the floor
              because of insufficient storage space, making it difficult for
              standing passengers. A change in the legislation is, therefore,
              essential to deal with the problem, as more buses are needed to
              carry children to and from school.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Therein lies the second problem: Translink will
              only provide the transport that the local education board pays
              for. In the past four years, lobbying has failed to make any
              progress on that matter, with the education boards claiming that
              no problem exists. It is inevitable that more transport will have
              to be provided, as it is only a matter of time before there is a
              serious accident. Translink representatives, although
              co-operative, say that they are only fulfilling their legislative
              obligations and that, as things stand, they cannot provide further
              transport or safety measures.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no excuse for packing buses full of
              schoolchildren and no reason for legislation’s not addressing
              children’s safety when alighting from school buses. I am gravely
              concerned about the safety of children using the school bus
              service, including those attending Glastry College, Comber High
              School and Regent House in my constituency. Their safety does not
              get sufficient priority and, again, it is only a matter of time
              before serious injuries are sustained.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the publication last September of the
              Committee for the Environment’s report into school transport. I
              am glad that the public inquiry found in favour of many of the
              proposals requested by interested groups and organisations. Most
              encouraging was the recommendation that serious consideration be
              given to the use of hazard lights on school buses. There is an
              argument that cars and other vehicles should be prevented from
              overtaking school buses that slow down and stop to allow children
              to alight, and that also display the new signage.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another encouraging factor was the proposal to
              abolish the &quot;3 for 2&quot; seating arrangement, which
              stipulates that three young people should share a seat constructed
              for two adults. Children today are taller and bigger than children
              used to be, and they carry more equipment and coursework with them
              to school. It is too much to squeeze three children onto one
              double seat. I am glad that the Committee has called for the
              implementation of the one-seat-for-one-pupil policy and that
              legislation that permits children to stand on school buses is
              being phased out. All pupils should be entitled to a seat.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other recommendations such as those that call
              for improved liaison between schools and service providers,
              misbehaviour and vandalism to be addressed, a reduction in the
              baggage carried by children on buses and the development of a new
              and enhanced road safety education programme are to be welcomed.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is merit in the argument that the
              Executive should have taken action on this before now, and the
              recommendations of the Committee for the Environment should have
              been acted upon decisively. It is to be hoped that a more

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support many of the recommendations contained
              in the Environment Committee’s report. It is legal for dozens of
              schoolchildren to stand in school buses, which not only puts them
              in danger but obscures the driver’s view when he checks his
              mirror. The provision of seat belts and illuminated school bus
              signs is important. The American model of good practice has been
              examined, and another model of good practice exists in Germany,
              where the emphasis is placed on information for car drivers, with
              motorists educated about the likely patterns of behaviour of
              schoolchildren in traffic.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Iris Robinson made a good point about the
              problem being worsened by the heavy school bags that children must
              carry. In India there are restrictions on the number and weight of
              bags that children should be expected to carry. If those limits
              are exceeded, the school is fined. The web site of the North
              Western Health Board in Donegal contains advice on school bag
              safety.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are united in our hope, expectations and
              prayers for the safe journeys of schoolchildren. When they leave
              home in the morning, the last thing that anyone wants or expects
              is an accident. The subject is made pertinent by the recent death
              of Julie Meldrum in Fermanagh, which other Members mentioned.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am aware of the time restrictions, but I will
              refer to the Department for Regional Development’s safer routes
              to school initiative. I welcome the western division of the Road
              Service’s provision of two lay-bys and attendant footways at
              Slevin’s Crossroads at Tattyreagh near Omagh. Those works are
              being completed on the main Omagh to Fintona road as a result of
              lobbying and a site meeting, which my Colleagues and I initiated
              about two years ago as part of the safer routes to school
              initiative. A near-fatal accident occurred there just over 10
              years ago.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The development of the safer routes to school
              initiative by the Department for Regional Development is
              important, but the approach to the issue must be joined up. The
              statutory walking distance of two miles for primary schoolchildren
              and three miles for post-primary schoolchildren must be relaxed,
              and that is a particular problem in isolated rural areas. Last
              week, I lobbied for the provision of safe transport home for a
              post-primary school pupil who is dropped off in a forested rural
              area 2·8 miles from her home. She is expected to walk home
              between 4.00 pm and 5.00 pm in winter through a forested region.
              All those initiatives are important, as is a joined-up approach.
              Rumble strips should be added to roads. Flashing lights should be
              added to buses, and they could also be erected outside schools and
              timed to warn motorists when children are arriving at, or leaving,
              school.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I commend the motion and any action that
              concentrates the mind of the Ministers responsible for the matter.
              I wish Mr Foster all the best and congratulate him on the good
              work that he has done as Minister.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr A Doherty:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a dedicated and slowly maturing
              Back-Bencher, I associate myself with Members’ tributes to
              Minister Sam Foster. He is a man of great experience, integrity
              and wisdom, and I know that he will continue to give excellent
              service, perhaps in a more relaxed fashion, to the Assembly and to
              his constituents.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I commend the Member for his motion. It takes
              account of the strong feelings expressed throughout the community
              that the safety of children travelling to and from school is a
              matter of the greatest importance.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is also a confirmation of the importance of
              the exhaustive process of consultation on the subject by the
              Committee for the Environment. That resulted in the publication of
              the ‘Report on the Inquiry into Transport Used for Children
              Travelling to and from School’, which contains many
              recommendations aimed at maintaining a safer environment for our
              children.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I may be going over ground covered by the
              Chairperson. However, perhaps it is a good thing that, on this
              issue at least, we are singing from the same hymn sheet. The
              Committee’s report has been doing the rounds in the relevant
              Departments for some time. The Department for Regional
              Development, the Department of Education, and the Department for
              Employment and Learning have responded appropriately.
              Unfortunately the lead Department, the Department of the
              Environment, has not been so forthcoming. This is surprising,
              given the Minister’s undoubted and very strong commitment to
              road safety. However, feet are being dragged, perhaps because of
              the cost or the complexities of such long standing and neglect. A
              start must be made — and the sooner the better — before the
              tragedy that is &quot;waiting to happen&quot;, happens.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I must refer to one departmental reaction to
              the last part of recommendation 1 in the report — the need to
              carry out a regulatory impact assessment</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;to evaluate the potential costs and
              likely benefits of making changes&quot;.</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is a proper and inevitable step. It seems
              to me that the Department is reluctant to set things in motion
              because of the waves that might be created, either because certain
              recommendations would be considered essential but prohibitively
              expensive, or because the benefits would be too little to justify
              the expense.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the specifics of the motion, I
              suggest that the Executive have ready access to a great deal of
              the information that an investigation might discover. Much of what
              is needed is to be found in the Committee’s report — for
              example, in recommendations 8 and 9, which deal with effective
              school bus signs and warning lights. Recommendation 12 considers
              the possible benefits of a dedicated school bus system, like the
              American yellow buses. Recommendation 14 deals specifically with
              action to reduce the risks of boarding and alighting from school
              buses. No doubt there are additional or alternative actions that
              could be taken. However, those measures would be a good,
              affordable start.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Drivers have an awesome responsibility. They
              must appreciate, or be taught, the importance of self-restraint
              and patience. A car in motion is a terrifying weapon when it comes
              into contact with fragile flesh. Motorists must be made aware of
              the power that they have to kill, maim and cause distress and
              anguish to their neighbours. They must learn self-restraint and
              consideration in every situation, all the time. If they do that,
              everything else will be easy.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Shannon:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am surprised to see the motion being tabled,
              bearing in mind that the Committee for the Environment has
              supported some new measures yet, as other Members have said, its
              report has been sitting on the shelf gathering dust for a long
              time. The Committee saw the need to put preventative measures in
              place. However, no action has been taken to respond to that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion because it deals with
              children’s safety, something that many Members have been
              involved with since their earliest days in politics. The issue is
              of particular importance and interest to me because at least two
              children in my constituency have been killed in the past few years
              while alighting from buses on their way to and from school. It is
              an issue that school boards of governors, of which many of us are
              members, are also concerned about. As the father of three young
              children, I am conscious of the need for child safety.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, children are a law unto themselves,
              especially when they are not supervised or are in a crowd. When
              they mess about and try to impress among a crowd of their peers,
              they forget about the dangers that their parents constantly warn
              them about. Children do not always pay attention when they are
              fooling around. Unfortunately, when this behaviour is teamed with
              a bus and a busy road it can become a fatal combination. The bus
              driver is responsible for the children’s safety until they
              descend from the bus. However, there has never been an extra adult
              present to supervise the children as they get on and off the bus.
              Bearing in mind the exuberance of children, that seems to be the
              one truly preventative action that would help them be more
              obedient and well behaved when travelling to and from school.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have no illusions that school buses are as
              chaotic and full of mischief as they were when most of us
              travelled on them. The driver of the bus has his or her work cut
              out just driving the bus, let alone trying to control the children
              or to see where they get to once they get off the bus. One way to
              remedy that is for another responsible adult to be on the bus to
              keep the peace and, more importantly, to supervise the children as
              they get on and, especially, off the bus. The obvious rebuttal to
              that is that it will cost money. With the education budget under
              strain, many will say that it cannot be done. However, what price
              is a child’s life?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Kennedy mentioned the relevant American laws
              regarding school buses. I am in favour of many of those because in
              America buses deliver 75% to 80% of children to either school or
              home. The Department could look to the Community Transport
              Association to ascertain the initial cost of setting up such an
              operation. Something must be done to protect our children from
              accidents caused by misadventure.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">School buses in America are fitted with four
              sets of lights. Strobe lights make drivers aware of the presence
              of a school bus, even in poor visibility. Buses also have loud
              horns, similar to those found on lorries and large vehicles, that
              sound when reversing. All those adjustments have been made purely
              to save lives, and have been effective. Something similar must be
              put in place in Northern Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the most innovative American laws is
              that traffic on both sides of the road must stop when a school bus
              is pulling in to let children on or off. That law alone would
              prevent children from being knocked down, and thus injured or
              killed, because all traffic on the street would come to a complete
              standstill.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The law lets a child enjoy his or her trip to
              and from school, but it does not prevent the odd lapse in
              concentration that has been fatal in the past. The problem with
              the law is that it works if there is a system of special school
              buses. In Northern Ireland, school buses are not specially
              identified. They must be altered to distinguish them from other
              buses.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The sentiment of the law is ideal, but its
              implementation will require not only buses being identified as
              such, but police officers keeping those who flout the law from
              harming children. However, the police do not have sufficient
              numbers to patrol the streets of Northern Ireland let alone
              enforce new laws that will benefit our children and keep them
              safe. More police officers should be available in the Province to
              educate schoolchildren in road safety. The Belfast Agreement has
              reduced the number of police officers, and there are very few left
              to give our children those life-saving talks.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Something is needed to keep our children safe.
              We must talk to American schools and learn how their children have
              benefited from the new measures that were put in place to protect
              them from being killed when going to and from school by bus. We
              must investigate what has been done in Australia, France and other
              European countries. We must investigate the best way to safeguard
              our children because, as we all agreed, something must be done. We
              cannot afford to have another child injured or killed.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr S Wilson:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, I will make two observations. The House
              will note the irony that it took a member of the Ulster Unionist
              Party to drag the Minister here to talk about some of the issues
              that the Environment Committee had been trying to get him to talk
              about for, apparently, four or five months.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, it is nice to hear that members of
              Sinn Féin, according to Gerry McHugh, now believe that there is
              nothing more important than the lives of children. I am sure that
              many families have wished over the past 30 years that that lesson
              had been learnt a long time ago.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to ask a couple of questions about some
              of the issues that have been raised. We must put the issue of
              school transport in context. Mr Gallagher said that, every day,
              there are over 110,000 journeys to and from school. Over a school
              year, that works out as 36 million journeys. Danny Kennedy said
              that there are 300 accidents per year. That puts the degree of
              safety with which children are delivered to school in context. All
              those who are involved should be congratulated.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.45 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several issues have been raised today. Some of
              them require minor changes to be made to bus stops; others require
              extensive expenditure. For example, several Members referred to
              the seat belt issue. To fit seat belts in all buses would require
              the purchase of many extra buses. The capital costs of that would
              be about £125 million, and the additional running costs, which
              would be paid to the education and library boards, would be
              another £40 million. Put in context with the £46 million that is
              currently spent on school transport, it amounts to an increase of
              100% each year. Although I agree that we must ensure that
              youngsters are delivered to school safely, it would have been
              useful if Members who spoke about that measure had suggested what
              proportion of the Budget they would use to facilitate it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must bear in mind that to put seat belts in
              buses does not guarantee that youngsters will use them. Should
              extra staff be employed? Should teachers travel on buses to ensure
              that seat belts are worn? Some of the proposals that have been
              suggested raise as many questions as they provide solutions.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has been mentioned that when a bus stops to
              allow children to alight, traffic coming from the rear and the
              front should be stopped. We do not have dedicated school buses. It
              is often impossible to tell whether a bus is carrying ordinary
              passengers or youngsters. The buses could be fitted with lights.
              However, given the location of many bus stops, does that mean that
              drivers, who may be travelling at 30mph or 40mph should realise
              that there is a school bus ahead, and stop and wait until it moves
              off? Some investigation must be done into the road safety issue of
              cars suddenly stopping in the middle of a road. That is what often
              leads to accidents in which cars ram into other cars.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another suggestion was that people could be
              employed to supervise at bus stops. That is an admirable idea, but
              have the resource implications been considered? To introduce a
              no-standing policy on school buses would cost £22 million to
              provide the necessary additional buses.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would have liked to have heard some ways in
              which those issues could be resolved. Perhaps there will be some
              answers in the winding-up speeches.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Could you, Mr Wilson? Thank you very much
              indeed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have been honoured and privileged to serve
              the Assembly. I thank all concerned for their help, co- operation,
              kindness and courtesy during my time as Minister. I wish my
              successor every success in his new role.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have always been a believer in the old maxim,
              &quot;moderation in all things&quot;. Even in our belief that our
              individual wisdom is the way in which the world should perform, it
              is sometimes lax in the reactions of those whose task it is in
              life to offer instant opinions on all things great and small. No
              section of the community has all the virtues or all the vices.
              Most people try to do their jobs as best they can, even if they
              are not always successful. He who has never failed to reach
              perfection has the right to be the harshest critic. However,
              criticism is good for people in public institutions. In a
              democracy, no institution can expect to be free from that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No one has a monopoly on care and wisdom. I am
              a father, a grandfather and a former professional childcare
              worker. I am aware of the need for love, care and protection of
              the person and property, and so too are the staff in the
              Department of the Environment. The Department’s staff have a
              role to perform, and they are aware of that when they appear
              before Committees. It would be helpful if Committee members spoke
              with departmental staff rather than at them when they appear
              before Committees to answer questions.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I listened with great interest to Members’
              contributions. All right-minded people share their desire to
              reduce the number of deaths and serious injuries on our roads. I
              have devoted much of my efforts as a Minister to pursuing this
              objective and have made road safety my top priority. I am spurred
              on by the knowledge that nearly all deaths and injuries on the
              roads are avoidable. Most are the result of human error, such as
              carelessness, inattention, excessive speed, alcohol consumption,
              by pedestrians and drivers, and the failure to wear seat belts.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The avoidable death or injury of a child is
              particularly tragic. I speak for all Ministers, especially the
              three Ministers with responsibility for road safety and school
              transport, when I say that we will continue to do what we can to
              improve our Departments’ response.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly will appreciate that my
              departmental responsibilities are confined to overall
              co-ordination of the road safety strategy, road safety education
              and publicity, and vehicle and driving standards. The Department
              of Education is responsible for policy on school transport
              provision, and the Department for Regional Development is
              responsible for road traffic regulations governing the operation
              of school buses and other traffic. In the context of that division
              of responsibility, I will read extracts from the responses of the
              Department of Education and the Department for Regional
              Development to the Committee for the Environment’s school
              transport report as set out in the composite response that I sent
              to the Chairperson of the Committee yesterday. It is a response to
              the recommendation for the provision of a dedicated and segregated
              school bus system, similar to the yellow bus system in the United
              States</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;In DE’s view this is, in effect, a
              recommendation that pupils should be transported on a contracted
              and/or ELB service which should also be available to non-entitled
              pupils. There would have to be a two tier system with paying and
              non-paying passengers. There would also be implications for the
              public transport system as many of the Translink bus routes serve
              both the public and pupils and it would go against the concept of
              an integrated transport strategy.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The Department of Transport, Local
              Government and the Regions in Great Britain recently announced a
              number of pilot schemes to test the effectiveness of these yellow
              buses. Pilot trials have been delayed while the manufacturers
              revise the design to accommodate European requirements. It is
              hoped that the trial will now proceed in the early part of 2002.
              While the Department will discuss with DRD the merits of
              undertaking pilot schemes here, it would seem more appropriate in
              the DE’s view to await the outcome of the trials in England
              before pursuing this recommendation.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department for Regional Development’s
              response was as follows:</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;DRD is concerned that the establishment
              of a segregated school bus system would have a serious adverse
              impact on the viability of considerable parts of the stage
              carriage network, particularly in rural areas. It is likely that
              the loss of patronage from school children would reduce fare
              income on many services to such an extent that Translink would
              have no option but to withdraw such services. This would be a
              serious blow to DRD’s objective of promoting the use of public
              transport. Because of this and also due to lack of resources, DRD
              is not prepared to pilot the use of Yellow Buses.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As regards the proposal for several pilot
              schemes to assess the impact of preventing vehicles from
              overtaking school buses when children are boarding and alighting,
              Mr Kennedy has already acknowledged that the Environment Committee’s
              school transport report recommended that research be carried out.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In response to the Committee, the Department
              for Regional Development stated:</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Research into the potential for new
              legislation in this area is the responsibility of DRD Roads
              Service transportation unit to investigate. DRD will examine the
              issue, discuss with the DTLR and report back to the Committee on
              its findings.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I now turn to the issue of child road safety.
              First, I thank the Member for his kind remarks when opening the
              debate. I have sought to do what I can within the programmes for
              which I have responsibility, and I appreciate the sentiments that
              have been expressed by many Members about my efforts on road
              safety issues.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although Northern Ireland does not have the
              type of dedicated and segregated school bus system that is used in
              the USA, it is nevertheless reassuring that the safety record of
              buses and coaches in Northern Ireland is good. In the four years
              from April 1997 to March 2001, 131 children, aged between four and
              15, were killed or seriously injured on Northern Ireland’s roads
              while travelling to or from school. Six of the children killed and
              93 of those seriously injured were pedestrians. One of those
              killed and 18 of those seriously injured were car passengers. Six
              of the children seriously injured, but none of those killed, were
              bus, coach or minibus passengers. Buses are, therefore, a
              relatively safe form of transport for children, compared to
              travelling on foot or by car, and that is further supported by the
              fact that more children travel to school by bus than by car.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, I must emphasise that although the
              number of children killed or seriously injured as pedestrians in
              the vicinity of buses is not separately identified in police
              statistics, road safety practitioners, schools educational
              authorities, parents, police and all involved in road safety
              widely recognise such areas as being danger zones. Child behaviour
              in and around bus stops when going to and coming from school is
              widely accepted as requiring attention from all road safety
              authorities.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A key area in addressing that problem is road
              safety education in schools, and I will outline what my Department
              currently does in that field and our plans for new initiatives.
              The Assembly is already aware of the additional resources that I
              was able to secure in the 2001-02 Budget to increase the number of
              road safety education officers from 11 to 21 from last May. Those
              officers provide valuable support for schools through the annual
              provision of over £650,000 worth of road safety teaching
              materials suitable for different age groups. Among those materials
              is the road safety teaching aid calendar that is provided to every
              nursery and primary school classroom in Northern Ireland. The
              calendars are used as a classroom teaching aid throughout the
              school year, and they feature guidance on behaviour when
              travelling to school by bus and advice on how to cross the road
              after getting off the bus.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The increase in the number of road safety
              education officers will allow the introduction, from October, of
              practical child pedestrian training in support of classroom
              training at various primary schools, mainly in areas of social
              deprivation. Research indicates that children from deprived areas
              are more likely to be involved in a traffic collision than other
              children.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although the work of the road safety education
              officers is being targeted particularly at schools in those areas,
              my Department has an overall objective of ensuring that every
              school in Northern Ireland is visited at least twice a year. In
              2002-03 it is expected that officers will make over 4,000 school
              visits.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other work by road safety education officers
              that is relevant to child road safety includes: cycling
              proficiency programmes in schools, which train 10,000 children
              each year; working with post-primary schools to deliver courses on
              road traffic studies — approximately 160 post-primary schools
              offer formal traffic studies as a timetable subject, with 71
              schools offering the courses as a GCSE subject known as motor
              vehicle and road user studies; organising visits by theatre groups
              to schools as part of a road safety education programme; and
              working with older pupils to encourage more responsible attitudes
              to their behaviour as road users as they reach driving age.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Department’s publicity campaigns,
              targeting the major causes of road casualties — excessive speed,
              alcohol consumption by both drivers and pedestrians, and failure
              to wear seat belts, are also relevant to child road safety,
              including the home-to-school journey.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Included in my Department’s initial response
              to the Committee for the Environment’s report on school
              transport is a commitment to consider further how to increase
              children’s awareness of the dangers that they face when
              travelling to and from schools — as pedestrians and when
              boarding, or alighting from, school buses. Equally importantly, my
              officials are also considering ways of increasing drivers’
              awareness of the danger that they pose to child pedestrians,
              especially in the vicinity of school buses.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">6.00 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In developing these proposals, we will be
              working closely with the Department for Regional Development in
              the context of its safer routes to school policy, and with the
              Police Service of Northern Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Department is also working with the
              Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety on a major
              new proposal, using part of my allocations for 2002-03 and 2003-04
              from the Executive’s new directions fund. For the first time in
              Northern Ireland this will involve the introduction of a children’s
              traffic club. Similar clubs have been very successful in Great
              Britain.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The children’s traffic club provides the
              parents of every three-year-old with six free road safety books,
              at three-monthly intervals, as part of a structured and tailored
              introduction to road safety for parents and young children. All
              this documentation will integrate with information they will
              receive later at playgroup and primary school.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is my objective that, through these
              interventions, children and other vulnerable road users will be
              made more alert to the dangers they face on the road, and that
              drivers and riders will associate buses with a critical danger
              area for children and adjust their driving accordingly.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I now turn to the Environment Committee’s
              inquiry into school transport. I read some of the coverage of what
              was said to my officials when they gave a presentation to the
              Committee last week, and I am glad to have this opportunity, on
              the Floor of the Assembly, to refute some of that criticism. It is
              true that the Committee has only now received a formal response
              from my Department. This was due in part to a desire to be helpful
              to the Committee by producing a composite response. We wanted to
              collate the views of all those interested in the report, including
              the Department of Education and the education and library boards,
              as well as the Department for Regional Development and Translink,
              rather than send a piecemeal response. Clearly I now have to
              wonder if that effort was misplaced.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Moreover, it would not be true to suggest that
              there has been no dialogue with the Committee since the report’s
              publication in September 2001. The report’s four key
              recommendations on &quot;3 for 2&quot; seating, standing, seat
              belts, and signage and new lights have significant public
              expenditure implications, which have been mentioned. Expenditure
              could amount to over £180 million in capital costs, and over £60
              million per year thereafter in recurrent costs.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wrote to Dr McCrea in October 2001 to remind
              him of these implications and the potential impact on the nature
              of public transport provision. I wrote to Dr McCrea again in
              December 2001, seeking the Committee’s view on the extent to
              which there was objective evidence from its investigations that
              road safety benefits commensurate with those additional costs are
              likely to be available. There has been nothing but silence since.
              I also asked from which Executive budgets the millions of pounds
              needed to implement the Committee’s recommendations might be
              taken — perhaps health, housing, or education? Nothing but
              silence again.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This brings me to a serious point about the
              nature of public office. It is clear that many who spent the years
              of direct rule championing every populist cause that came along
              have found it difficult to adjust to the realities and
              responsibilities of devolution. Emotive slogans about the value of
              a child’s life, or about disasters waiting to happen, are not a
              basis for good policy or responsible decision-making. We all,
              Executive Ministers no less than others, treat child road safety
              with the utmost seriousness. To suggest otherwise is deeply
              offensive. While I know that one cannot put a price on the life of
              a child, and I speak as a parent and grandparent, as a Minister
              who has to operate as part of an Executive with a finite budget
              —</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is the last time I shall address the
              Assembly as Minister of the Environment, and it is fitting that
              the topic on this occasion has been road safety. During my time in
              office I have made this my top priority. I have been saddened by
              every death and serious injury that has occurred. I have worked to
              obtain additional resources in this vital area and to support the
              work of other Departments and the police in their road safety
              efforts. I hope that the additional effort we have been able to
              put in on education, public awareness, and generally raising the
              public profile of road safety, will result in long-term dividends
              in reducing the death and injury on our roads.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I end by thanking all in the Executive and in
              the Chamber who have supported me in these efforts — even those
              who have sought to spur me on with barbed remarks. I wish my
              successor well in the task that lies ahead — not just on road
              safety but on the whole challenge of the Department of the
              Environment portfolio. I look forward to supporting him from the
              Back Benches.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Kennedy:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have had a useful exchange of views, and I
              place on record my thanks to all the Members who have contributed.
              I thank the Minister of the Environment for his presence, and I
              also acknowledge the presence of the Minister of Education.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What we have heard will, and can, be the basis
              for early progress on this important matter. I hope that will be
              so. It was my objective in bringing the motion to the House. Many
              Members made important points in their contributions. Dr McCrea,
              as Chairperson of the Committee for the Environment, said that his
              Committee’s report had made several key recommendations and that
              it can be the basis from which to move forward. It would have been
              helpful if he had presented his report on behalf of his Committee
              to the Assembly earlier for wider debate. That possibility
              remains, and I hope that he will consider that to be appropriate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was grateful to Patricia Lewsley, who
              referred to the loss of a child and to the fact that that cannot
              and ought not to be calculated in monetary terms. Likewise, we
              must acknowledge that there are measures that cost comparatively
              little which could be implemented at an early stage. Indeed, Mr
              McHugh referred to lights that can be attached to school buses and
              vehicles.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was heartened by the support from Mr McCarthy
              and the Portaferry Women’s Institute, of which presumably he is
              not a member, though it is obvious that he takes on board their
              sensible views on this. Jane Morrice made the important point that
              saving lives is what we should be about. She also pointed out the
              cross-cutting nature of this and how it affects the work of the
              Department of the Environment, The Department of Education and The
              Department for Regional Development. Mr Gallagher rightly said
              that it is most dangerous when pupils are alighting from school
              buses, and statistics and research in America bear that out. Iris
              Robinson highlighted the overcrowding of school buses, and as the
              Chairperson of the Committee for Education and a local
              representative I am very aware of that. Constituency
              representatives are concerned about how best to address that
              problem urgently and effectively.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McElduff welcomed the consensus on the
              safety of schoolchildren and referred to other models of good
              practice in places such as Germany. It might be important to
              engage in research to see if we can make and improve sensible
              recommendations. Arthur Doherty, with his customary modesty,
              misplaced I must say, welcomed the motion. He was very much
              singing from the same hymn sheet as Dr McCrea, and that was an
              interesting duet. Mr Shannon rightly paid tribute to the school
              bus drivers. It was never my intention to criticise school bus
              drivers. We all know the contribution that they make to the safe
              passage of children.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr S Wilson, with his customary and legendary
              style, rather overestimated even my ability to drag a ministerial
              Colleague, or a party Colleague, to the Assembly to chastise him
              in some way. However, he helped tease out many important issues in
              this debate — the cost issues and some of the practical
              outworking. That was an important contribution. We will be wise to
              look carefully at all the proposals. By all means, we should study
              the other models of good practice, whether in America or in other
              parts of Europe, but we would be wise to look closely at the
              practical outworking of that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister gave us a detailed response. I
              thank him for that and for his commitment shown and proved to road
              safety issues during his stewardship of his Department. He will
              have a continuing interest in that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am heartened by the collective view of
              Assembly Members that, between the Executive Departments that have
              some responsibility in this, progress can be made, proposals can
              be formed and legislation can be brought forward soon to improve
              and further enhance the safety of the children who attend our
              schools. I am grateful to all those who participated and thank
              them for their excellent contributions.</p>
