                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Speaker. At the last
                sitting before Christmas, the hon Member for North Down, Mr
                McCartney, left his seat, came to this side of the Chamber and
                was involved in an altercation with my Colleague Mr Close and
                me. At the time, and on a point of order, I said that I had been
                assaulted, but I did not realise that a point of order could not
                be taken during a Division.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to inform you and the Assembly, since
                there has been a degree of interest, that shortly after the
                incident Mr McCartney apologized to me for his behaviour. I have
                accepted the apology in the spirit in which it was offered, and
                I consider the issue closed. I realise that it would have been
                proper to raise this in Mr. McCartney’s presence, but he was
                only in the Chamber for a few minutes yesterday, and I did not
                want the matter to hang on any longer than this.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am grateful to the Member for clarifying
                the matter. I did not see the altercation though I understand
                that there was something of the kind. I am glad that in the rosy
                glow of the Christmas period the matter has been so amicably
                resolved between the two Members.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us hope that if peace has broken out in
                that context, it is a presage of greater things to come.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That this Assembly calls on the Minister of
                Higher and Further Education, Training and Employment to take
                immediate steps to address the problem of skill shortage in
                Northern Ireland, particularly in the field of health and social
                services.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister of Higher and Further
                Education, Training and Employment and the Chairperson and the
                Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for being here. The purpose
                of the motion is to stimulate debate on the situation that
                exists. It is about looking forward to the future and developing
                a strategic plan to ensure that the public and private sectors
                will have their needs met by the training and employment that we
                provide so that we will be in a much better position to
                encourage inward investment and safeguard the jobs that already
                exist in Northern&nbsp;Ireland. I made particular reference to
                health and social services in the title of my motion, and I know
                that some of the skill areas that I want to touch upon are not
                directly the responsibility of the Minister. However, it is
                something into which the Minister of Higher and Further
                Education, Training and Employment has an input, along with the
                Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have been informed by my local health trust
                that there is a chronic shortage of speech and occupational
                therapists. People who have suffered strokes wait over a year to
                see an occupational therapist. We have been told that money is
                available to employ them, but there is a shortage of such staff
                due to the limited number of university places for occupational
                therapists. There is also a limited number of university places
                available for speech therapists, approximately 20 to
                25&nbsp;places each year. The waiting list arises because a
                large percentage of the people who are trained are women. They
                enter the profession, but when they have children they sometimes
                wish to job-share. According to the Homefirst Community Trust,
                they are statistically more likely to work part time when they
                have families. That should be facilitated in whatever way
                possible, but there must be a strategic approach to deal with
                the matter. In the Homefirst Community Trust area there are 100
                health visitors, and only one is male. We could do more to
                promote these occupations as valuable and worthwhile to
                encourage more men to join them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to move on to the needs of industry.
                On 15&nbsp;December&nbsp;2000, the Minister announced the
                introduction of access bursaries and the abolition of tuition
                fees in certain skilled areas such as the software, engineering,
                electronics, manufacturing and hospitality industries. That is
                an innovative approach, and it is only the beginning. In future,
                we would like to encourage people to become involved in areas in
                which we have identified shortages. I do not see the point of
                continually training the same number of people as in previous
                years. We need to focus that training in areas in which it is
                most needed. We need to identify where our industry wants to be
                in five, 10 and 15 years’ time and plan to produce the
                graduates and other qualified people whom we need. Academic
                qualifications are important, but vocational qualifications are
                equally so.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr McClelland] in the
                Chair)</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are talking about building new houses.
                Thousands of new homes are needed each year, and it is important
                that we have skilled craftsmen available to build them. We are
                talking about projects such as new railways, and, again, we must
                have the skilled craftsmen capable of carrying out those
                infrastructure improvements that we want in Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To build a better and fairer society for
                everybody here, we must try to improve access for people who
                live in areas of social and economic need. We need to get more
                people coming forward from areas of high unemployment to ensure
                that the entire Northern Ireland economy becomes prosperous,
                rather than just areas such as east Antrim, west Tyrone, and
                south Down. To do that we need to focus on working with other
                Departments in the Administration. However, that will only
                happen if we have a workforce that is highly skilled
                academically, and, through the further education colleges,
                vocationally. I welcome the measures already taken by the
                Minister in that regard.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am sure that Members will wish to touch on
                many other issues, and I will be glad to listen to them. I again
                thank the Minister for the measures that he introduced on 15
                December. That was a first step, but it is not the end of the
                road. We need to adopt a more holistic approach to ensure that
                it is not just Government Departments and the public sector that
                have their needs met in future. Our industries must have their
                needs met too so that they can expand, employ and help Northern
                Ireland to become a more prosperous place for us all to live in.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Higher and Further
                Education, Training and Employment Committee (Dr Birnie):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First of all, there is the general issue of
                skills shortages, to which Mr O’Connor rightly referred. I
                will comment on that first because it lies entirely within the
                responsibility of the Department of Further and Higher
                Education, Training and Employment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The departmental Committee welcomes the
                efforts that are being made in that area, particularly by the
                Training and Employment Agency. These include the setting up of
                the skills task force in recent years and, more recently, the
                creation of the priority skills unit in the Northern Ireland
                Economic Research Centre (NIERC). These are designed to pinpoint
                areas in the economy in which, as Mr O’Connor said, there may
                be a deficiency in skills.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">10.45 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Northern Ireland needs to be aware — and I
                think the Training and Employment Agency shows awareness of this
                — that there are various international models that show how we
                could work out what gaps exist between the types of labour
                skills being demanded and the types being supplied. One such
                model is associated with the Netherlands economy and another
                with the Belgian economy. Northern Ireland, as a small regional
                economy, should pay careful attention to international best
                practice. I am agnostic on which international model on the
                identification of skills gaps should be used in this case. We
                must continue to review the evidence.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee has an ongoing inquiry relating
                to this area, which, in part, the motion refers to. It is our
                intention to bring a report to the Assembly in due course. We
                have already received over 90 written submissions from a range
                of private and public bodies on training for industry, which
                indicates the importance of the subject and the level of
                interest that there is. At the moment, the Committee is taking
                evidence from representatives from business organisations,
                private employers, the community education sector, further
                education, higher education and other relevant groups.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At this stage, it is not possible for me, as
                Chairperson, to report on the findings of the Committee. Much is
                being uncovered which is of interest, and we hope to report
                later this year. I suspect that the commentator John Simpson was
                correct when he argued in the ‘Belfast Telegraph’ recently
                that if we define IT skills broadly, there is a shortage of
                skills in that area.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to make three points on a
                related matter. First, there is clear evidence of an
                underprovision of basic skills. A reputable international survey
                suggests that about one in five adults in Northern Ireland —this
                is sadly a personal and economic tragedy and scandal — is
                found in the lowest category of literacy skills. The common test
                often used is the ability to read the instructions on a medicine
                bottle. Clearly, that could literally be a matter of life and
                death.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sadly, because of past failings in education,
                around 20% of the Northern Ireland population have not been
                adequately schooled to read such relatively basic text. In that
                context — and the Committee has previously made this
                submission to the Minister of Higher and Further Education,
                Training and Employment and to the Minister of Finance and
                personnel — we were disappointed with the relatively small
                increase for basic adult education in the recent Budget. We
                would like to see further resources given there, perhaps through
                the medium of the Executive programme funds.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, there is the matter of skill
                shortages in general. The Northern Ireland economy increasingly
                demands high, specialist and sophisticated skills. This demand
                coexists with an increase in the level of so-called economic
                inactivity — persons who have completely withdrawn from the
                labour market for a variety of reasons. We also continue to have
                too many pockets of long-term unemployment, and all that is
                notwithstanding the undoubted achievement in the economy in
                lowering the average level of unemployment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thirdly, given changes in the labour market,
                family life and in the working and structure of the economy, the
                provision of training needs to be increasingly flexible —
                hence the emphasis on life-long learning, something which I am
                sure that the Committee entirely welcomes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many Members will agree that there is,
                perhaps, a problem with the way in which the motion has been
                worded. With the exception of a limited number of undergraduate
                courses at the University of Ulster that relate to some health
                service occupations, the provision of skills for the health
                sector is the responsibility of the Minister of Health, Social
                Services and Public Safety. Therefore, although I agree with the
                sentiments behind the motion, the wording should have reflected
                that fact.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is evidence of insufficient labour
                supply in some parts of the health sector. Figures suggest a
                shortfall of up to 800 nurses and a need for more occupational
                therapists, GPs and senior specialists. I want to make two
                points about the provision of skilled health workers. First, for
                the UK as a whole, statistics suggest that the number of health
                personnel — be they doctors or nurses — per capita is low
                compared to the number in most other Western societies. Even if
                we were to fill the current gaps in the system, it could be
                argued that there would still be insufficient provision for
                health care, especially preventive care. That raises broader
                questions, which go beyond the scope of the debate and the remit
                of the Department and relate to the level of funding for health
                care and the methodologies used. Can we continue to rely simply
                on tax-based health care provision, or should we consider other
                models from Europe and the Western World? It is a controversial
                issue, which goes beyond the powers of the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We talk about shortages of health personnel,
                but that may be only a convenient shorthand term to describe
                what is happening. The problem is not so much one of supplying
                trained medical staff from universities and colleges, but of
                retaining those graduates, particularly in hospitals in outlying
                parts of the Province. No doubt, other Members will give
                examples of particular hospitals.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy Chairperson of the Higher and
                Further Education, Training and Employment Committee (Mr Carrick):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee is grateful to Mr O’Connor
                for tabling the motion and focusing the House’s attention on
                the subject.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The underlying sentiment in the motion is
                that finding the correct approach to training for industry is of
                fundamental importance. On that depend our well-being and
                prosperity, and it is critical to a successful and healthy
                economy. It is vital that Northern Ireland be able to compete
                globally. A direct correlation between labour supply and demand
                is critical to the success of the economy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Higher and Further Education, Training
                and Employment Committee has considered how training and
                education can measure up to the needs of industry. The Committee
                has taken evidence from business, education, training and church
                interests, from community and voluntary groups and from
                commentators in that field. They have told us that we need
                skills urgently. The emphasis is on &quot;urgent&quot;. Speed is
                of the essence.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have received evidence of problems with
                basic skills, including transferable skills, and finding and
                retaining skilled workers. That evidence has already been placed
                before the Committee. That is not to deny either the obvious
                strengths of our education and training systems or the innate
                ability of our people. However, we do have a tradition of
                exporting skills, which means that almost everywhere you look
                throughout the world, in whatever sector, people from Northern
                Ireland are contributing at all levels and in the forefront of
                medical, technical and social advances. In the past, that
                outflow of people resulted, in part, from the troubles. We all
                hope that in the future more of our young people will prefer to
                remain in Northern Ireland to study, work and bring up their
                families.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The export of skills does not indicate an
                oversupply of skills here. Locally, there are both perceptions
                and well-documented evidence of skills shortages, including
                transferable and specialist skills.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to basic skills, the Training and
                Employment Agency reported in 1997 that one fifth of the 9,000
                or so young people who entered Jobskills — the main vocational
                training programme — required training in basic literacy and
                numeracy. That is astounding, if not appalling. The correlation
                between the lack of basic skills and unemployment is well
                documented, as is the linkage with people at risk of social
                exclusion or involved in antisocial behaviour. Such low levels
                of literacy and numeracy among our young people must be a cause
                for concern to us all.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How can we work towards ensuring that our
                young people do not get trapped in a spiral of low expectations,
                underachievement and exclusion? Is the quality of jobs on offer
                adequate to give people a decent standard of living, job
                satisfaction and self-pride, things to which everyone aspires?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We cannot be complacent because of the
                current record low levels of unemployment and the increases in
                the rate of productivity. Northern Ireland’s productivity
                continues to be lower than that in the rest of the United
                Kingdom, despite recent increases in the rate of growth. It is
                questionable whether skill deficiencies have any significant
                affect on our firms’ productivity.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.00 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, skill shortages add to the pressures
                on business. In a recent CBI survey, almost one in three firms
                said that their current workers lacked advanced IT or software
                skills, and 17% reported a lack of necessary managerial skills.
                While these skills can often be provided through a combination
                of workplace training and education, most businesses will look
                to the established education and training providers to foster
                the skills that they need.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was disappointed to learn that, compared to
                the rest of the UK, small businesses in Northern Ireland
                recorded higher than average levels of dissatisfaction with the
                availability of suitable labour and the relevance of available
                training courses. In a recent independent survey conducted for
                the Federation of Small Businesses in Northern Ireland, only 17%
                were satisfied with the relevance of locally available training
                courses, while 50% were dissatisfied. While fewer than 30% of
                the respondents were satisfied with the levels of literacy and
                numeracy in the workforce, almost 40% were dissatisfied.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I set that against the strong evidence heard
                by the Higher and Further Education, Training and Employment
                Committee from the colleges of further and higher education
                about their desire to work with employers to provide the right
                skills at the right time. Clearly, something has gone amiss. The
                Committee also heard evidence from the skills task force, which
                has identified an agenda of urgent actions to address immediate
                skills shortages in priority areas. We are keen to support its
                determination to be proactive, to target resources more
                effectively and to pre-empt mismatch between skills supply and
                demand.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That requires a co-ordinated approach across
                Government. For example, it means that we need to be satisfied
                with the curricular approach to basic skills, including
                communication skills, teamworking and other transferable skills,
                which prepare people to make a contribution to the workplace. It
                also means that we need to target the areas of adult education
                already referred to by Dr Birnie — both basic education and
                progression — so that those who are not fulfilling their
                potential are supported and encouraged. Equally, it means
                looking at both individual and group incentives, so that a
                co-ordinated approach to full employment is adopted and
                followed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Much more could be said, but I want to bring
                my remarks to a close. The Committee will report on this at a
                later stage. I reiterate the determination of the Committee for
                Higher and Further Education, Training and Employment to report
                to the Assembly on the contribution of education and training to
                meeting the skills needs of industry. There is much important
                work in this area for the Assembly to pursue, and we welcome the
                opportunity given to us by Mr O’Connor to flag up these
                issues.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr J Kelly:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh míle maith agat, a LeasCheann
                Comhairle. I support the motion and thank Mr O’Connor for
                bringing it to the Assembly. It is an important matter that
                needs our attention and that of the Minister.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A recent small business survey found that
                there was 55% dissatisfaction with the availability of suitable
                labour, 39% with literacy, 38% with numeracy and 50% with the
                non-availability of relevant training courses. We need a
                strategic plan that takes account of the current labour force,
                looks at unemployment patterns and long-term unemployment and
                provides for future economic objectives.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The whole area is complex and not something
                that one would expect either the Minister of Health Social
                Services and Public Safety, or the Minister of Higher and
                Further Education Training and Employment, to address with
                immediacy, but it must be addressed in the longer term.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A recent CBI survey of May 2000 on human
                resources found that 23% of firms faced problems finding craft
                and skilled employees such as carpenters, mechanics and
                electricians. Higher electronics are the trendy skills — I
                think that the term is &quot;sexy&quot;. However, carpenters,
                bricklayers, and electricians are also critical to the future
                development of the economy, and those skills require close
                attention. For example, a man in a small firm, working with
                perhaps two other employees, finds it difficult to take on an
                apprentice on a day-release basis. When a young fellow of 18 is
                taken on to serve his time as a carpenter, an electrician or a
                brickie, within 18 months he will be doing a tradesman’s job
                but not getting a tradesman’s wages. That is the economic
                situation. Therefore we need to look closely at the traditional
                skills of carpenters, bricklayers and electricians.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The survey also showed that 20% of firms find
                it difficult to recruit sales and marketing employees. That is
                another area that we need to address. Eighteen per cent reported
                problems with finding managers and senior administrative staff,
                with 16% unable to recruit IT staff. Those figures came from the
                CBI in 2000. It is fine to become fixated on information and
                communications technology (ICT), but we must pay attention to
                other areas of work as well.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Supermarkets employ young people who do not
                have any transferable skills or knowledge and are perhaps the
                lowest paid in the economy. We must address those problems too.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The situation in the Health Service is more
                complex. The commitment of staff in a massively underfunded
                health care system must be applauded, but auxiliaries and nurses
                are not paid enough. The lure of trendy jobs in the media or ICT
                is draining many further and higher education students away from
                medicine and nursing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is also the problem of the constant,
                negative reporting, fuelled by many Members. That does not make
                the Health Service an attractive workplace. It is kept
                functioning by the hard work and commitment of staff, and the
                simple truth is that the chronic underfunding and lack of clear
                planning and decisiveness by successive British Ministers have
                had a massive detrimental effect on it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The latest figures show that between the
                trusts and the private sector there is a shortage of some 600 to
                800 nurses. With regard to doctors, in 1998 Dr Brian Patterson
                reported that in 1993 there were 120 applicants to fill 45
                vocational training posts, while in 1997 there were only 40
                applicants for the same number of posts. That is an indication
                of the decline in the Health Service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr O’Connor’s motion raised the problem
                of a skill shortage. We know that, with regard to nursing, it is
                critical. Nurses are being drafted in from the Far East to fill
                the vacancies in a country where nursing was once considered one
                of the prime vocations for young women and, increasingly, young
                men.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is also the question of nursing degrees
                and the extra training required. Nursing has become more
                complex, and many health establishments are looking for young
                women and men with a nursing degree. Completing the four-year
                course can be difficult for young people, and the Minister
                should address that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have only one burns surgeon in this part
                of Ireland. Recently, we faced a crisis in that sector, because
                that man was about to leave. It is intolerable that we have only
                one person to look after a burns department, and that problem
                too must be addressed. We all know from our daily constituency
                work that there is a waiting time of up to six months for people
                wishing to see an occupational therapist. Old people are waiting
                for six months to get heating or treatment, because of the lack
                of occupational therapists. The shortage of medical laboratory
                staff and scientific officers, likewise due to the running down
                of the Health Service over the past 30 years, should also be
                addressed urgently.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is evidence of massive skills shortages
                in the health sector. Perhaps it is unfair to lump it all on to
                the Minister of Higher and Further Education, Training and
                Employment, but I must raise the issue. The Minister should get
                together with the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public
                Safety to address the issue of skills shortages. The Minister
                has attempted to address the issues, but I urge him to take more
                cognizance of the matters that have been raised this morning.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Health, Social
                Services and Public Safety Committee (Dr Hendron):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I congratulate Mr O’Connor on bringing the
                motion before us today. We have a massive skills shortage,
                particularly in the Health Service, and Members will not be
                surprised if I confine my remarks to that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Health Service faces two major problems.
                The first is the gross underfunding of recent years. Indeed, the
                Prime Minister last July accepted that the percentage of gross
                domestic product spent on the Health Service in the UK is lower
                than that spent in most developed European countries. The second
                point — and it has been made by many Members and recently
                forcefully by Ken Maginnis — is that the Assembly and the
                Executive should look at the organisation of the Health Service.
                Plans are afoot for that, and the sooner the better. The whole
                system, Department, trusts and boards, must be examined.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Figures from the Department show that, last
                year, there was a shortage of 300 to 400 nurses in the trusts
                and a similar shortage in the independent sector. I did think
                that the figures would be even higher than that. Newly qualified
                nurses are offered attractive pay and benefits packages abroad.
                Can we blame them for taking up those offers?</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.15 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, some initiative has been taken.
                Nurses have been recruited from Australia and the Philippines,
                some of whom have been placed in the Royal Victoria Hospital and
                the Ulster Hospital. Many of these nurses are skilled — and
                that is what this is all about — but in one case a young
                cardiac surgery nurse from the United States did not know how to
                take a patient’s blood pressure when she was asked by a
                surgical registrar do so. That is not a criticism of the nurse,
                but her training was very narrow and confined to a particular
                area — that task had not been part of that training.
                Obviously, there is a problem.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In September 2000, the Department
                commissioned an additional 300 student nurse training places for
                the following three years. That was commendable, but we will
                need many more nurses. A few years ago there were seven nurse
                training schools in Northern Ireland which operated not just in
                the Royal Victoria Hospital but in other hospitals, including
                Belfast City Hospital and the Mater Hospital. Most of these
                schools have been done away with. Sometimes I long for the
                return of matron, who looked after the whole hospital.
                Complaints are made today about dirt and dust in hospitals. But
                I am straying from the substance of the motion, so I will return
                to main issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The universities have developed two
                return-to-nursing courses with the aim of encouraging former
                nurses, who left the profession to rear their families, back to
                nursing. The Department is to launch a major initiative to
                co-ordinate workforce planning and development across the
                various disciplines.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Each nurse possesses particular skills. For
                example, a nurse caring for the elderly requires skills that are
                vastly different from those needed by a nurse in an intensive
                care unit or a cardiac surgery unit. They are all specialists in
                their fields. Elderly patients must be cared for in the most
                appropriate environment. Following, for example, an acute chest
                infection or a stroke, many elderly people need a stage of
                recovery away from the frantic pace of an acute hospital ward.
                They need a system of care tailored to their needs. As a result,
                skilled nurses and other skilled staff are needed to look after
                them. The elderly require a mix of services, ranging from
                short-stay or long-stay rehabilitation to respite care.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is also the question of orthopaedic
                nurses. Some months ago, a group of orthopaedic surgeons spoke
                to the Health Committee following the death of a patient who had
                been transferred from Craigavon Area Hospital to the Royal
                Victoria Hospital. The orthopaedic surgeons said that although
                there was a shortage of orthopaedic surgeons and operating
                theatre space, the greatest problem was a shortage of
                appropriately trained nurses, a problem in almost every
                department in the Health Service.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I referred to cardiac surgery when talking
                about the case of the American nurse. However, the nurses who
                work in that department are highly specialised. Mr Coulter
                recently proposed a motion on community nursing. That type of
                nursing is a skill in itself, and there is a messy shortage of
                staff there. We had a major debate on community nursing, so I
                will not repeat the points that I made then.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is also a massive shortage of skilled
                doctors. Mr John Kelly spoke about Khalid Khan. I was directly
                involved in that matter, and, on the matter of skilled jobs, his
                case is relevant.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Khalid Khan resigned from the post of
                locum heading the burns unit in the Royal. He headed the burns
                unit yet was only an locum, and he had been a locum for about
                two years. He applied for a job in England and was about to go
                there. It was not he who went to the media to get something
                done. It was the people in Omagh who suffered from the terrible
                ravages of the bomb there. Donna Marie McGullion and her father
                Malachy Keyes led the campaign and involved politicians. My
                colleague Joe Byrne took a lead in that, and Oliver Gibson was
                very supportive as well.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Political pressure was applied. The people
                concerned came to Stormont and met some of us. They also met the
                Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety.
                Discussions were held with the Royal Victoria Hospital, with the
                deputy chief executive, Dr Ian Carson, and eventually with Dr
                Khan himself. The job was not only re-advertised, but the job
                description was rewritten. Dr Khan told me that his job had been
                to deal with the huge waiting list for treatment for burns and
                scalds. There is no way in which one man could do that, and Mr
                Khan has a wife and two children. An appointment is being made
                to a complementary post, but that was achieved by political
                pressure.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr J Kelly:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was not making a criticism of Dr Khan. My
                point was that we should not be dependent on one person to fill
                such a sensitive post. There really ought to be a number of
                people there. We cannot have a situation in which anaesthetists
                and heart surgeons can hold the rest of the Health Service to
                ransom. That is the fault of the training regime and the lack of
                skills rather than of an individual.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Hendron:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I totally accept what Mr Kelly has said. I
                was not being critical of that point at all. Without political
                pressure, Dr Khan would still be there, trying in a lonely way
                to give support to the people of Omagh and treat the ravages of
                the bomb. That skills shortage also affected women with breast
                cancer who needed breast reconstruction. They too looked to
                Khalid Khan for help and were here at Stormont as well.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I just want to make one point about job
                skills in cardiac surgery. People are being sent to Britain and
                elsewhere for by-pass surgery, and I appreciate that there is a
                review of that. I also appreciate that the Minister of Higher
                and Further Education is not responsible at all for these
                matters. I want to put one question to him on that, however. It
                was well known for some months beforehand that a brilliant
                cardiac surgeon, Mr&nbsp;Hugh&nbsp;O’Kane, was retiring, yet a
                review of cardiac surgery was being set up. As everybody knew
                that he was retiring long before, why was his job not advertised
                well in advance?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a big shortage in primary care and
                of general practitioners. However, as there is a paper on
                primary care in the pipeline, I will not go into that now. I
                have already made reference to the orthopaedic nurses, and there
                is of course a shortage of orthopaedic surgeons. Apparently some
                years ago one orthopaedic surgeon did the lot — every joint,
                bone, et cetera. Nowadays, however, it is argued that if you are
                an expert on the knee joint, for example, you are not an expert
                on the ankle joint.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I move on to occupational therapists — the
                young ladies who do a fantastic job across the North of Ireland.
                There is a massive shortage there as well, though there has been
                a slight increase in numbers in the last two years.
                Nevertheless, there is something very wrong when a woman or man
                of 75 or 80 years of age has to wait a year for somebody to make
                an assessment when maybe all that is needed is an extra banister
                on the stairs. I do not want to belittle occupational
                therapists, but there is something wrong with the system.
                However, that issue is being examined.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has been a wide-ranging review of
                pathology, and some medical laboratory scientific officers have
                been at Stormont in the past 12&nbsp;months — young men and
                women who are highly qualified. Some Members, including myself,
                were recently invited to the Royal Victoria Hospital, where we
                met laboratory personnel from haematology and pathology. These
                people have honours degrees and tremendous expertise, yet they
                are being paid peanuts. There is something very wrong there.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Health visitors have special skills, but
                there is also a massive shortage in this area. The same goes for
                midwives and social workers — if we were to go into the
                question of social workers and the shortage there, where would
                we finish?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My final point is in connection with human
                resources management. I have already stated that the Executive
                and the Assembly will have to look at the Department, the boards
                and the trusts. In making an assessment of skills shortages, the
                Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety
                currently receives a central download from the human resources
                management system each trust and board headquarters and agency
                of health and personal social services.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Hendron, I ask you to bring your remarks
                to a close.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Quarterly, the director of information
                systems extracts data from each site, which is then amalgamated
                and sent electronically to the Department. Although the human
                resources management system has been developed, there has been
                little or no guidance from the Department about standardisation
                of codes, so an accurate assessment of shortages cannot be made.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Danny&nbsp;O’Connor for moving the
                motion. I know that Members will give every support they can to
                the young men and women working in the Health Service.</p>

                We need to leave time for Mr&nbsp;O’Connor and the Minister to
                wind up, and I do not want to limit the debate. I ask Members to
                bear that in mind.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Morrice:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I understand the position, and I will be
                brief.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a terrible irony in the skills
                shortages here. It is a matter of concern that they extend to
                many different sectors. Many efforts over many years have gone
                into securing jobs and inward investment — bums on seats, if
                you like. However, that is of no value at all if young people
                and the unemployed do not have the skills to enable them to do
                those jobs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is commendable that we have managed to cut
                unemployment by half in 15&nbsp;years. When I started work in
                the BBC business unit in 1987, unemployment was running at about
                14% or 15%. Now it is down to 6%. That is excellent, but there
                is no doubt that there are skills shortages of considerable
                proportions, which can only get worse before they get better
                unless we move very fast. The reason we find ourselves in this
                situation is simple — a lack of strategic planning, a lack of
                vision. When we simply create jobs, the focus is on short-termism.
                Creating jobs is grand, but of little value if we do not have
                the skills to enable the posts to be filled.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I appreciate the point made by Mr&nbsp;Carrick
                about the need to create jobs that are relevant to the
                workforce, and a workforce that is relevant to the jobs. Such a
                correlation between labour supply and labour demand is important
                to our economic future.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am grateful to Members for raising the
                matter of education. That is hugely important — the 20% figure
                that we have been given of working adults who are unable to read
                the instructions on a medicine bottle is totally unacceptable
                and must be addressed. However, that is a responsibility of
                Departments other than the Department of Higher and Further
                Education, Training and Employment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Focusing now on the Health Service, we are
                aware of the publicity surrounding the recruitment of Filipino
                nurses. The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) is probably best
                placed to talk about a lack of skills. It said in its submission
                to the draft Programme for Government</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Despite 100 new training places for
                nurses created this year, and for the next three years, the RCN
                believes that this is still not sufficient to address the real
                and severe nurse shortages gripping the Northern Ireland Health
                Service.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It went on to say that 250 more training
                places for nurses need to be created each year to address those
                shortages, which the RCN said were caused by a reduction in such
                places throughout the 1990s.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to draw Members’ attention, and
                possibly that of Minister of Health, Social Services and Public
                Safety, to the fact that only 39 nurses — and Dr&nbsp;Hendron
                referred to this — completed the return to professional
                practice course last year. Is that because they received no
                remuneration, in spite of working around 100 hours per week?
                This is about the value we place on Health Service staff.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Attracting young women and, taking Mr O’Connor’s
                point, young men to the nursing profession is not just about
                training. It is about ensuring that we value, through pay and
                respect, the work they do. It is about giving nurses equity with
                other health professionals and, as the RCN rightly suggested,
                placing them at the core of improving the health of our people.
                It is important that that be the way forward.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Khalid Khan case, which I mentioned, as
                did Mr J Kelly and Dr Hendron, exposes the skills shortage, the
                unavailability of highly skilled people like Dr Khan and the
                lack of equipment. This also concerns the burns unit — I am
                sure we are all glad that Dr Khan was able to stay.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other professions have been mentioned —
                occupational therapists, medical laboratory staff, et cetera. I
                am disappointed that I have not heard of proper research in
                those areas. Dr Birnie mentioned the priority skills unit that
                is being set up. We welcome that important news, but it is vital
                that research begins soon so that we can know exactly what
                skills are missing to enable us to fill the gaps.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In conclusion, if we want to achieve
                greatness in the new Northern Ireland, we badly need to prove
                that we are worthy of it.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McFarland:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a danger of the motion’s falling
                between two stools. I have particular remarks to make about the
                NHS, and I hope that the Minister of Health, Social Services and
                Public Safety will hear them. There is clearly a shortage of
                staff in the NHS. Medical staff are leaving, and there are
                chronic shortages in some disciplines. That leads to overwork
                and disillusionment for those remaining, and so the cycle begins
                again. There is uncertainty about the future of primary care and
                acute hospitals — both these issues are currently the subjects
                of studies — which has led to a loss of confidence. We need to
                sort out the NHS now. The system needs to be reorganised and
                settled down.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a shortage of nurses. Some are
                leaving, but, perhaps more seriously, fewer are joining. I was
                speaking recently to a former very senior nurse. She is retired,
                but she visits schools. She recently visited a sixth form to
                talk about nursing. Out of that entire sixth form only two
                students were interested, and she believes that only one of the
                two will actually go on to nurse. That is worrying. There seems
                to be a culture in Northern Ireland that regards nursing as no
                longer an attractive profession. Perhaps that is not surprising
                given the view that nurses are not paid enough.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The recent short-term solutions have been to
                import nurses from Australia and the Philippines and to
                encourage nurses back into the profession. I recently met a lady
                who trained in the Royal Victoria Hospital but spent her entire
                nursing life in America. She returned here to retire but was
                persuaded back into nursing. She is having an absolute ball,
                back at the Royal, having completed her retraining course. That
                solution can only be short-term.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am concerned too that the Department may
                not know how many trained nurses there are here. Lots of ladies
                train but leave to have families. I wonder whether a record is
                kept of all trained nurses and doctors so that they can be
                contacted, given the shortage, to see if they are interested in
                returning.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am also worried that the Department may not
                have a proper human resources department with the necessary
                expertise. Some of the shortages may be attributed to slightly
                daft reasons. Dr Hendron touched on the subject of occupational
                therapists. That is an interesting area. Some elderly people, or
                those who live on their own or in Housing Executive property,
                need handles to help them get up in the toilet or bathroom or
                move outside, and the only people qualified to decide where
                these handles should go are occupational therapists. The skilled
                tradesmen who fit these handles and rails — presumably they do
                such jobs and know where to put them — are not allowed to do
                this work for health and safety reasons. If someone fell, the
                tradesmen would end up in court. That is daft. Hundreds of
                people need such measures fitted, but there are insufficient
                occupational therapists to make the necessary visits. That leads
                to the perception of a chronic shortage of occupational
                therapists.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If someone were to come up with a design
                based, for example, on the height of the patient, that could
                determine the point above a bath at which a handle should be
                placed, thus enabling tradesmen to fit them, would there be this
                perception of an enormous shortage of occupational therapists?
                It seems crazy that no one can be bothered to find a solution to
                that. We prefer to disappoint and inconvenience hundreds of
                elderly people rather than try to find a practical solution to
                the problem. The Department needs a proper personnel branch to
                develop solutions for recruiting, training and retaining staff.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, I will move to the general skills
                shortage. Businessmen tell of the abilities of potential staff
                and their enormous skills shortage — some cannot add and
                others cannot write for toffee. Universities say that they have
                to run courses for their first year students — to retrain
                them. Shorts has set up a department to deal with that. Clearly
                there is a problem with providing these necessary skills.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I ask the Minister to get together with his
                Colleagues in the Departments of Education and Enterprise, Trade
                and Investment to produce a common training system or curriculum
                that will give employers staff with the right skills to the
                right standard. Until we do that, we will have a skills
                shortage.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs I Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion speaks of the skill shortage in
                the Health Service and calls on the Minister of Higher and
                Further Education, Training and Employment to take steps to
                address the problem. However, the skill shortage is due to other
                factors in the Health Service. I agree with Dr Birnie that the
                motion could have been broadened to include action that the
                Minister of Health needs to take urgently.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, there is the contributing factor of
                getting enrolled nurses to become registered nurses. There are
                over 400 enrolled nurses here. If the majority were to become
                registered, it would make a big impact on the skills shortage.
                We need to find out why they do not want to do that and with
                what emoluments they can be encouraged. Is it the lack of
                reward, the undervaluing of the service or the cost of
                conversion courses? We must find out why we have so many
                enrolled nurses who remain so.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, there is another hidden factor —
                staff bullying by seniors. The money paid out to those who have
                taken claims against trusts is an indication of the number of
                skilled staff, including nurses, leaving the service. A recent
                meeting in Lisburn for staff being bullied in the Health Service
                attracted over 200 people. The situation is so bad that a
                support group has been set up. While we do not know the exact
                numbers that have left because of bullying, we will get a better
                indication when we know what money is being paid out— a factor
                that I am currently pursuing with the Minister of Health.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thirdly, some 1,500 staff took early
                retirement in the last three years. Technically, each year 500
                skilled staff take early retirement and are lost to the service.
                To cover for that loss and to make up the shortfall we would
                have to recruit twice that number. Failure to do so has worsened
                the situation. Perhaps the Health Service should operate the
                same policy as applies in education, where school governors only
                look at an application for early retirement if it will have no
                impact on the service given to pupils and if a suitable
                replacement can be found. Can this not be done in the Health
                Service?</p>

                that more than 8,000 staff are on long-term sick leave. How many
                of these account for the skills shortage? I doubt if anyone
                knows. However, if that matter were tackled, it would reduce the
                numbers of skilled staff needed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, there is the bad decision making
                that demoralises staff, causing them to leave and go elsewhere.

                Is the closing of the Jubilee and the transfer to the Royal

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With the greatest of respect, it is. To date,
                some 40 staff have quit, which is very relevant, and time after
                time, services have had to close. Senior staff have even gone to
                other countries, taking a pay cut at the same time, because they
                have been so demoralised by the bad decisions continually being
                made.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That serious issue must be addressed if we
                are to retain the skilled staff that are so essential. It is
                evident to all that there are a number of problems in the Health
                Service, which, if tackled, would reduce the skill shortage and,
                thereby, the need for overseas recruitment.</p>

                I support the motion. It would be remiss of me not to say that
                it is unfortunate that the debate should be used to attack the
                Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety. That is
                what seems to be happening. Constant negative reporting, fuelled
                by many in the House, does not help to make the Health Service
                attractive to work in, yet it only functions because of the
                staff’s hard-working commitment. The truth is that chronic
                under-funding, a lack of planning and successive British
                absentee Ministers have had a detrimental effect on it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to broaden the debate and concentrate
                on employment and skilled workers generally. I would like the
                Minister to ensure that business competition is not hobbled by a
                lack of people with the right skills. We have to reach out to
                the disaffected and socially disadvantaged and persuade them
                that learning is not a burden, and they must have the means to
                learn. We must build on what has succeeded in post-16 education
                and training and create a scheme that is even better. We must
                set up a learning and skills council as a non- departmental
                public body that will work with employers of all sizes to assess
                their current and future skills needs and fund effective
                training that is open to as many as possible. Small businesses
                especially need help with training. Many firms require a skilled
                workforce to enable them to move into new product areas and
                provide new opportunities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The learning and skills council should seek
                to break down the barriers that have stopped people undertaking
                training that would put them on the right path to a job.
                Barriers exist for all kinds of reasons, including religious
                discrimination, age, disability and gender. The learning and
                skills council must ensure that it funds training to suit people’s
                needs. Colleges and training providers should find innovative
                ways of getting training to those who want it. Making a decision
                to update skills or change career should not mean that people
                have to disrupt the rest of their lives to get the right
                training.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The learning and skills council should take
                over from the training and enterprise councils and organise
                training locally. Council members should be drawn from local
                areas, and a percentage should be employers who are best placed
                to know what skills are and will be needed locally.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Councils should have about £100 million to
                spend on training, much of which would lead to qualifications,
                though some would not. Some training might help people keep up
                to date with changes in technology, while other training might
                assist those who missed out on formal education earlier in life
                and improve their chances in the job market. Other training
                would help people to make more of themselves and realise their
                potential as individuals.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The aim of the council should be to bring
                thousands of people back to learning. It should work over a
                large area by identifying colleges or training providers and
                encouraging them to work together instead of competing. That
                would make the most of public money and ensure that no effort
                was wasted.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Planning co-ordination should reduce the
                limited training provision caused by rapid technological change.
                It is unrealistic to continue investing in specialist equipment,
                such as printing, when an employer’s premises could be used as
                a centre of excellence to train trainers in the latest
                technologies. Councils can recognise local needs and provide
                specialist courses through in-house training.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The point of the learning and skills council
                is to bring more people into learning for longer and to raise
                standards. It would bring a new and sharper focus to the way
                training is funded, help build strong businesses and communities
                and assist individuals to play an active part in securing
                economic success.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Beggs:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am pleased that Mr O’Connor has raised
                this important matter. I wish to concentrate on the shortages in
                the health and social services sector as they relate to
                experiences in my constituency.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, there have been unduly long waiting
                lists for occupational therapy services. Assessments for some of
                my constituents have taken 12 to 18 months. I acknowledge that
                there has been some additional investment in occupational
                therapy, but there has also been additional responsibility —
                for example, for wheelchair assessment and allocation — which
                is absorbing some of that investment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Occupational therapy assessment can affect
                the quality of life of the infirm, elderly and disabled. Many
                home improvements await assessments — whether it be for
                handrails, showers or heating upgrades. Those adaptations enable
                constituents to live longer in their homes and, thus, reduce the
                cost to the community care budget that would be incurred if they
                were to go into residential care.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My constituents have also made me aware of
                the pressures on specialist speech and language therapy in
                schools and the patchy provision of speech therapy for those
                seeking treatment. One constituent had his speech therapy
                interrupted for eight months because his therapist was ill and
                there was difficulty with recruiting a replacement. I quote from
                a letter that I received from a health trust:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Our experience over the past year is
                that we have had to advertise posts a number of times before
                filling them and that the number of applicants applying for
                posts is very small. In some instances there are no applicants
                for posts.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have raised that with the Minister
                responsible and understand that a review group was to report at
                the end of last year. I do not know whether the Professions
                Allied to Medicine (PAMs) group has yet met.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, I turn to the shortages in the
                nursing profession — a number of Members have mentioned this
                — which are limiting the quality of health care that can be
                provided. In the early 1990s, we exported nurses. We trained
                many able students; we did not have sufficient vacancies; and
                nurses were forced to leave.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nursing training was reduced from over 800 to
                about 400 — a huge drop. It was crazy to reduce the training
                so dramatically, and now we have shortages. During that period
                there have been technological changes that require more
                intensive nursing. Also, demographic changes have resulted in a
                more elderly population that requires additional community care
                services.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There seems to be a variety of estimates of
                the current number of nursing vacancies. In answer to a question
                that I asked last year, the Minister estimated 141 vacancies.
                The Assembly’s research department estimates that the trusts
                and boards have some 300 to 400 vacancies. In the independent
                sector there are a further 300 to 400 vacancies. There is a big
                question mark about the quality of information in the
                Department. I welcome the fact that 100 additional nurses are
                now to be trained each year, but there is considerable doubt
                about whether that will be enough.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have one constituent who sought from an
                early age to become a nurse. Her qualifications would meet the
                requirements of the nursing boards in Scotland, but she was not
                successful in Northern Ireland. Higher qualifications are
                required here. We are now exporting students for training in
                other parts of the United Kingdom, when the demand is here.
                There is mismanagement in the Department.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.00</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition, in answer to a question the
                Minister said that 107 work permits have been issued here for
                nurses from outside the European Union. That mismanagement is a
                result of the existing structure. There is a central Department,
                but I do not know what it does. It does not deliver services. We
                need one authority to be responsible for training nurses with
                flexibility in its budget to enable it to deliver what is
                needed. Linking the delivery of services to a central health
                authority is part of the solution.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Byrne:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I congratulate Mr O’Connor on tabling the
                motion. As the Chairperson of the Higher and Further Education,
                Training and Employment Committee said, an inquiry into skills
                training and needs in the public and private sector industries
                is ongoing. Ninety organisations have indicated that they want
                to make submissions. Sadly, however, only one private sector
                employer has agreed to submit material to the inquiry. The
                remainder are in the public sector. That is an indication of our
                enterprise deficit. However, the Committee is trying to get more
                private sector employers to give it their opinions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion refers to the skills shortages in
                Northern Ireland in general and in the Health Service in
                particular. It is a result of the mismatch between supply and
                demand in the labour market, and that is a challenge for us
                all.There is a particular challenge with the long-term
                unemployed, central to whom are the 20% of people who lack basic
                numeracy and literacy skills. That must be tackled, and I hope
                that the Minister will be able to do something about it over the
                next two to three years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People who live in large urban housing
                estates and have endured long-term unemployment do not have any
                hope. We must give them hope with skills training that will
                enable them to compete.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is also the shortage of skilled
                personnel in the Health Service. I agree with Dr Hendron that,
                in the past, seven hospitals provided nursing training. I am not
                sure about the merits of centralising all such training in
                universities. I lectured in further education and saw many
                aspiring nurses do a pre-nursing course before their hospital
                training. University training may be desirable, though, for
                higher skills.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McFarland said that a survey of sixth
                formers at a secondary school showed that only two people were
                interested in nursing. I agree. It is no longer the attractive
                option it once was, and it is more difficult to get into.
                Nowadays, one has to be a high-flying academic to get into
                nursing. However, nursing is mainly about caring. Very often
                people who study nursing do not need such high-level academic
                entry qualifications. Many students go on to do the Advanced
                GVNQ in health and social care, which is not the proper route
                for people who want to be nurses.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am sure the Member is not suggesting that
                nurses have lower academic qualifications than other
                professionals. Nursing is a critical area that touches on life
                or death.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">May I remind Mr Byrne that if he gives way
                his time will be limited.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Byrne:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yes, but I was being sensitive to the Member’s
                interests. I do not think that my comments indicate that I am in
                favour of lesser qualifications for nurses. In the past when
                nurses were trained in hospitals more people wanted to enter the
                profession. Fewer people are now entering it, and there is a
                shortage of 800&nbsp;nurses here. As Mr Beggs said, we are
                importing trained nurses, while in the past we exported them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Also, when we had matrons, there was a
                leadership role for nurses. Nurses feel demoralised. Ward
                managers are largely in charge of their responsibilities, and
                many of them find that difficult to cope with. That can be
                tackled if there is co-ordination between the Department of
                Health and the Department of Higher and Further Education,
                Training and Employment, and I hope that that will happen.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Lastly, when the Committee concludes its
                inquiry we will have a clearer picture of the skills gap in
                general and, I hope, in the Health Service in particular.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr R Hutchinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion, but it is rather
                unfortunate that its wording seems to point the finger at the
                Minister of Higher and Further Education, Training and
                Employment. I am sure that was not intentional. Lest Dr&nbsp;Farren
                think I have made a new year resolution to give him an easy
                ride, he need not panic. He will not get an easy ride. Both
                Dr&nbsp;Farren and the Committee have taken this seriously and
                are doing an excellent job trying to rectify the imbalances in
                this area.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In spite of the disturbing fact that little
                research evidence supports the apparent shortage of staff and
                expertise in some hospital trusts, significant recent examples
                confirm that the standard of service being offered by the trusts
                is considerably burdened. We read horrific stories in
                newspapers, and constituents tell us about the difficulties that
                they encounter. It appears that meeting current needs from the
                indigenous market is no longer an option. Instead of recruiting
                from inside Northern Ireland, which has an unacceptable level of
                unemployment — trusts, as Dr Hendron said, have had to travel.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I felt as if I was back in church on Sunday
                morning, because every time my clergyman says &quot;And
                finally,&quot; I know that he will go on for another
                45&nbsp;minutes. Dr&nbsp;Hendron said that a few times this
                morning, and I was panicking lest none of us would get a chance
                to speak.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, I agree with what he said about
                bringing nurses from the Philippines and Australia to remedy our
                shortages. Although there is no research to prove it, evidence
                suggests that there are not even enough agency nurses. Can the
                Minister of Health explain why research into skills shortages
                here is so inadequate? Establishing the extent of her Department’s
                need would be a useful first step towards dealing with the dire
                situation. How does she intend to address the surprising lack of
                research?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The problem is not restricted to nursing.
                Leading practitioners and medical laboratory staff are also in
                the spotlight over their frustration with a system that has
                consistently underfunded acute medical needs. Members will
                recall our debate a few months ago on laboratory technicians.
                They feel under pressure, and their needs are not being
                adequately met. Indeed, the difficulty is less the
                responsibility of Dr Farren than of the Minister of Health,
                Social Services and Public Safety, who seems to be less than
                eager to put it right. There is a logjam, and the Health
                Minister needs to acknowledge her responsibility to sort the
                situation out. Can she assure the House that she has done more
                than simply adopt the policies of her predecessors? What
                significant steps has she taken to answer the complaints of
                patients, practitioners and nursing and technical medical staff
                about the chronic underfunding?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am delighted to have stirred up such

                patients be in a Health Service that is struggling to meet its
                needs, particularly its staffing needs? One is often left
                feeling that Minister de Brún’s Health Service is in urgent
                need of a radical cure.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Higher and Further Education,
                Training and Employment (Dr Farren):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the debate, and I have listened to
                all the contributions with considerable interest. It is
                important that Members reflect concern about matters such as the
                skills needs of our economy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most Members who dealt with the part of the
                motion that refers to the Health Service accept that those
                matters do not lie within my sphere of responsibility. I am sure
                that my Colleague the Minister of Health, Social Services and
                Public Safety will take note of the comments made in respect of
                her responsibilities and respond to Members accordingly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is, of course, a degree of overlap on a
                small number of Health Service related issues. In our
                universities and, to some extent, in our colleges of further and
                higher education provision is made for the professional needs of
                the Health Service. Members need to appreciate that the
                provision of places on such courses is, by and large, a matter
                for negotiation between the institutions concerned, the
                Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, the
                trusts and the health boards.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Therefore it is only in a limited way that I
                have even indirect responsibility. It is up to the universities
                and the colleges, in the context of those negotiations, to
                determine the level of provision that is made for places on
                their degree and other courses. I respond to the debate from the
                more general perspective that is suggested in the opening part
                of the motion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was particularly pleased to note the
                comments of the Chairperson of the Committee who reminded
                Members that the Committee is now engaged in an extensive study
                of the skills needs of our economy. Obviously, from the range of
                responses received and from some of the submissions already
                made, there is great interest in the Committee’s work. I look
                forward to its report.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to make some general points which are
                pertinent to addressing the skills needs of our economy. My
                first point, to which some Members have referred, is that we are
                operating in a labour market that is much more positive and
                challenging than it was a decade ago, or perhaps even five years
                ago. With unemployment at the low level of approximately 6%, and
                employment at a record high, we have a tighter labour market.
                Certain skills are in high demand, and pressures, of a kind not
                previously experienced, are being felt across a number of
                sectors.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members will appreciate — and this has also
                been referred to — that people who were trained here in
                various occupations have left Northern Ireland. That has had
                consequences for the Health Service, and we are attempting to
                attract specialists from overseas, from very distant lands, to
                make up the deficits.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our labour market is not isolated, and our
                situation is very open. There is considerable mobility in the
                Health Service and the construction industry, with whose
                representatives I have been in regular contact over recent
                months. They point to the highly attractive rates of
                remuneration and job opportunities available south of the
                border, factors that are drawing many away who have skills that
                are needed by the construction industry. We are working hard to
                make up the deficits thereby created.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We also see these problems in the information
                and communications technology area and others. These pressures
                are not simply a result of our economic successes in recent
                years. Pressures are also from without — whether south of the
                border, across the Irish Sea, or globally. Members will
                appreciate that the information and communications technology
                sector is operating in a labour market which, globally, is
                experiencing considerable skills shortages. We therefore need to
                undertake more detailed planning to enable us meet the skills
                needs of our economy and ensure that all its sectors are
                provided with sufficient workers with the highest possible level
                of technical and professional skills.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some Members suggested that there is an
                absence of strategic planning. That is far from the truth. A
                considerable degree of strategic planning is constantly under
                way in my Department, and that is reflected in the Programme for
                Government, as those who have read and studied it know.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have a well-endowed education and training
                infrastructure to meet the challenges, which many Members
                frequently acknowledge. A report published last month by the
                Northern Ireland Economic Council, written by Prof Michael Best,
                a world-renowned researcher and commentator on economic planning
                from the University of Massachusetts, states</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Northern Ireland’s educational system
                offers a basis for competitive advantage with considerable
                potential. Few regions in the world of the size of Northern
                Ireland have the range of university level disciplines in
                engineering and science-related areas, particularly in
                information technology.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Elsewhere in his report, Prof Best refers to
                the size of the information technology programmes at the
                University of Ulster and Queen’s University as being
                &quot;particularly impressive&quot;. He describes them as</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;a magnet for information technology
                companies given the global shortage of skills in this area. The
                opportunities for industrial policy are considerable.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Later in his report, Prof Best points to the
                considerable potential of our further education colleges to help
                to meet the skills needs of our economy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members will appreciate that the professor’s
                report is not simply a list of compliments. He makes criticisms
                but also recommends plans to meet our skills needs. I agree with
                some of his criticisms, some of which have been voiced here this
                morning. However, action is being taken in response to almost
                all of the points, and I remind Members of some of the
                initiatives that are underway.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are not yet achieving 100% success, but
                any objective assessment would conclude that we are making
                considerable headway in the drive to meet our skill needs. The
                major focus of my Department, since its establishment, has been
                on avoiding skills shortages. I have taken steps to ensure that
                the vocational education and training system is focussed on and
                addresses industry’s needs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These measures include placing greater
                emphasis on researching the labour market. One Member said that
                there is no evidence of any such research, but a considerable
                amount has been completed, and reported on, in recent years. I
                invite Members who may not be familiar with my Department’s
                annual bulletin to examine its wide- ranging set of research
                reports on many aspects of our labour market. That negatives any
                suggestion that there is an absence of detailed research into
                the labour market here.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have increased the number of places in
                higher and further education, particularly in vocational areas
                of employment growth. The number of modern apprenticeships, for
                example, now stands at more than 3,000, and it is increasing.
                Many of these include apprenticeships for the construction
                industry. The areas in the higher and further education sectors,
                such as information and communications technologies, electronic
                and software engineering, manufacturing engineering, tourism and
                catering are all receiving particular attention to the extent
                that the number of places available to students has increased
                significantly. In my recent proposals for new forms of financial
                support for students, I have identified key areas requiring
                special attention. My objective is to give those from low income
                and disadvantaged backgrounds access to further and higher
                education.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Increasing access to education and training
                for all through New Deal programmes, the bridge-to- employment
                initiatives, the promotion of individual learning accounts and
                the opening of a considerable number of &quot;learndirect&quot;
                centres across Northern Ireland is further evidence that the
                strategy to meet skills needs is being implemented. Indeed, most
                Members are now familiar with the phrase &quot;life-long
                learning&quot;, which encapsulates many of those initiatives.
                Only yesterday, I attended an event organised by the Educational
                Guidance Service for Adults to publicise adult learners’ week,
                which, although not its only initiative, will devote particular
                attention to the basic skills needs of many adults.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I sympathise with the remarks made about that
                problem by many Members. It causes me a great deal of concern.
                The programme will receive all the resources that we can make
                available. The Chairperson of the Higher and Further Education,
                Training and Employment Committee and other Members reflected a
                degree of concern over the budgetary allocations required to
                deal with that. I am working hard to ensure that additional
                allocations will be made available from the Executive programme
                funds.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The strategic report detailing how we should
                address the need for basic skills, literacy and numeracy was
                published shortly before Christmas by the basic skills unit. It
                is a detailed report, and I trust that the resources needed to
                implement its recommendations will be made available. Members
                may recall that the &quot;Back to Your Future&quot; campaign was
                launched recently in conjunction with the Minister of
                Enterprise, Trade and Investment to attract highly skilled and
                experienced people back to Northern Ireland. Companies have been
                pleased with the numbers who have logged on to the web site.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.30 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members might be interested to know that
                there have been over 2,000 hits on the web site. Sixteen
                companies advertised job vacancies, and in a short time 150
                applications were attracted. A considerable degree of
                satisfaction is being expressed. It is a small initiative,
                designed to attract people from Northern Ireland currently
                working abroad to return and make their future here.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other initiatives either directly or
                indirectly involving my Department address skills needs. One of
                those is the interdepartmental working group on employability. A
                Member referred to the needs of those who leave school with
                minimal qualifications, who are at the margins, as it were, of
                society and at risk from whatever appeal there is in crime,
                drugs and so on. Reports on their condition and circumstances
                are among the reasons for that committee’s establishment. In
                that context, we will address the barriers experienced to
                becoming employed and engaging in training programmes. We hope,
                as a result, to be much more effective in directing our training
                resources.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to draw Members’ attention to
                another initiative that is more directly the responsibility of
                the Minister of Education, though my Department is represented.
                A committee, chaired by Prof Sean Fulton, has been set up to
                look at careers guidance. Mr O’Connor and others referred to
                the urgent need for effective careers information and guidance
                in schools and further education establishments to give young
                people the best possible information, guidance and direction on
                the opportunities available.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Specific points were raised that I want to
                address. Reference was made to the report from the Federation of
                Small Businesses, which has just come to my desk. That
                identified a number of skills needs and deficits. The small
                business sector is probably under a lot of pressure as a result
                of expansion in some of our major enterprises, and its needs
                should be addressed in particular. I draw Members’ attention
                to the fact that, with the University for Industry’s support
                for adult training, small business and its training needs are
                receiving help from the courses being set up by the learn direct
                centres across Northern Ireland. Members can play an important
                role by encouraging more adults to take out individual learning
                accounts, which will enable them to avail of the training and
                education opportunities.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Minister, I remind you of the time

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am about to draw my remarks to a close.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I could refer to other initiatives, but those
                that I have mentioned should show Members that there is a
                multifaceted strategy because the issues to be addressed are
                wide-ranging and multifaceted. There is no single answer to the
                skills needs of our economy. A range of initiatives is being
                taken, many in a way that indicates the growing partnership
                between employers, trade unions and the training and educational
                institutions. We should pay tribute to all those involved in the
                Departments, the agencies and the institutions. We may not have
                got it all right, but we are clearly determined that we will get
                it right.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr O’Connor:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I accept that the wording of my motion means
                that it may fall between two stools. I had no intention of
                criticising Dr Farren or Ms de Brún. I merely wanted to open up
                debate on the subject as a result of needs identified by
                Mr&nbsp;R Hutchinson and Mr Beggs, who have received the same
                types of complaint as I have about one-year-long waiting lists
                for occupational therapy and children waiting 18&nbsp;months for
                treatment for dyspraxia, which is not considered a priority. We
                talk about adult learning, but we cannot address the basic
                learning needs of young people because of the lack of
                facilities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion might have been worded more
                clearly, but it was worded in response to constituency needs. I
                had spoken to various health trusts and was advised that while
                funds were available, trained people were not. I tabled the
                motion as a result of that information.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A much wider picture has emerged, however,
                given that various Members, starting with Dr&nbsp;Birnie, have
                referred to adult education. Mr Carrick elaborated on the point,
                stating that 20% of people starting on Jobskills, about 1,800
                people, lack basic numeracy and literacy skills. We must address
                that. We have a multifaceted approach, strategic thinking and
                planning, but we still have unemployed people. We are bringing
                in people to do jobs that unemployed people here have not been
                trained to do. That may be an oversimplification of the problem
                because we do accept movement in the labour market. As Dr
                Hendron said, nurses come here from the Philippines while, as
                Mr&nbsp;Beggs said, people leave our shores to go to Scotland to
                nurse.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A hard core of unemployed people must be
                affected by our actions if we are to target social need. As the
                Minister acknowledged, young people are those most likely to be
                influenced by crime or drugs, and I am glad that he is aware of
                that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Carrick also touched on the export of
                skills. We do not want to create a brain drain; we want people
                to stay and help us become more prosperous. We do not want our
                best people to go somewhere else. That is why it is important to
                focus on training for the jobs that are here and need to be
                safeguarded. In an ideal world, everybody would like everyone to
                be working and earning £1,000 a week, but then we would have to
                bring in people from other countries to do some of the more
                labour-intensive tasks.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Morrice mentioned a lack of vision, saying
                that in the past there was job creation without thought of
                sustainability. There were quick fixes by previous Ministers who
                threw a few jobs at a sector, thinking that if it were to
                collapse in a couple of years, no real harm would be done
                because a new Government would be in place and it would be
                somebody else’s problem. We want to create a sustainable
                economy here that can develop and make people much more
                prosperous.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr John Kelly said that 55% of small
                businesses are unhappy with the availability of skilled labour,
                such as bricklayers, joiners, carpenters, plumbers and so on.
                These people are important. If we are going to have a factory
                that employs 200 people in the IT industry, we need people to
                build the factory in the first place. People seem to be obsessed
                with IT, thinking that everything is going to be about
                computers, but factories and houses will always have to be
                built.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People can earn big money by going to Dublin
                or elsewhere, so we have to ensure that we create the type of
                economy in which they can earn that sort of money here.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McFarland mentioned alternative solutions.
                He suggested that time could be managed better by the simple
                implementation of certain aides-mémoires to people carrying out
                occupational therapy work. The purpose of the debate was to try
                to throw out a lot of new ideas and to ensure that people could
                listen to what others were saying and get some degree of focus
                on what is needed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Robinson spoke about staff bullying. It
                is horrific that so many people attended a meeting on that. I
                have heard of people being bullied at work, but I did not
                realise that it was happening on such a horrendous scale. If we
                have 500 early retirements in addition to normal age retirements
                each year, there is clearly a great need to recruit, not just to
                tread water but to remedy the deficits that Mr J Kelly and Mr M
                Murphy mentioned and which we saw so much of in the past.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Murphy also made an important point about
                identifying and targeting local training needs. The training for
                people in Fermanagh might be geared towards hospitality, whereas
                in east or north Antrim it might be geared towards hospitality
                and tourism, and in other areas to construction or IT.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">12.45 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is an important point. We want to
                achieve local input, and local democracy is supposed to do that,
                yet Mr Beggs highlighted the 107 work permits that were granted
                to nurses from countries outside the EU, including the
                Philippines.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">According to weekend television reports,
                hospital trusts in the United Kingdom have been bringing in
                nurses from Africa who carry the HIV virus. There are potential
                dangers in bringing in staff from Third-World countries. I do
                not wish to appear xenophobic, but we need to examine how our
                staff are trained.</p>

                Dr Khan, whose case has been well rehearsed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Byrne touched on one of the most relevant
                issues, which is the need to give hope to those who do not seem
                to have any optimism and who lack basic literacy and numeracy
                skills. He also mentioned training schools for nurses, which, in
                the past, were part of hospitals rather than universities. In
                the past, there were state enrolled nurses (SEN) and state
                registered nurses (SRN) — this seemed to work well. But now we
                have a shortage of nurses. There is no reason for SRNs not going
                to university or for SENs not taking part in nurse training
                programmes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister’s announcement of

                not have the decency to be here to move it when he should have

                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, Mr Deputy Speaker, I apologise to you
                and to the House for not being present at the appointed time to
                move the motion. I accept that it was my responsibility to be
                here then. Unfortunately, because of engagements in another
                capacity and traffic delays, which I had not anticipated, I
                arrived here three or four minutes late. I do not blame any
                particular Minister for that. I did not come by public
                transport. Nevertheless, the state of the roads and the traffic
                congestion in Belfast are such that the House needs to address
                the problem, and I hope that it will do so.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I can understand why Sinn Féin, one of whose
                Ministers had the misfortune of not turning up here on time for
                a debate, would wish to have the issue pushed aside. The reason
                I asked for —</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion has been called. You are the
                proposer, and you have not yet referred to it. Will you kindly
                get on with the debate.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr S Wilson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Had I not apologised I would have been
                accused of treating the House with contempt. I wanted to spend a
                moment or two doing that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion is timely because the Minister of
                Education will, in the next three or four weeks, be making an
                announcement on capital spending for schools. It will be his
                second opportunity to allocate substantial sums of money —
                £72 million last year and £93 million in this year’s budget
                for capital spending. In certain parties of the Assembly, and
                outside among the general public, there was great disquiet last
                year when the schools capital programme was announced. Comments
                were made in the House. The Minister had been informed by
                members of the Education Committee that they expected fairness,
                and after the announcement, and especially in the sector of the
                school system that caters for the Protestant section of the
                population, there was great anger at the blatant and raw
                sectarian way in which the Minister had allocated his spending.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of course, it was presented with all the spin
                that one expects in modern politics. The Minister talked about
                the great boost from the largest ever amount of money for the
                capital building programme, across all sectors, primary,
                secondary, grammar, special, integrated, and to all the
                different education providers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Then one looked at the £72 million and at
                how it was to be allocated to the different sectors. Even at an
                initial glance, the figures gave cause for concern: £27·7
                million of the £72 million was for the controlled sector, the
                sector that caters mostly for the Protestant population. For the
                sector that caters mostly for the Roman Catholic population,
                there was £40·3 million— an imbalance of 55% to 38%.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That was bad enough. However, when one took
                away the Minister’s flannel and fancy accounting footwork,
                there was the startling picture of an imbalance of three to one
                against the sector that caters for the Protestant population:
                the Minister included in his announcement £6·7 million for
                Regent House Grammar School in Newtownards in spite of the fact
                that on 11 May 1998 the then Education Minister, Mr Worthington,
                had already announced that £6·7 million would be spent on
                Regent House. So, to pad the figures out, the Minister announced
                something again that had been said more than a year before.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If that was not enough, we then had the
                matter of Antrim Grammar School— oddly enough, this was the
                only such instance of this — where £7·7 million was to be
                spent. But one had to read the small print of the Minister’s
                statement to find that he never intended to spend that money.
                The project was to be started when money became available, and
                it was not anticipated that it would become available in the
                financial year for which the announcement was made, and, indeed,
                it did not. When that total of £14·4 million was deducted, the
                amount of money left for the education sector that caters for
                the Protestant population was only £13·3 million. The ratio
                was three to one.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.30 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of course, it could be argued — and this
                would have been a reasonable defence — that the spending was
                meant to reflect not the balance of pupils but the projects that
                had been suggested or the state of the schools in each sector.
                No one would have found that unfair. I do not care if money is
                spent on a school that caters mainly for Catholics or on one
                that caters mainly for Protestants if it can be justified by the
                fact that one sector is well provided for and the state of its
                school buildings is fine while pupils in the other sector are
                being taught in sub-standard conditions. No one would object to
                that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, when one looks at the figures upon
                which the Minister based his decision — the new starts which
                it was possible to announce — one sees no such imbalance. Over
                the six years for which I could obtain figures, the number of
                schools that required money spent on them, whether they catered
                mainly for Catholics or mainly for Protestants, was roughly
                even. There may have been a slight difference in favour of
                schools catering mainly for Catholics, but it was only one or
                two percentage points. Therefore it cannot be argued that this
                was based on the state of buildings in the various sectors.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will not dig up the Minister’s past
                record because time is short — which is partly my fault.
                However, we have a Minister who has been on record at least five
                times discussing the discrimination against Nationalists and
                Republicans which he believes occurred in the past. I believe
                that there is only one interpretation possible from the figures
                available on the one capital-spending decision that he has made.
                Whatever perceptions and grievances he and his party hold, he is
                abusing his position as Minister. He is taking money which
                should be allocated fairly and skewing it towards one side of
                the community, and no amount of fancy financial rope-trickery
                will hide that blatant imbalance.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the reasons for moving the motion
                before any decision is made is to enable me to use the Assembly
                to put down a marker for the Minister that this must not
                continue. With the Education Committee, Mr Kennedy and others, I
                have listened to pleas from schools in the maintained,
                controlled, voluntary, special and integrated sectors that
                people are being educated in poor conditions right across the
                board — no sector has a monopoly. The Minister must not be
                allowed to spend public money, allocated in good faith by the
                Assembly, in a way that is biased towards one sector. The facts
                are here, and no doubt the Minister will treat them in a
                cavalier manner, as he has in the past. Facts do not seem
                important to him, but the Assembly cannot ignore them, and it is
                important that the marker be set.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I could refer to individual schools, but I do
                not want to do so. The Education Committee has been careful not
                to lobby on behalf of individual schools, and we have told
                representatives, who have presented their cases to us, that we
                want to get a general picture of the state of school buildings.
                I am not lobbying on behalf of schools in my constituency —
                this is not a plea on their part. I am, however, saying that
                money should be allocated fairly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The budget for the Department of Education
                should not be used in a cavalier manner by a Minister with a
                narrow, political, sectarian agenda. The confines of the debate
                do not allow me to refer to other ways in which preference has
                been shown to those who fit into the Minister’s agenda. The
                figures speak for themselves. They are on public record and
                available in the Library and in Education Committee papers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is an important matter. We need more
                capital spending to improve the stock of schools, and many of us
                who have heard reports on and seen pictures of some of the
                buildings in which children are being educated have been
                appalled. Extensive capital spending on schools is needed, but
                it must be done in an equitable manner and not to redress
                imbalances that the Minister perceives to exist. He even
                believes his propaganda that only one section of the population
                suffers from disadvantage.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are aware of how unaccountable Ministers
                can be, taking decisions that are at odds with the Committees
                appointed to scrutinise them and at odds with the view of the
                majority of Members.The imbalance in capital spending this year
                may be exactly the same. Given his record, that is likely to be
                so. But let the Assembly say on that matter of concern that it
                expects the Minister to live up to his pledge to deal with these
                issues fairly. Many would disregard the word of the Minister
                because he has broken it on so many occasions, but we should at
                least hold him accountable.</p>

                on education. I will attempt to keep within the time
                constraints.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Education Committee is concerned about
                the condition of the school estate. The Committee has received
                from parents’ action groups, teachers, principals and student
                bodies numerous representations on the dreadful condition of
                many schools in the primary and non-primary sectors. The
                problems that we face concern outdated and inappropriate
                accommodation that does not meet modern educational needs and a
                lack of space. A large number of school buildings are crumbling.
                They have rotting window frames, inadequate fire exits and fire
                door protection and electrical faults. These are health and
                safety matters that illustrate the urgent need for a substantial
                increase in the funds for major capital projects.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A recent Department of Education general
                inspection report indicated that in one primary school
                deficiencies in school buildings are having a serious
                detrimental effect on children’s learning. Almost every Member
                will have seen the appalling conditions that exist. Such
                conditions are bound to have an effect on student and teacher
                morale and, therefore, a serious impact on education itself. The
                Education Committee finds the situation unacceptable and would
                like it to be addressed immediately.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Over the years, capital projects have been
                seriously neglected and underfunded, and urgent action needs to
                be taken. The Committee believes that investment in the capital
                building programme must be a high priority for the Executive and
                the Assembly. It would eliminate the major deficiencies and help
                to provide a modern and appropriate learning environment for
                children in the twenty-first century here.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Education Committee will be meeting the
                Minister and his officials next week to review the capital
                programme for the incoming year. Undoubtedly, a number of high
                priority cases will be competing for places and, with limited
                resources available, hard decisions will have to be made.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is imperative that equality and fairness
                be evident in the allocations that we make. To assist the
                process the Education Committee believes that the criteria used
                in making capital spending decisions should be widely known and
                understood and that they should be clear, open and transparent.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee received a range of views from
                education boards officials during its investigations. However,
                it is not totally clear on the method used for the final
                allocation of capital building money. A comprehensive and
                cohesive strategy is needed to address the appalling situation.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the Ulster Unionist spokesperson on
                education I want to express profound concern at the apparent
                imbalance in capital funding allocated to the controlled school
                sector in recent years. An analysis of the last five years
                highlights a marked disparity between the controlled and
                maintained sectors. That is totally unacceptable and must be
                addressed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the fact that the Minister is here
                today. His recent announcement on Strabane seems to pre-empt the
                review of the transfer procedure and the capital building
                programme. Apparently an announcement affecting education in
                Strabane has been made but has not yet been funded. When a
                Minister tells the people of Strabane, or anywhere else, that
                they are to get a new school that will involve capital
                expenditure, the money should be available for that. It seems
                improper for the Minister to have made that announcement short
                of consultation with the area boards and the Education
                Committee. I hope that he will address that when he speaks
                later.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is an urgent need for capital funding
                in all sectors. Consideration must be given in each to the
                allocation of funding on an equitable basis. Given the Minister’s
                political background, it is incumbent upon him to ensure that
                the controlled sector does not perceive itself to be undervalued
                or underfunded.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Lewsley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A number of issues to do with the allocation
                of capital funding need to be addressed, one of which is the
                categorising of schools that apply for capital funding. Schools
                are put into three categories, and those in category one receive
                priority. However, the majority of schools are in category two.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the criteria used by the Department
                when deciding which schools get capital funding concerns matters
                such as mobile classrooms. The Minister may give priority to
                schools whose classrooms have been destroyed or damaged by
                vandalism or whatever. As Sammy&nbsp;Wilson said, many of us can
                pick out schools in our constituencies that should get priority,
                but some schools were vandalised 25 years ago, and it has not
                been possible to use that accommodation since. Such schools have
                been housed in mobile classrooms for 25 years. Why were they not
                prioritised? Why did they have to wait until last year to get
                capital funding?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some children are being educated in schools
                that are over 130 years old. Are those schools not priority
                cases? We talk about best practice and value for money, but
                these cannot be achieved with heating or maintenance in a
                building that is over 130 years old.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need to ensure that social disadvantage is
                addressed and that targeting social need resources are directed
                towards schools most in need of capital. Unlike other Members, I
                regard it as well known that conditions in a large number of
                Catholic schools have been allowed to deteriorate dreadfully,
                with a high dependence on temporary mobile classrooms. Clearly,
                there needs to be equity in the system.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the interests of the equity that has been
                talked about today, we cannot just advocate a 50:50 split for
                funding. We need a proportionate allocation that reflects the
                state of schools, the health and safety of children and social
                disadvantage. We need an open and transparent system to assess
                educational needs and target genuine need. I ask the Minister if
                his Department has adequately assessed need and the schools
                estate. Does his Department have a benchmark for capital
                expenditure? How effective is the private finance initiative?
                Does it deliver what it is meant to and give value for money?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I have said often, there is not enough
                funding, particularly for children with special needs. With the
                development of the local management of schools, specialised
                posts have disappeared, and special needs are being dealt with
                in the classrooms. Funding is only available for statemented
                children.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How much reasonable adjustment has been made
                in the Budget to increase accessibility? If mobile classrooms
                are in use in a school, are they accessible to children with
                disabilities? I am not just talking about access through the
                front door of a school, but about access to all of a building
                and its facilities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a great need for strategic planning
                with all partners in education, because many of them are
                practitioners in the field. Who is better placed to give an
                opinion? There also needs to be an acceleration of the process
                of agreeing options, schedules of accommodation and economic
                appraisals.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, I mention the Government’s policy
                on rural proofing. I hope that the Minister can assure us that
                he will use that policy when he is making his final decisions.
                It is the responsibility of everyone in the Chamber to strive
                for an equitable education system that is accessible to every
                child.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McElduff:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Cuirim fáilte roimh an rún seo, agus de
                réir mo bharúla is ábhar fíorthábhach é ar fad. Ba mhaith
                liom rud amháin a chur san áireamh, agus is é an fhírinne
                nach raibh rudaí cothrom sa tsochaí ó thaobh cúrsaí
                oideachais de. Is é mo bharúil go dtosaíonn an turas chun na
                cothromaíochta sa lá inniu.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the motion. It helps the Assembly
                to concentrate on the important matter of the Education
                Department’s school building programme. Let us face it: many
                of our schools have serious accommodation problems. There is a
                great need across all sectors. No sector is excluded. A major
                commitment and investment are required to improve the overall
                condition of the schools by replacing sub-standard
                accommodation. It is needed where classrooms are undersized and
                overcrowded; where they are old and poorly maintained; where
                serious physical and structural deficiencies are posing health
                and safety risks; where inadequate physical education is
                provided; and where the very delivery of the school curriculum
                is inhibited, or narrowed, because children are not being taught
                in a safe, warm, dry and stimulating environment. If we are
                going to do a good job here, we should act in the interests of
                all our schoolchildren. That should concern us more than
                anything with respect to education.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On first reading the motion, one could be
                forgiven for believing that Mr Wilson has seen the light and is
                espousing the equality agenda, the removal of sectarian
                discrimination and the redressing of the historic funding
                imbalances and differentials that have disadvantaged particular
                education sectors. For example, the Catholic maintained sector,
                which was deemed to be underfunded by £200 million in 1983, did
                not receive 100% funding until 1993 — a mere eight years ago.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On first reading, I thought we were going to
                hear some enlightened commitment to the principles of equality
                from that most unusual of sources, Mr Sammy Wilson. However, it
                appears that my hopes were ill-founded. Mr Wilson evidently has
                different ideas. He has set out to take the debate out of
                context and wilfully ignore the experience of Catholics in
                education since partition and the inception of the six-county
                state. It happened in jobs and housing, and it happened in
                education as well.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our experience has been one of systematic
                structural discrimination, and there is much work to be done to
                create a level playing field, redress the balance and bring
                about equality for every citizen in the Six Counties and their
                children. Because I, with some foundation, doubted Mr Wilson’s
                intentions, I attempted to table an amendment before 9.30 am in
                the form of an addendum. It came as some surprise to me that the
                Business Committee, or the Speaker, disallowed my amendment,
                despite my meeting the clear deadline for tabling amendments of
                one hour before the start of business. It is a matter of some
                regret. My amendment would simply have added the following
                words:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;This should be based on educational
                need and taking account of the historical differential in
                capital funding between the maintained and controlled
                sectors.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important to get the historic
                perspective right to inform ourselves of the present and to
                acknowledge that there is an historical legacy. There is a much
                greater backlog in the Catholic maintained sector, which is
                playing catch-up, than in some other sectors. All of that was
                dealt with in the Standing Advisory Committee on Human Rights (SACHR)
                report compiled by Prof Tony Gallagher in the 1980s, which led
                to the journey to equality in that respect. Catholic
                parishioners were long forced to pay for their children’s
                educational facilities while other sectors enjoyed 100% funding
                all along. That is why many of our schools do not have the
                elaborate playing fields that other schools enjoy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The journey to equality does not begin today

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Things were not equal in the past, and that
                must be addressed. I support the calls for funding to be
                allocated on the basis of educational need, using a clear, open
                and transparent method and adhering absolutely to objective
                criteria. It is understandable that individual schools feel
                disappointed when they are not accepted on the programme. We
                also need to appreciate that various schemes are at various
                stages of design and planning. How many schemes are ready to go?
                That is a relevant question.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We can all quote figures. In the last five or
                six years Michael Ancram, I think, spent £23 million in one
                year on the school building programme. Three or four years later
                Mr McGuinness spent £72 million. It is reasonable to anticipate
                that the Minister will act in a fair manner with respect to
                this.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs E Bell:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion in principle. All
                Members should take upon themselves a personal duty to ensure a
                fair distribution of the capital spending budget between the
                various school systems. I support that. However, as other
                Members have said, there will always be concerns,
                disappointments and sometimes even relief when the annual
                announcement of the education capital building programme is
                made. It is right that we should monitor such announcements
                closely and watch where allocations are made.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We would all like to see local schools being
                given the necessary resources to improve or replace their
                buildings. In my constituency of North Down I have, with
                colleagues past and present, been engaged in a campaign that has
                lasted more than 20 years to have Glenlola Collegiate school
                estate improved. I was delighted and relieved when moneys were
                allocated to that last year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We also have in the area Clifton Special
                School, which originally opened its doors to 55 severely
                mentally and physically handicapped pupils. Now, more than 20
                years later, around 120 children are being educated in rooms and
                facilities that would be considered totally unacceptable in any
                other school, never mind in a school that is specifically for
                the severely handicapped. Pupils and staff put up with
                inconveniences daily, but still the school boasts a fine record.
                The Minister visited that school last October. He was shocked at
                what he saw, but he was also impressed by how well the staff and
                pupils cope. I would like that project, which, as I said, has
                been promised for many years, to have been part of last year’s
                programme. However, I am hopeful that it will be in the 2001
                programme.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As others have said, the procedures for
                inclusion in the capital building programme are long and
                complicated, but each sector and geographical area must be
                considered before final decisions are made. The timetable for
                all major capital schemes is protracted and will always involve
                consultation at various levels to ensure equity. Economic
                appraisals, development proposals and tender procedures all take
                time. Work by the Department on each project is intensive and
                has as its basic principle — and this is written in every
                board memorandum — that school needs must be met insofar as is
                possible.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I make these comments to show that it is
                possible to ensure at all stages that a fair capital spending
                programme can be drawn up by all involved. The allocation of new
                starts 2000-01 is as follows: maintained schools get 32·2% of
                the total, which is just over £23 million; voluntary schools
                27%, or £19·4 million; controlled schools — which Mr S
                Wilson is quite rightly worried about — 35%, or £25·3
                million; integrated schools 2%, or £1·4 million; and special
                schools 3·8%, or £2·8 million.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If we are talking about equity, we need to
                look carefully at integrated, special and Irish-medium schools.
                Integrated education, people will argue, is a small part of the
                education sector. I wonder why. If all education were
                integrated, we would not be worrying today about sectarian
                headcounts.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Last year’s allocation was the largest we
                have had, and I hope tthat that will be a permanent feature of
                local administration. I am sure the Education Committee will do
                its best to ensure that distribution of resources is fair.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Obviously, parents have the right to choose
                the schools to which their children go. We must consider that
                when looking at the distribution of capital funding as well as
                at the condition of the buildings.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There must be a review of the process and of
                the timetable in particular. Can we do anything to ensure that
                it is expedited in some way to prevent waits of 20 years or
                more? Any new procedures ought to ensure that the terms of the
                motion are honoured. The Education Committee will play its part
                in that. Members must ensure that distribution is fair and free
                from sectarianism.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr B Hutchinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I declare an interest. In my capacity as a
                Belfast city councillor, I am a member of the Belfast Education
                and Library Board (BELB) and have been part of decisions made on
                capital spending.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am somewhat surprised by the debate. I
                assumed that Members would take up sectarian positions. There is
                always an argument between Sinn Fein and the SDLP about who the
                real Republicans are and who the real Nationalists are. I was
                surprised to see that Sinn Fein deliberately missed out the
                private finance initiative. That party claims to be socialist,
                so PFI should be the first thing on its agenda. However, there
                is no mention of it, even though it is a major part of the
                capital spending plan.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister must adhere to certain criteria.
                Mr Danny Kennedy said in a recent article in the ‘Belfast
                Telegraph’ that he could not make a statement and then ignore
                what he had said. However, if I, as a member of the BELB,
                thought that the Minister had ignored criteria that would have
                put one of our schools to the top, there would be an argument
                with the Department of Education about that. In the Minister’s
                defence — people may wonder why I would defend him — the
                criteria have been well scrutinised. There are many sectors in
                the Department of Education, and we may need to look at that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is not about sectarian politics; it is
                about educational need. It does not matter whether a child is
                Chinese, Protestant or Catholic. All are entitled to an
                education. Mr Kennedy raised a valid point. SDLP Members talk
                about attacks on Catholic schools; Protestant schools have been
                attacked as well. Irrespective of whether a school is in need of
                repair or replacement, there is a morale problem among the
                teachers and pupils in such a school. That is a big problem. We
                must spend money to ensure that teachers do not work and
                children are not taught in such impossible conditions. We must
                ensure that educational need is met, and the criteria will help
                us to do that. The criteria should not be concerned with whether
                a school is Protestant, Catholic or integrated; they should be
                concerned only with the educational needs of children and how
                they can help their teachers to perform.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Wilson’s motion is rather paradoxical.
                We all agree with what he is saying, but we all know that the
                system cannot, in one sense, be &quot;equitable&quot;. If there
                are five Catholic schools that need attention before Protestant
                schools, or vice versa, that is the need that should be dealt
                with.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We cannot say &quot;We should take a
                Protestant school today and then a Catholic school&quot; and
                leave four other schools that may be in more need of attention,
                so there is a bit of a paradox. At the same time I sympathise
                with Sammy Wilson’s motion. How do we get this right? How do
                we ensure that someone does not run with his or her agenda?
                There are mechanisms in place to prevent that. The boards, while
                they continue — and how long they continue is an argument for
                another day when we may have more money — should scrutinise
                what happens, and we need to look at that too.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A number of points have been made, but the
                important one is that we act according to educational need, and
                I am not sure that we can ever get the Protestant/Catholic
                balance right.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People need to wake up to PFI. Private
                finance can be attracted to the Malone Road or Bangor, but
                attracting it to the Shankill or the Falls or any other
                working-class area is almost impossible.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Morrice:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to focus on an area that has not been
                mentioned enough in the debate, and that is integrated
                education. My Colleagues Eileen Bell, Billy Hutchinson and
                others did refer to it, and that is vital. This is about using
                increased money to satisfy parental demand. There has been talk
                about parents sending children to schools of their choice.
                Parents who want their children to go to integrated schools do
                not always have that choice, because there are not enough
                integrated schools in Northern Ireland to give it to them.
                Applications for places often have to be turned down.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That sector needs support. It is often said
                that the integrated sector is perceived as getting more than
                traditional sectors, a myth that I want to explode at the
                outset. Mr&nbsp;McElduff mentioned catching up. If we are
                talking about catching up, we are talking integrated education.
                That is what the integrated schools are doing — playing
                catch-up. We have only to compare the statistics for the various
                schools systems over the last 50 years — not the last 10 years
                or the last five years, but the last 50 years. Remember that the
                first integrated school, Lagan College, was set up less than 20
                years ago, in 1981. There is a desperate need for vastly
                increased funding for the integrated sector in order to ensure
                what Mr Wilson describes as &quot;a fair and equitable
                distribution of the capital spending budget&quot;.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another myth that I want to dispel is the
                claim that the integrated sector gets more than its fair share
                of the cake. We have 45 integrated schools. Thirty-one were set
                up from scratch by parents. When the Education Reform (Northern
                Ireland) Order 1989 came in, giving equity to integrated
                education, 10 integrated schools already existed. Two of those,
                Windmill Primary School, set up in 1988, and Omagh Primary
                School, in 1990, have had only mobile classrooms since their
                inception.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will not go into detail on this, because my
                Colleagues have covered it. We should focus on the need to
                educate Catholic and Protestant children together, which is
                stressed in the Good Friday Agreement and is hugely important
                for mutual respect and understanding. Children go to separate
                schools at the age of four and do not meet a child of another
                religion until they start work or third-level education.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to underline the need for integrated
                teacher training, the only area of third-level education that is
                segregated. We must move away from the past, with the old
                headcounts of Catholics and Protestants, and into a new future
                in which children of all religions learn to respect each other.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The position of the Women’s Coalition is
                that capital spending must take account of targeting social need
                and the historical imbalance due to the non-funding of sectors
                such as integrated education. We also have reservations about
                any major new capital expenditure, in any sector, before the
                review of post-primary education is complete.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Gallagher:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is much sub-standard accommodation in
                the schools estate that affects Protestants and Catholics, and
                any plea for a fair distribution of resources will be taken
                seriously by everyone.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr&nbsp;Wilson spoke of the seriousness of
                the matter. It reminded me of the situation a few years ago. For
                many years, as everyone knows, Catholic schools had to put up
                35% funding, then 15%. Eventually, the last Tory Education
                Minister gave Catholic schools 100% funding. There was one
                dissenting voice on that move: that of Mr&nbsp;Sammy Wilson, the
                proposer of today’s motion. I am glad that he now takes a
                wider view. For the sake of improving all our schools, that
                wider view is needed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Children are being educated in schools that
                resemble nineteenth-century institutions. Our priority must be
                to put an end to that situation; that would be to be really
                fair. If there are five such schools in the controlled sector
                and one in the maintained sector, or vice versa, we should
                tackle the problems in all six right away. Then we can have a
                serious debate about the equitable distribution of funding.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Like Mr Wilson, the Chairperson of the
                Education Committee referred to apparent unfairness. I shall
                listen to what is said. However, I have not heard any outcry
                from the education and library boards, who are responsible for
                prioritising capital projects in the controlled sector, about
                unfairness in the system. Perhaps, others have heard it. If so,
                we should listen to what they say and tackle the problem.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The PFI was rightly raised. It is not just
                the Department of Education; other Departments seem to be all
                for it. There is a great buzz about PFI. We are following other
                countries, not least England, but England is now pulling back
                from PFI arrangements because serious questions have arisen. Our
                Department of Education has not had a wide enough, or serious
                enough, debate about the implications for schools. They talk
                about entering into 25-year arrangements with private developers
                who will provide premises and collect rent. However, we have to
                look at the situation at year 15 and year 20.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Has the Department put controls in place that
                will ensure that, at the end of the agreement period, buildings
                will be in good condition and will have been value for money? It
                is all very well to tackle the problem in that way, but many
                working in education are not convinced that we have looked
                seriously enough at it. Many are worried about the advantages
                that appear to lie with the private developers under PFI.
                Developers will be able to choose the best projects. What will
                be left over? How will small schools, which have many of the
                most serious problems with accommodation, fare under PFI? We
                have had no debate on that, and I ask the Minister to note these
                concerns.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have already seen ripples around the
                development of PFI initiatives in Northern Ireland. They are a
                knock-on from problems that have surfaced in England where
                developers have had very imaginative ideas for developing
                property in close proximity to schools. This is not about
                filling stations — most pupils do not have cars — it is
                about developers providing attractions which will persuade
                children to part with some of their money, perhaps even their
                lunch money. This is an important issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that PFI will help to alleviate the
                problem, but I hope that we take on board the cautionary notes
                coming from elsewhere and do not store up problems for ourselves
                further down the road.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Poots:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I intend to speak for people who do not seem
                to have much of a voice nowadays — namely, the low-to-middle
                income families in the Province.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We hear a lot about targeting social need and
                those on the lowest incomes. Many resources have been geared
                towards helping such people. However, there is another group of
                people who are employed on low incomes. One partner may have a
                part-time job. They may own a house, but it may be cheaper to
                own than to rent a house. It may be cheaper to buy a mid-terrace
                or small semi-detached house. They may own a car, but it may be
                five or six years old and not worth very much.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If such people live in a rural community,
                they do not have public transport. They are often forgotten
                about because they do not fit into a particular set of criteria
                — the targeting social need criteria. Their children can go to
                school and be educated, occasionally in conditions little better
                than a dump. I hesitate to use the word, but on some occasions
                they are little better than a dump.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In my area there is a triangle that consists
                of mostly privately owned houses. Nevertheless, many of the
                people living there could not be classified as wealthy. In that
                area, in Moira, the school is full. The area has a good new
                school, and that is fine.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Maghaberry, they have a school that was
                built for 100 children but cannot take any more as 215 children
                are presently enrolled. Last year 46 children applied to enter
                P1, but only 30 could be accepted. There is planning permission
                for 300 new houses to be built, yet children have to go to
                schools outside the area. In Hillsborough, the school is full.
                It has 14 classes and only four permanent classrooms.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If every boy were to use the outside toilet
                during break, each would have just 15 seconds. That is happening
                in the leafy, affluent Hillsborough area. While many of the
                parents of these children may be affluent, others are not.
                Nevertheless, they are all entitled to be educated in good
                conditions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The area between is also important. Children
                are being taken from the area in which they live and to other
                areas because there are not enough schools there. There has been
                a proposal to amalgamate three schools in the west Hillsborough
                area — the Maze Primary School, St James’s Primary School
                and St John’s Primary School. In addition, Hillsborough
                Primary School needs 21-classroom accommodation, while
                Maghaberry Primary School needs at least three additional
                classrooms, although there is an apparent need for it to become
                a 14-classroom school. The Maze Primary School was built in
                1870. Only one of the school’s classrooms is not undersized,
                and storage space is at such a premium that they have to use the
                toilets. There is no vehicular access to the school, and parents
                have to park on the road when leaving children off. One child
                was knocked down last year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a similar situation at St James’s
                Primary School — children are being taught in composite
                classes. Again, the toilets are located outside, and classrooms
                are undersized. In addition, the damp-proofing course has not
                been successful, so you can smell damp, which is also evident in
                the finish of the wall. St John’s Primary School, which was
                built in 1853, also has temporary accommodation. One part of the
                school is in such disrepair that it can be only used for
                storage, and there are also outside toilets. There are no
                physical education facilities in any of these schools,and pupils
                have to travel to council facilities in buses because of that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a growing population in those areas,
                and the need for proper educational resources must be addressed.
                I get a little weary of hearing about the problems of inner-city
                areas. There are great problems there, but there are also major
                problems in rural areas that I want to highlight because
                children are being educated in substandard conditions. They do
                not live in a TSN area, but why should they be deprived of
                decent educational resources because their parents do not fit
                into the TSN category?</p>

                Minister is to strive towards equality, especially in the
                education system. One of our themes is the need to cherish all
                our children equally. The end goal is to achieve an equal
                society, and that was made possible by the Good Friday
                Agreement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Young people must be made part of that
                process. They must have access to skills training, which will
                allow them to gain proper, adequately-paid jobs rather than the
                low-paid work which many had to put up with in the past. They
                must feel included in society. Fair employment is needed on all
                levels. Young people must feel that education will lead to their
                being treated equitably when it is finished.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Personal development is an area that will
                probably need more spending in the years ahead. Education will
                also face changes, and preparing people through peace and
                reconciliation to deal with each other will put demands on the
                budget. These factors have a direct impact on capital spending.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As my Colleague Mr McElduff and others have
                said, a rebalancing of the past is an important theme that
                pervades the entire process. The education debate, and
                specifically capital spending from the point of view of Mr Sammy
                Wilson, must be decided in the context of how educational needs
                were dealt with in the past. The educational achievements of
                Nationalists over the last 30 years and before were nothing
                short of phenomenal, given the obstacles to education that were
                for so long put in their paths. Over the past 80 years in
                particular, the regime here was anything but forward-looking
                from the point of view of trying to prepare everybody, on a
                equal basis, for the future. In that time of one-party rule,
                underfunding was practised to establish control. Those mindsets
                from history may still exist now.</p>

                the Stormont Parliament, enabled all classes of people here to
                get a higher standard of education? The crucial factor in
                education throughout that period was the insistence of the Roman
                Catholic Church on total responsibility for the education of its
                children — an insistence that remains in spite of the fact
                that its schools now receive 100% funding. Does the Member

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McHugh:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While that was indeed enacted the fact that
                it was certainly not endorsed or fully implemented by the
                Government of the time had an effect, on the end result, which
                amounted to more of the same. Things changed because of
                pressures from society. It was more that than anything else that
                brought any change in how education was funded or the Government
                were forced to direct their funds. We faced a system in which
                there was gerrymandering and a skewing of resources to a large
                degree to one side of the community at all levels by the
                Government. A lack of jobs and proper housing, discrimination
                and injustice had an effect on the education system and on how
                people viewed it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Integrated and Irish-medium systems of
                education were ignored, and that imbalance must be redressed.
                That is why Irish-medium education was mentioned in the Good
                Friday Agreement and why funding has to go towards it. An
                earlier contributor made the argument for integrated education.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The capital allowed for by the present budget
                is insufficient, given the backdrop that I have described. The
                Blair Government, who purport to back education so much, have
                not been prepared to back the post-conflict situation and put
                schools here on a par with those in Britain.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are serious accommodation problems in
                many schools that need to be addressed. Continually bad
                conditions in schools adversely affect the morale of teachers
                and pupils, who are trying to achieve high standards. They do
                not have the right tools, and this serious situation must be
                resolved.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">PFIs must be discussed by the Education
                Committee and the Assembly. People are concerned that they seem
                to be being almost pushed down our throats as the only way of
                delivering a capital programmes for schools. We must have
                control and ensure that we do not lose it or long- fought-for
                assets.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The delivery of the programme is important.
                What we do now will have a major impact on our children’s
                futures, and everything must be done to meet everyone’s needs
                on an equal basis. Past difficulties have to be redressed, but
                we must also work towards the competitive market and educate our
                students to face the world and all its problems.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker, I thought I had escaped - <i>[Laughter].</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When listening to Ms&nbsp;Morrice I
                remembered attending a national school on a first floor. The
                principal and his family lived on the ground floor. That could
                have been called a high school or college of technology. Older
                generations in rural areas attended mixed schools, and my father
                would declare that mixed schools were great because you learned
                exactly what the opposition was like from childhood.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, I would like to deal with Catholic
                underfunding. When representatives from the integrated sector
                came to lobby the Committee they produced a document that
                referred to Bishop&nbsp;Boyle of 1830. When I pointed out that
                he had been an Establishment placement, they were shocked. I
                reminded them of Cardinal Connell who declared 150&nbsp;years
                ago that there should be Catholic education in Catholic schools
                by Catholic teachers. In 1922, Lord Londonderry wrote to
                Cardinal O’Donnell on education. The cardinal replied:
                &quot;Dear Sir, We have our own education system.&quot; People
                say that they want their own ethos — and they are entitled to
                that — but they want someone else to pay for it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Because of the poor quality of education that
                was being delivered, the Northern Ireland Government, in spite
                of constant barraging, felt compelled to move from 65% grant aid
                up to almost 100% grant aid. The Council for Catholic Maintained
                Schools has raised the standard of Catholic education and is to
                be congratulated. The funding figures that are available for the
                past five years do prove a glaring point. In 1995-96, of a total
                of £60·5&nbsp;million, £7·7&nbsp;million went to the
                controlled sector. In 1996-97, of a total of
                £47·2&nbsp;million, the controlled sector received
                £16·9&nbsp;million.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the year that was mentioned, 1997-98, the
                sum was as low as £23 million, of which £4·9&nbsp;million
                went to the controlled sector. Three years ago, in 1998-99, it
                received £3·8&nbsp;million out of £32&nbsp;million. The final
                sum announced in 1999-2000 by Tony Worthington was
                £67&nbsp;million, of which the controlled sector got
                £16·7&nbsp;million. When Mr McElduff from my constituency
                hailed the announcement of £72&nbsp;million this time last year
                as a great success, I examined the figures and found that
                £14·4&nbsp;million of that figure had already been announced
                by Worthington, reducing the figure to £57&nbsp;million —
                more than £10&nbsp;million less than was announced by
                Worthington. Someone should get the right, or we shall be
                writing &quot;Learn to count&quot; on the bottom of that report.
                These facts explain the skewing of the figures.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My stance is not anti-Catholic nor
                anti-Catholic school. Rather, the skewing of figures against the
                majority sector has been so great recently that the Unionist
                community feels that it does not count. It feels that there has
                been an attack on its ethos. Unionist people consider education
                a treasured asset and feel that their very being is under
                attack, and not just because of 30&nbsp;years of physical
                violence and the blowing up and destruction of their property.
                They perceive this to be the case, particularly given last year’s
                announcements and the perception continues to be perpetuated:
                out of the supposed £72&nbsp;million, which is not an accurate
                figure, the controlled schools received less than
                £25&nbsp;million. Everything was going to be transparent and
                open with the new beginning. It is so visible that even the
                stupidest person can see that that was not so much phoney
                accountancy as &quot;ropy adding&quot;, as Sammy Wilson called
                it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the other areas I mentioned was the
                clamour by the mediocre. Everyone wants the best education he
                can get. We know that there is a difficulty over the amount of
                money, but I would like to have heard of something being done to
                redress the backlog worth at least £1&nbsp;billion. At least
                £500&nbsp;million is needed for new building and
                £500&nbsp;million for urgent repairs. If we agree that that
                must be dealt with, let us look at the American system, which is
                not always good, not always great. We are talking about
                provision, and surely public and private partnerships could give
                us some help here.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Irrespective of the fears expressed by Mr
                B&nbsp;Hutchinson and others, I dearly want private finance
                initiatives in rural areas because I speak, as Mr&nbsp;Poots has
                spoken, for rural schools. I speak for schools all over west
                Tyrone, which are small and old and where all pupils use outside
                toilets that would horrify the urbanites. That is a fact of life
                in rural areas. I would like to see us, with public- private
                partnership, being able to cluster schools into a contractual
                package that could lead to the provision we need.</p>

                that my eight minutes are up. I can make my other points
                quickly. There is a perception in my community that must be
                dealt with. The people whom I represent feel that there is such
                a skewing away from the controlled sector that they are being
                ignored and their voice counts for nothing. I want that noted
                this afternoon.</p>

                I am glad that the debate has taken place. It was in doubt
                earlier. Many people will remember Mr&nbsp;S Wilson saying some
                time ago that he intended to be like a Rottweiler at the heel of
                the Minister. The Rottweiler was 15 minutes late. I thought I
                would have to send out a search party for him and had visions of
                him coming up the steps on all fours, with his tongue hanging
                out. However, his speech turned out to be more of a yelp than an
                attack.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the opportunity to respond to both
                the motion and the points raised. I also welcome the opportunity
                to put it on record that fairness and equity are key principles
                in my approach to education issues. I can confirm that the
                capital budget of the Department of Education is not determined
                on a religious or sectoral basis. Resources are directed to
                priority educational need, in whatever sector.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The largest part of the capital budget is
                directed to major capital work across all sectors, but
                substantial funds enable education and library boards to
                undertake minor capital work in controlled schools. Funds are
                available to meet boards’ responsibilities for furnishing and
                equipping controlled and maintained schools, school transport
                and accommodation. My Department also grant-aids approved
                expenditure on minor capital work in voluntary and
                grant-maintained integrated schools.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I have said before, I am committed to
                improving the schools estate, but the number of major projects
                competing for a place in the capital programme far exceeds my
                available resources. Each year’s school building programme is
                directed towards new schools, rationalisation, the replacement
                of substandard accommodation and ensuring that pupils and
                teachers have a proper learning environment. The available
                resources are directed to the highest priorities, based on
                educational need. It is important for people to understand that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also wish to comment on statements about
                imbalances in how capital funds are allocated. I refute any
                suggestion of inequality in those allocations, which are based
                solely on educational need. In any one year the allocation may
                favour one sector or another. However, Members should note that
                since 1990-91 the capital programme has been spread over 50
                controlled schools, 43 maintained schools, 18 voluntary grammar
                schools, three Irish-medium schools and six integrated schools.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Contrary to popular belief, no decisions have
                yet been taken on next year’s capital programme. I will be
                meeting the Education Committee next week, and I hope to
                announce the programme once I have heard and considered its
                views. The criteria for determining the programme will include
                educational priority, planning readiness, estimated costs,
                affordability and, not least, the capital resources available.
                The key factor is educational need, which is informed from a
                number of sources, principal of which is the capital planning
                list, which contains over 100 projects in categories one to
                three.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The criteria for each are clear. Category one
                provides for additional schools on identified sites or
                extensions to existing schools where there is clear evidence of
                insufficient places to accommodate pupils at suitable schools in
                a defined area. Category two provides for rationalisation
                proposals, which replace substandard accommodation and are
                essential to effect the rationalisation. Category three provides
                for schools that suffer significantly as a result of several
                serious accommodation inadequacies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Projects in category one, which are
                sufficiently advanced in planning, have first priority for
                available resources, followed by projects in categories two and
                three. There are 108 projects in categories one to three on the
                planning list, representing 57 primary and post-primary schools
                in the voluntary sector — Catholic maintained, voluntary
                grammar and Irish-medium. There are 36 primary and post-primary
                projects in the controlled sector, representing 11 special and
                four grant-maintained integrated schools.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In drawing up the initial planning list, my
                Department consults with the education and library boards, the
                Council for Catholic Maintained Schools, the Northern Ireland
                Council for Integrated Education and individual school
                authorities. The Department subsequently consults the boards and
                the council representing the majority of schools on the planning
                list about their capital priorities. I consider that to be an
                important step since both have a specific statutory
                responsibility in their respective sectors.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Within the Department, advice is also sought
                from the education and training inspectorate and the Department’s
                professional advisers about the relative educational needs of
                the competing priorities. Projects competing for a place on the
                conventional procurement programme must also be sufficiently
                advanced in design planning to be considered for a place on the
                programme.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The availability of resources is obviously
                the determining factor in the number that can be included in any
                year’s programme. However, the present backlog of school
                building projects, which currently amounts to some £500
                million, cannot be addressed by conventional procurement methods
                alone.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am looking at the possibility of addressing
                some of that backlog through the private finance initiative. I
                understand the concerns and the reservations that people have
                expressed about that. To go down that route would obviously mean
                the conventional school building programme being complemented by
                the selective use of PFI in appropriate cases, to permit greater
                progress in meeting accommodation needs across the schools
                estate than would otherwise be the case. I hope that that
                information gives Members a better understanding of the
                allocation of my Department’s capital budget and the
                difficulties that it faces in trying to meet the needs of all
                schools.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I cannot deal with all points raised but I
                will deal with one or two. Mr Wilson mentioned Regent House. The
                original announcement was made under the Chancellor’s
                announcement, which assumed income from the sale of land —
                Scrabo High School and Belfast port. Neither of those
                transactions took place so no income was received, and money had
                to be found from elsewhere in the budget.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to the point raised by Mr Kennedy
                on the situation at Strabane, I will clarify the position and, I
                hope, clear up the misunderstanding and confusion, which
                prompted an article in the ‘Belfast Telegraph’. My decision
                to approve the development proposal for the amalgamation of
                Convent Grammar School, Our Lady of Mercy High School and St
                Colman’s High School to form a new school was taken under the
                statutory provisions of the Education and Libraries (Northern
                Ireland) Order 1986. A development proposal must be published
                where a new school is to be established or where significant
                changes are proposed to existing schools. It gives interested
                parties an opportunity to voice any objections before a decision
                on the proposal is reached. Far from undermining the mechanism
                in place, I was fulfilling my statutory responsibilities in that
                case.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The development proposal for the amalgamation
                of the three schools should not be confused with the Department’s
                capital programme, which I announce annually. Only after a
                development proposal is approved and an economic appraisal
                undertaken can a building project can be considered under the
                capital programme. So, if the development proposal had not been
                approved, or if its approval had been delayed, the project could
                not have been considered for the capital programme and would
                have come to a standstill. The Strabane project will be
                considered alongside other priorities for a place in the capital
                programme, in the light of the resources available. However, no
                decisions have been taken about the make-up of the next capital
                programme. People will have to await the outcome of all of that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Kennedy made an important point. For many
                decades we have had neglect and underfunding in education. We
                can see that in the state of the schools estate. It is difficult
                to deal with all these matters against the background of the
                heavy backlog of work that needs to be done.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Lewsley referred to PFI, TSN and social
                deprivation. The Department assesses all these matters and the
                state of the schools estate, and I hope that my statement to the
                House has cleared up the Department’s and my approach to all
                this. There are too many mobile classrooms, but these are all a
                result of the nderfunding and neglect that we have had for many
                years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department has been involved in
                pathfinder projects, but PFI is at a fledgling stage. We have
                attempted to use our limited resources in the best way possible.
                My officials are tough negotiators, and under no circumstances
                will they use public money on schemes that will make fat cats
                fatter.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An example of that is the collapse of the
                recent Classroom 2000 negotiations where, clearly, we decided
                that the deal on offer was unacceptable. Some hard and tough
                negotiations took place during the course of that. Our people
                stood their ground, and in the end we did not go for the
                proposed deal.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to rural schools, I agree with Ms
                Lewsley about the importance of ensuring that they are treated
                with equality and fairness.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Bell raised Clifton Special School, and
                there are other special schools. That is something close to my
                heart. I have visited that school and a number of others, and I
                am very much taken by the need to support the teachers, parents
                and pupils. Ultimately, judgement will be made on the Assembly
                and the Executive, and we will be judged on how we treat the
                most disadvantaged people. I am conscious of my responsibilities
                with regard to those very special children.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People know where I stand on integrated
                education. I have a duty and responsibility as Minister to
                encourage and facilitate parents who choose integrated education
                for their children, and I intend to support those people the
                whole way down the line. Ms Morrice reiterated the point about
                integrated education. It is vital that my Department co-operates
                with NICIE to ensure that we deal with the demand of parents.
                Certainly when people come forward with robust proposals, we
                will support them. A good example of that recently is our
                lowering of the viability criteria, which makes it possible for
                such schools to start up more easily. We are making progress on
                that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Gallagher made an important point when he
                said that there are no criticisms coming from the education and
                library boards. That needs to be taken on board by people who
                come to the House and make totally erroneous claims about
                unfairness or injustice with the distribution of capital
                resources.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.00 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There was a great contrast between Mr Sammy
                Wilson’s speech, which was completely over the top, totally
                wrong and unjustified, and that made by Mr Edwin Poots, which
                was positive and constructive. It contained no hint whatsoever
                of criticism of any bias against one section of the community or
                the other. He dealt with the important issue of rural schools
                and said that there are people who feel that officials in the
                Department are anxious to deal with their concerns — whatever
                they may be.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Poots mentioned three schools in the
                Hillsborough area that date back to the mid-1800s — Maze
                Primary School, St James’s Primary School and St John’s
                Primary School. Yesterday afternoon I met with a cross-party
                delegation of Members from that area to discuss the proposed
                amalgamation of the three schools. They will have high priority
                in the next capital programme. Mr Poots’s speech was
                constructive, and that is the way forward, folks. The best way
                for DUP Members to represent their constituents’ concerns, or
                perceived concerns, is to talk to me about them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Under no circumstances will I preside over a
                Department that attempts to treat any child unjustly, be he from
                the Shankill Road, Portadown, Hillsborough, Coalisland, Maghera
                or Derry city. That is the past. I want to move on in a new
                spirit of friendship with everybody, including Sammy Wilson and
                the DUP, and try to build the new future that the vast majority
                of children and parents crave. Go raibh maith agat.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr S Wilson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker, the Minister and his party
                said that they that welcomed the debate, yet at the start they
                protested and hoped that you would rule it out of order because
                of my late arrival. That probably said more about their real
                intentions than their words did. Of course, Sinn Féin is good
                with words. I was almost in tears during the final, impassioned
                plea from the Minister: &quot;Please come and talk to me. I want
                to be your friend.&quot; His party cannot be friends with people
                from his own community. It goes around bashing them every night,
                yet he entreats us and says that he wants to be our friend.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I heard what he said about fairness and
                treating people with justice. We hear that from Sinn Féin on
                everything. It says that it wants the guns out of politics, yet
                holds onto its arms caches for dear life. It says that it wants
                justice, yet bashes people in Nationalist areas every night. We
                hear the weasel words &quot;We want the funds distributed
                fairly&quot;, but do not judge it by its words; judge it by its
                actions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister, despite attempts to do so at
                the end of his speech, was not able to deny that he padded last
                year’s figures to disguise the fact that one education sector
                was treated three times better than another sector. That sector
                just happens to be the one used by the community that I
                represent.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While the Minister tried to keep up the
                impression of wanting to be fair, he could not convey that
                message to the lieutenants sitting behind him. Barry McElduff
                and Gerry McHugh talked about the injustices of the past. Note
                the words: &quot;The difficulties of the past have to be
                redressed.&quot; The implication is that spending allocations
                must be skewed towards one sector, and justification for that is
                spurious.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Oliver Gibson gave the figures for the last
                five years. There is no historical imbalance. The non-100%
                capital funding in the past is not unique. Republicans feel they
                must whinge about discrimination — it is almost obligatory.
                The voluntary sector chose to be independent and paid the same
                penalty. It did not get 100% funding. The big, bad Unionists did
                not discriminate against poor, downtrodden Nationalists. There
                was a price for independence, and it was paid by all sectors
                that chose that route. So let us dispense with the nonsense that
                is trotted out ad nauseam by people who ignore the historical
                facts.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On PFI the Minister and his lieutenants have
                not got their stories straight again. I sometimes wonder just
                where the lieutenants operate. Gerry McHugh was concerned
                because Billy Hutchinson taunted him about his socialist
                credentials. Mr McHugh said that Sinn Féin was concerned about
                PFI and that we need to debate the matter. Clearly he did not
                realise that that is actually what we are talking about —
                perhaps we should have used Irish. I do not know.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We did discuss PFI in the Committee. We had a
                presentation with plenty of documentation from officials.
                Furthermore, we responded to the Minister on PFI. I did not
                notice any dissent from Sinn Féin — its members agreed that
                PFI should be used in certain circumstances. Now Gerry McHugh is
                wringing his hands and saying that we need a debate on that
                because Billy Hutchinson taunted him.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If there is a £500 million backlog, we must
                look at innovative ways of dealing with it. PFI may not suit
                certain areas, but it does suit other areas. It is important
                that we do not rely simply on public funding to deal with that,
                and the Department is right to look at the possibility of using
                private finance to help.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I had no doubt that Eileen Bell, a zealot on
                this, and Jane Morrice would use the debate to promote
                integrated education saying that as people are queuing up to get
                into such schools we should spend money on them. By that
                definition, we should be throwing money at nearly every grammar
                school because people are queuing to get into them, and hundreds
                of children are being turned away every year. We should
                certainly not be spending money on integrated schools when there
                is under-capacity in the existing system, whether in maintained
                or controlled schools. It is madness to spend money on an
                alternative system when plenty of places are available in state
                or maintained schools.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I accused the Minister of fancy financial
                rope tricks, and it seems once again that he is trying to
                mislead or direct attention away from the imbalance. He talked
                about the number of controlled schools that had benefited from
                spending on capital projects. He is correct inasmuch as last
                year more controlled schools than maintained schools benefited
                from capital expenditure. However, when two controlled schools
                are given £700,000, two are given £1·2 million and another is
                given £1·3 million, you can make the figures tell whatever
                story you wish.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Eleven schools in the sector that caters for
                Protestants benefited from capital spending compared with six
                schools in the sector that caters for Catholics. However,
                £13·3 million was spent on the former while £40·3 million
                was spent on the latter. The Minister can use whatever fancy
                footwork he wants to, but there was an imbalance.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Tommy Gallagher said that we must look at the
                state of school buildings. I am happy to do that. Figures for
                schemes that were introduced and are now in contention were made
                available to Tommy Gallagher and me. For the last six years
                there was not much difference between the two sectors, but there
                are massive differences with capital spending. I am happy for
                the issue to be judged on that basis.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The problem exists because we have a Minister
                who reflects the views of the lieutenants who sit behind him. He
                wants to redress the perceived problems of the past, and that is
                why there is an imbalance in his spending. That is why the
                Assembly should be demanding fairness and equity.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Students ought to be the beneficiaries of our
                education system and not victims of it. Unfortunately, the
                present system of a debt-burdened educational process is making
                victims of our student body. Education is as much a part of our

                physical manifestations. The absence of people who are educated
                in the arts and the sciences diminishes our physical
                infrastructure, however grandiose that infrastructure may be.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Education is as fundamental to the good order
                of our society as the family unit, so the arguments against
                tuition fees are as strong today as they ever were. Tuition fees
                are wrong. They do not raise extra funds for higher education,
                and the Government’s current tuition fee regime represents the
                thin edge of the wedge, which may eventually lead to the
                introduction of top-up fees and full-cost fees. Student hardship
                is a harsh reality that has been consistently ignored by
                successive Governments. The discretionary award has been reduced
                from £6&nbsp;million in 1997-98 to £3·3&nbsp;million in
                1999-2000, thus creating major hardship for students wishing to
                take up second-chance courses and vocational postgraduate
                qualifications.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Student unions are campaigning for a system
                of funding that will give students enough money to live on while
                they study without the need to resort to additional debt,
                low-paid jobs and further parental assistance. We do not have a
                properly funded education system, and students and parents are
                being made to suffer rather than being enhanced by it. The NUS/USI
                (National Union of Students/ Union of Students in Ireland) has
                clear ideas about the guiding objectives for the future delivery
                of student support. Any review of student funding must be tested
                against these objectives as they are the features that NUS/USI
                believe should be central to any funding regime. A new system
                should alleviate student hardship through maintenance and
                benefit support, increase and widen access to further and higher
                education, bridge the inequalities between funding for further
                and higher education, ensure equitable funding for both
                part-time and full-time study and enhance the quality of
                education on offer.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those are laudable objectives that any
                society should aspire to. With regard to student hardship, the
                NUS/USI student income and expenditure survey of 1998 found that
                20% of a sample of students in Northern Ireland owed more than
                £4,000 to the Student Loans Company. Students in further
                education only receive on average £656&nbsp;a year in grants,
                student loans and parental contributions, yet they have an
                annual expenditure of approximately £3,000,&nbsp;a shortfall of
                £2,344 a&nbsp;year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Average student debt is increasing. The
                Barclays Bank student debt survey 1998 revealed that graduates
                expect to have an average debt of £4,497. The findings showed
                that the cost of attending university has increased by 103%
                since 1994, while graduate salaries have increased by just 17%.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The NUS student hardship survey of 1999 found
                that 73·3% of full-time undergraduates, 71·4% of part-time
                undergraduates and 76·6% of postgraduates were in debt. In
                addition, mature students have substantially more debt than
                other students. Student hardship is forcing increasing numbers
                of students to withdraw from their courses and damaging the
                quality of academic life. A survey commissioned by the NUS and
                the GMB trade union in October&nbsp;1995 found that 40% of
                students worked on average between 12·5 and 20&nbsp;hours a
                week during term time. Two thirds of those students said that
                such employment affected their studies - 30% missed lectures and
                20% failed to submit coursework due to the pressures imposed by
                part-time employment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A follow-up survey specific to the North of
                Ireland was carried out by the NUS/USI students’ centre in
                1998. Was it found that 60% of students relied on part-time
                work, working an average of 17·7 hours a week. This adds to the
                difficulties of students attempting to pay their way through
                university.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Students in the North of Ireland,
                particularly mature students, are more vulnerable to the
                increased cost of higher education. Mature students,
                particularly working-class men, are discouraged from entering
                higher education by tuition fees. According to the Universities
                and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS) September 1999 figures,
                applications from mature students aged between 21 and 24 were
                3·4% lower than the previous year, with a drop of 6·6% in
                students aged 25 or over.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the North of Ireland, the proportion of
                mature students in higher education has always been much lower
                than in Great Britain. In 1997-98, mature students comprised
                only 18% of the student population, while the equivalent figure
                in England and the rest of Ireland was 28%.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Research evidence from Profs Cormack,
                Gallagher and Osborne of the Centre for Research on Higher
                Education at Queen’s University confirmed that the
                participation rate of Northern Ireland students is more
                sensitive to financial issues than for students from Great
                Britain because of the social class profile of the student
                population here. They argue that the recent changes to the
                system of student financial support could have a more
                detrimental impact on the participation rates of our students.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The majority of the public and local
                politicians opposed the introduction of tuition fees, and there
                is substantial public support for the campaign against them. The
                study ‘Social Attitudes in Northern Ireland: the Fourth Report’
                by Breen, Devine and Robinson (1995) found that among a sample
                of the public, 79% believed that the Government should pay
                tuition fees, with only 17% saying that students should
                contribute. The vast majority of local politicians, MPs and
                councils opposed the introduction of tuition fees. The Northern
                Ireland Forum for Political Dialogue also strongly condemned the
                proposals.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Government and education experts recognise
                the need for adequate funding for students. The Dearing Report
                on higher education says</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;We are concerned however, that the
                combined value of the grant and state student loan together
                should not fall behind a level adequate to meet students’
                necessary expenditure.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In its manifesto document ‘Lifelong
                Learning’ the Labour Party says that one of the priorities for
                lifelong learning must be to tackle student hardship. During the
                debate on the Teaching and Higher Education Bill on 8 June 1998,
                David Blunkett assured MPs</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;We are talking about ensuring that
                students have the money at the point when they need it, and that
                they repay it when they can afford to do so … We are talking
                about a provision to ensure that no one is in hardship at
                university.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">More recently, the Cubie Report said</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;We have no doubt that the student or
                parental contribution to tuition fees in full-time higher
                education should be abolished for Scottish students … We are
                clear, as we have listened to Scotland, that the present
                arrangements are broadly discredited, add to anxieties about
                debt and create undue anomalies.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The loss of social security benefits for
                students increases hardship. For a student under 25 years of
                age, financial support amounts to a maximum loan of £3,635 a
                year, or £69·90 a week. State benefits for a person of the
                same age are: income support of £41·35 a week and housing
                benefit of £45 a week, a total of £86·35. Students under 25
                receive an additional £16·45 a week if on income support and
                housing benefit, or £855·40 a year. That is more than they
                would get if they were not students.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issue is the cost of participating in
                education. Health care, books, periodicals, special equipment,
                art materials, computer software, examinations, stationery,
                photocopying, travel and miscellaneous costs add up to a heavy
                debt for students and their families. If a son or daughter comes
                home from university and says that he or she needs this or that,
                it is very difficult to deny it. Young people are not just
                furthering their education; they are giving an added dimension
                to society.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Most parents believe in, and lobby for, free
                education because education is a cornerstone of society.
                Education enhances society and puts more, or as much, into it as
                those who have an education get out of it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the chronology of events on student
                financial support we go back to 1947, mentioned in the last
                debate. How many people of my age who had free education would
                not have had a second or third-level education but for the
                Education (Northern Ireland) Act 1947? I have to ask, as parents
                and the public ask, about where the money comes from. If my
                generation, and the generation that many in the House belong to,
                were able to have free education, why can the children of this
                generation not? Why should we disadvantage this generation by
                taking away from them the advantages we had?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If education is as fundamental to society as
                the family unit, the burden of debt ought to be removed in so
                far as possible from children and young people and from parents
                who cannot afford to keep them. How many young people drop out
                of third-level education because they cannot cope with the debt?
                How many young people do not go into third-level education
                because they are afraid of debt?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Higher and Further
                Education, Training and Employment Committee (Dr Birnie):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is an important matter. Some of the
                points that will emerge this afternoon were considered at length
                in the debate on the Committee’s report last November. Members
                were also able to raise issues during the Budget debates.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nevertheless, there have been interesting
                developments on student debt recently. The motion refers to
                student debt rather than to the other, albeit related, issue of
                tuition fees. Two particularly important pieces of evidence have
                been released, one in December 2000 and the other earlier this
                month. The Callender and Kemp study, commissioned by the
                Department for Education and Employment, indicates that in
                1998-99 the average net level of debt for students across the
                United Kingdom lay between £1,500 and £5,000 — the actual
                amounts varying with the background and circumstances of the
                individual student. Those figures could be worse, given the
                removal of the maintenance grants since then, although we do not
                know for sure. However, we must bear that in mind during today’s
                debate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, there is an ongoing inquiry by the
                House of Commons Education Select Committee. Its investigations
                seem to indicate that the existence of student debt, or at least
                the perception or fear of it, is a significant deterrent to
                students, particularly those from a low-income background. Hence
                we see an obstacle to achieving the wider access to higher and
                further education that we desire.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The House of Commons is also indicating —
                and we should pay special attention to this — that the impact
                of debt is leading to an increase in drop-out rates in UK higher
                education institutions. Again it seems that students coming from
                lower-income or disadvantaged backgrounds are hardest hit. It is
                undesirable, socially iniquitous and a waste of the valuable and
                limited resources within higher education if students drop out
                once they are in the system and fail to complete their degrees
                or other courses.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What then can be done? Towards the end of
                last year the Committee for Higher and Further Education,
                Training and Employment produced a package of proposals to deal
                with these problems. The Committee believes that these proposals
                represent a contribution on the behalf of students from
                lower-income backgrounds and would, if implemented, act as a
                deterrent against their dropping out.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We placed great emphasis on expanding the
                number of student places in the Province partly because some
                potential students would prefer to stay here than move to Great
                Britain, the Republic of Ireland or further afield. It is
                cheaper for them to stay in Northern Ireland than move away from
                home.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Then, in December, the Minister announced his
                proposals for this broad area. On behalf of the Committee, I
                welcome them as a start in dealing with some of the more serious
                problems that relate to student support and widening social
                access to further and higher education. In due course, more
                detail will be required on his reformed package. This will
                include the level of the reintroduced maintenance grants or
                bursaries. It will also detail how the means-testing system will
                operate in respect of such support and what the interaction will
                be between student support and the wider social security system
                — a UK-wide issue that the interdepartmental working group is
                working on. Given the Minister’s proposals, how will selective
                assistance, particularly for further education students, for
                areas of skills shortages operate? Furthermore, how will it
                operate given the commitment to equity and social need?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need adequate implementation of the
                package of proposals that we first heard about in mid-December.
                That will involve the Department of Higher and Further
                Education, Training and Employment working in close conjunction
                with the Department of Finance and Personnel. Indeed, in the
                medium to long term, it will involve the entire Executive
                because the indications in December suggested that a substantial
                amount of the additional funding required will come through the
                mechanism of Executive programme funds. I endorse the sentiments
                of the motion.</p>

                immense relevance to the student body and their families.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee for Higher and Further
                Education, Training and Employment welcomed the Minister’s
                recent announcement on student finance in so far as it goes. We
                have still to learn the details of the proposals and the impact
                they will have on student debt. We await those details from the
                Department.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is overwhelming evidence that debt in
                the student population has now reached unprecedented levels.
                Survey after survey has shown this, and the Chairperson referred
                to the most recent survey carried out on behalf of the
                Department for Education and Employment by Callender and Kemp.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Personal interviews with 2,800 students
                representing full-time and part-time undergraduates throughout
                the United Kingdom confirmed that more students owed much larger
                sums of money to a broader range of creditors last year than
                they did three years ago. The report concluded that almost 90%
                of students face financial difficulties. By the end of the
                1998-99 academic year, full-time students anticipated owing
                three times as much as students in 1995-96 — just three years
                earlier and prior to the introduction of the student loan
                scheme.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Regrettably, higher and further education has
                become associated with debt. Surely there is not one Member who
                has not been told by constituents, or indeed family members or
                friends, that they may not be able to afford to send their
                children to university because of the lack of financial support.
                Many families are guilt-ridden because of their inability to
                support their children through education without recourse to
                student loans. Callender reported that 35% of students surveyed
                had to pay the full £1,000 parental contribution towards their
                fees themselves.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Callender Report also highlighted an
                increase in overall borrowing by students, including borrowing
                from financial institutions and on credit cards, often at rates
                of interest that can only be described as usurious. Whichever
                figures you rely on, on graduation our young people face a wall
                of debt, repayable at a time when they may be considering
                marriage, buying a house or starting a family.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Debt can have a corrosive influence on family
                life. It does not impact solely on an individual student; there
                are major implications for the whole family. For many, servicing
                debt is the first call on family resources. Once a cycle of debt
                is entered into, it requires considerable skill to manage it and
                break the cycle of ever-increasing borrowing. All financial
                institutions realise this. Financial behaviour learnt at an
                early age lasts through life. That is why credit card companies
                and banks target students.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The old adage &quot;Neither a borrower nor a
                lender be&quot; was once considered good advice to pass on to
                children. Today’s students seem far more attuned to the idea
                of credit than were previous generations. In many cases they do
                so without fully realising their responsibility to discharge
                that debt, which will be done from a position of weakness when
                many will be entering into domestic and financial commitments
                associated with adult life.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I cannot advocate this as a good development,
                and many share my concerns. It is wrong to launch students into
                the world of work with an albatross of debt around their necks.
                The Committee for Higher and Further Education, Training and
                Employment report on student finance shows the balance between
                what is affordable and our desire to enable everyone to have
                access to lifelong learning. We deliberately sought assurances
                that resources would be ring-fenced for student finance, having
                identified the fear of debt and the wall of debt to be tackled.
                The Committee will support the Minister’s new proposals if
                they will clearly have an impact on removing the fear of debt
                and reducing its level. Members would like to have provided more
                generous support for students, but there is a limit on the funds
                allocated to Northern Ireland and many other groups who also
                need help.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, we must aim to change the perception
                that a degree is the only route to well-paid employment and job
                satisfaction. People can become trapped in a cycle of debt
                because of problems with literacy, numeracy and a lack of basic
                skills. They have low expectations, and they are constrained to
                low-paid employment with no hope of breaking out of the cycle.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dallat:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the opportunity to participate in
                this debate and to reiterate my party’s commitment to
                addressing the issue of student debt. As someone who has spent
                30 years in the teaching profession at different levels, both
                here and in the Republic, I attach a great deal of importance to
                the needs of students. In the short time that the Minister has
                been in office, there has been broad support for what he has
                been able to do, given the competing needs for a finite budget.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.45 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I invite the Minister to reaffirm that he
                will continue to treat this issue as a priority. I also ask him
                to return to the Committee for Higher and Further Education,
                Training and Employment at an early date to discuss further his
                proposals of 15&nbsp;December. Dr Farren acknowledged then that
                living costs are a key issue for students in third-level
                education and that those living costs cannot be addressed
                without looking at the needs of the most disadvantaged people
                — those on low incomes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The announcement on 15 December gave rise to
                broad agreement from the vice-chancellors of the two
                universities that the £65 million package would result in a
                fairer and more stable community through inclusion. The Students’
                Union president at Queen’s University, Mr&nbsp;Paul Callaghan,
                said that the package would take nearly three out of every five
                students out of fee-paying. Mr Callaghan went on to welcome the
                assistance for mature students and the streamlining of
                procedures for student loans.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that the Minister can reaffirm his
                commitment to do everything possible to address student debt
                because that is a priority for the Assembly Committee. The issue
                of student support set a precedent for the way in which
                important business is dealt with by the Assembly and has shown
                the importance of having local, accountable and responsible
                institutions. The concept of consensus government is innovative,
                and there will inevitably be criticisms. That in itself is no
                bad thing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, we cannot have the luxury of power
                to make demands without the responsibility that goes with that
                power. The Executive agreed the package of £65 million of new
                money for students in need. It targets social need, and nobody
                would disagree with that. The package addresses debt by
                reintroducing grants and introducing specific measures such as
                childcare grants and selective fee remission. No one could argue
                with those measures, and I ask the Minister to pledge his
                continued support to keep this issue a priority. The students’
                unions have highlighted the need to increase and widen access to
                further and higher education. That has been done.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I ask the Minister to say what additional
                places will be available in the universities so that fewer
                students have to travel abroad for education.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Prof Paddy Murphy, Director of the Belfast
                Institute of Further and Higher Education, has welcomed the
                abolition of fees for full-time further education students in
                key skills. He has predicted that the increased spending on
                further education will assist strategic planning for higher
                education places for selected industries, and we are all agreed
                that these are key to Northern Ireland’s economic growth.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since 1984, there has been a consistent
                attack on the assistance given to students. In 1997, when Labour
                had its landslide victory, we all hoped for improvements, but
                within two months the Dearing Report was published, recommending
                that graduates contribute to their fees. Since then other
                draconian measures have been taken to which my party and I are
                fundamentally opposed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly has enabled a locally elected
                Minister to begin to address issues that have caused students
                great hardship. He has been able to include groups that have
                been ignored in the past and to target social need. The battle
                will continue. The SDLP has a long and proud record of forming
                and advocating policies to equip young people with the highest
                standards of education and training. These are the most powerful
                weapons available to address injustices of the past.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This motion enables the Minister to reaffirm
                his commitment to these ideals, and for that reason I support
                it.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Neeson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Perhaps I should declare an interest in that
                I have a son and daughter at university. However, I recognise
                the sensitivity of the issue and how important it is to many
                young people. Third-level education is a human right. As we move
                into the new society and the new economic environment, people
                must be able to develop their potential. That is why this is
                such an important issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with Mervyn Carrick about not simply
                talking about degree education. Further education must develop
                to meet the needs of the new society we are creating. There is a
                danger of creating an elite in education because impossible
                impediments are being placed on low-income families.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another issue that needs to be addressed is
                that students have been working part-time, not necessarily just
                since the introduction of fees. When I was at university, I
                worked part-time. However, there is now a greater onus on young
                people to take part-time jobs, sometimes working very unsocial
                hours. This often deprives them of time to study for the courses
                they are following. The Assembly should also consider the sorts
                of jobs they are taking. They are low-paid jobs, which enables
                many employers to employ people at very low wages.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Colleague, Eileen Bell, has often referred
                to the Cubie Report, which should be studied closely by the
                Minister and his Department. It is not a free handout. It has
                its implications. Cubie concluded</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;We are not persuaded that a principle
                of free education should apply in all circumstances. Indeed,
                fairness suggests that those who gain from higher education
                should make an appropriate and timely contribution in respect of
                the benefits gained.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is why the Scottish Parliament abolished
                tuition fees and instituted a graduate endowment. Fees are
                collected from graduates once they earn over £25,000. It is not
                a handout altogether.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While I welcomed the Minister’s
                announcement before Christmas, he did not go far enough. He has
                restored maintenance grants to students from low-income
                families, but much more can be done. Those from the poorest
                sections of society must be helped; and that is acknowledged by
                everyone here today. However, Cubie and his committee found that
                up-front tuition fees and the loan structure work against access
                for those very people who also have a traditional aversion to
                debt. The system dissuades them from even considering further
                education. We do too little to help those from lower and middle-
                income groups, while not demanding enough from those in the
                highest income groups.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Furthermore, we should bear in mind all the
                other costs that are involved with being a student. Those from
                rural areas have high transport cost or have to pay for rented
                accommodation, which is sometimes of a very low standard. Is
                this the sort of environment that we want for our students here?
                Scotland has taken the lead and has shown that it can afford it.
                This Assembly can afford it as well.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Huge gaps still exist in the postgraduate
                provision and the funding for mature students. The Minister
                appreciates the importance of this sector, given the university
                environment that he comes from. Career development loans are
                available to students from Northern Ireland who are doing
                certain courses in Great Britain, but such loans are not
                available to those studying here. How can we defend that?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must move away from loans to finance
                higher education to a system more closely linked to the income
                of students. We must expand provision for postgraduate students,
                mature students, part-time students and those from
                non-traditional student backgrounds. This must be done
                imaginatively, not by simply allowing more students to acquire
                larger debts. The present system here benefits few, other than
                the banks. I am pleased that Mr John Kelly has raised this
                issue, and Alliance will be supporting the motion.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms McWilliams:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, I will reiterate the type of financial
                package recommended by the Committee for Higher and Further
                Education, Training and Employment Committee. Over many weeks,
                it carried out research based on the Cubie model and
                international comparisons. One of the key issues in the
                discussion was tuition fees. It was pleasing to note that the
                Minister’s report said that there will be a 2% increase in the
                number of people who do not have to pay fees here. Given the
                lower income levels in Northern Ireland, this will improve the
                situation. Approximately 50% of students are exempt from tuition
                fees compared to about 45% elsewhere. Nonetheless, it is of
                major concern that 50% of students are still excluded.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no point in referring to the 1960s;
                let us simply refer to the 1990s. Today, 50% of students are
                paying fees. They did not have to do so earlier in the 1990s,
                and this is contributing to the problem of student debt. We
                tackled this issue, and the Minister was critical of the
                recommendations, because they would not have helped students
                from Northern Ireland who are living in Scotland or elsewhere. I
                reiterate the point that at the British-Irish Council there is
                an attempt to convince the devolved regions to make changes that
                will apply to students throughout the devolved regions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let us make this a priority for any future
                education agenda. Let us not have entirely different
                recommendations for England, Wales, Scotland and Northern
                Ireland. If the system remains as it is, students will face
                complications, no matter where they go. One of the major
                problems with the system is that it has become more complex, not
                less so, despite our attempts to simplify it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Part of the problem of debt is the amount of
                information that a student has to take on board. As Mr Neeson
                pointed out, increasingly parents have children attending
                different universities in different countries under different
                systems. There is an increasing problem of debt, depending on
                where a student is based. That is why we also recommended a
                one-stop advice shop.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Taxation consultants have shown how out of
                date the Inland Revenue recommendations are — they go back to
                before 1997, before tuition fees were introduced. The
                consultants recommend that urgent action be taken to update that
                information. That will involve action by the Minister and action
                in the areas of social security and taxation. We need to
                co-ordinate these systems.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.00 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report states that millions and millions
                of pounds are left over because, in certain circumstances, money
                has not been paid back to students. Students who moved from
                full-time to part-time employment or to summer employment, who
                did not know that they should not have been paying tax in the
                first place, or whose PAYE contributions were not paid back to
                them after they were forced to pay them, have all lost out
                through the tax system. That has increased the complexity of
                this problem.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Then there is the social security system. I
                note that the authors of the recent report of the Social
                Security Advisory Committee to the Government share our
                disappointment that their recommendations have not been adopted.
                Those recommendations focus on intercalated students who move
                from full-time to part-time study; on those who may be entitled
                to jobseeker’s allowance and some form of income support; and
                on single parents who have children over 16. Having stipulated
                the parts of the system that let students down, they recommend
                introducing regulations to deal with the problem.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Time and time again the Committee has to deal
                with the regulations, because the legislation is so complex and
                did not get them right at the start. The legislation can never
                be right, because the situation is ever-changing. We constantly
                have to pass regulations to deal with anomalies and ambiguities
                in the legislation. Indeed, within less than a year we have had
                to pass a number of regulations to deal with students who have
                fallen through the gaps. Also, the NUS/USI has asked us not to
                pass one regulation that relates to social security because it
                would simply worsen student debt.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a representative for South Belfast, where
                most students live, I am absolutely appalled at their living
                conditions in this new century. Anyone who pays us a visit will
                also note that while two children died awful deaths by fire on
                Sunday morning, so too did a student last year who was living in
                such poor accommodation, with such poor furniture, that the fire
                spread very quickly and death occurred.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Until we give students a reasonable income,
                landlords will have no reason to improve their properties.
                Appalling rents make for appalling standards in which students
                have to live, and this affects the whole community. I can bear
                witness to the deterioration of the university community in
                recent years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also want a response on the childcare
                issue. The Minister made proposals about childcare allowances,
                but he did not give us any details. This issue faces many
                students who are parents — they have to pay large sums of
                money to have their children taken care of, and they cannot
                afford to do so.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, I would like an equality impact
                statement on the decision that only those in key skill areas
                will get particular privilege. Many of those areas do not cross
                the gender barrier. I would be very concerned about humanities
                and arts in academic institutions if we concentrate exemptions
                on hard subjects only.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Byrne:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am grateful to all who have contributed to
                the debate. I want to support the motion and reiterate that this
                is a big problem for many students, whether studying at home, in
                Britain or in the Republic.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many contributors have referred to the fact
                that student debt has been increasing for years. I contend that
                over the last 10&nbsp;years that increase has been significant.
                Within the last four to five&nbsp;years, we have seen a
                particularly sharp rise because of the up-front tuition fees.
                Over the last three to four&nbsp;years, the mandatory
                maintenance awards have been abolished and the discretionary
                awards substantially cut.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, I welcome the Minister’s
                commitment to tackling the problem. The package of measures that
                he announced on 15&nbsp;December was a good attempt to address
                many of the issues. The greatest problem has been limited
                finance. I have lectured in further education for 20 years and
                have encouraged many people to go on to higher education. I
                would like to see more resources being directed towards student
                support. However, that budget is finite. Fewer people will be
                paying fees, which I welcome, but I would like to see no
                students paying any fees for any further or higher education
                course.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Student accommodation is a big problem in
                places such as south Belfast, Jordanstown and Derry. I agree
                with other Members that students are living in absolutely
                atrocious conditions and paying very high rents. The health and
                safety of some of their houses is also an issue. I would like to
                see some form of social housing for students with
                minimum-quality standards and co-ordination between the
                Department of Higher and Further Education, Training and
                Employment and the Department for Social Development. Parents
                and students would like to see that too. Queen’s University
                has student houses, but only a limited number. Many landlords
                are ripping students off, and that is adding to their hardship.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Students are dropping out of higher education
                courses because of their worries over debt. I take phone calls
                from students at universities in Britain about their hardship. I
                encouraged those students to go to Britain. They could not get
                into university here because of the higher entrance
                qualifications.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That leads to my second point. I welcome the
                Minister’s commitment to increasing the number of higher
                education places here, but there must be an even greater
                commitment to providing even more. I would also ask that these
                places be not concentrated in Belfast and Derry alone. If fewer
                maintenance grants are to be made available to students, we must
                provide higher education places for them closer to where they
                live. More further education colleges should be asked to provide
                higher education courses throughout Northern Ireland rather than
                confining them to a few centres alone.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As parents, we all know the pain that some
                students endure, and many families are faced with debt. I know
                parents who have two or three children at university, and
                providing for them is a major problem. It is even more difficult
                if the students come from an area where there is very little
                employment and they cannot get summer jobs. An added burden is
                that they cannot register for social security benefits. Where a
                student genuinely cannot get a summer or part-time job, it is
                unjust that he cannot register for social security benefits.
                Surely in the twenty- first century we should be caring enough
                to allow such students to be given some money. This adds to
                family problems and burdens parents who cannot provide for their
                student son or daughter. It is a terrible dilemma for them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Lastly, I fully support the motion and hope
                that over the next year or two the Assembly can address some of
                its main concerns, particularly the misery that is visited on
                students and families in debt. The Minister was sensitive when
                he initiated his package of 15 December 2000, a package that was
                skewed towards lower-income families and in which TSN factors
                were addressed.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Hay:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is not the first time I have tried to
                tackle student finance and poverty. For months, finding a
                solution to this problem has been uppermost in the minds of
                members of the Committee for Higher and Further Education,
                Training and Employment. The House will agree that high cost and
                a fear of debt deters people of all ages from entering higher
                education.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many families struggle to pay fees and meet
                living costs, and for mature students with dependants there can
                be a benefits trap. Over the last five to 10 years, means-tested
                grants and student loans, for full-time undergraduates in
                particular, together with the removal of social security
                benefits, have added to student debt. In fact, 60% of students
                here now work part-time, some for 17 to 20 hours a week. We can
                tell from those figures that their studies must be affected.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">University figures show that 87% of students
                face financial hardship of some kind. That is a serious
                indictment of us as public representatives and parents, and we
                must try to resolve the problems. However, if we are serious
                about addressing them, we must look at what is required in
                third-level education and target the most disadvantaged
                students. Student debt trebled between 1995-96 and 1998-99, and
                hardship is widespread across both communities. Neither loses
                out when it comes to this.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Education is a right. I never want to see a
                day when it becomes a privilege. That would be totally wrong.
                More research needs to be done to determine exactly how many
                students are dropping out of courses for financial reasons. A
                funding scheme that provides students with enough money to live
                on while they study, without their needing to incur additional
                debt, is also required.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some students are going to financial
                institutions to try to obtain money, but some are going to loan
                sharks. As public representatives, we have a moral duty to
                address this problem, but it will not be easy. We are looking at
                many years of rising to the challenge and at many years during
                which successive British Governments did not deal with student
                finance and poverty. This matter will be raised in the House in
                the coming months and years. It is uppermost in the minds of
                those in the Committee for Higher and Further Education,
                Training and Employment. Although the Committee has produced a
                report that is useful not only to ourselves but to the Minister
                as well, we will revisit the issue in the future.</p>

                welcome the opportunity to address the Assembly. I also welcome
                the opportunity to take part in this debate on student debt,
                coming from an area that has high unemployment and where student
                numbers are increasing in Magee College and the colleges of
                further and higher education. This issue affects both
                communities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Various surveys have been carried out
                recently, but the one with which we are all familiar is the
                student income survey which was published in the ‘Financial
                Times’ on 21&nbsp;December&nbsp;2000. It said</p>

                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Government have insisted that the
                abolition of grants and the introduction of means-tested tuition
                fees have not deterred the disadvantaged from further education.
                The report, which examined the period 1998-99, was commissioned
                by the Department for Education and Employment. The president of
                the National Union of Students said that the student expenditure

                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;damning indictment of the Government’s

                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;likely to use evidence of debt to
                justify a new bursaries and scholarships system.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report found that at the end of 1999, the
                debt of a full-time student was £2473; £777 more than three
                years before. For a lone parent, the figure was £4747. This is
                how students are suffering.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister’s announcement of an extra
                £65 million to overhaul student finance was warmly welcomed,
                particularly in key skill areas, which, traditionally, have been
                the poor relations of education. This represents a significant
                switch of emphasis towards funding education for selective
                economic development rather than the traditional broad academic
                approach. This is welcome, given the Minister’s intention to
                increase higher education places again in 2002-03. It targets
                those most in need, promotes social inclusion and gives greater
                access to disadvantaged and under-represented groups.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The raising of the student fee contribution
                threshold from £17,800 to £20,000 means that nearly three out
                of five students in higher education will not pay any fees. A
                further fifth will pay only partial fees. The further
                introduction of means-tested access bursaries will help those
                most in need. Considerable investment is now being made in
                third-level students, and the Minister has made it clear that
                last month’s package is only a start. He is committed to
                improving the position of students further as resources permit.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have listened to the debate with
                considerable interest and have no difficulty in supporting the
                motion. Members know that the issue is of deep concern and
                interest to me. I have devoted much time to addressing the
                matter as effectively and fairly as possible. I have approached
                the issue bearing in mind the twin social principles of the Good
                Friday Agreement — targeting social need and equality of
                opportunity in further and higher education, training and
                employment, for which I am responsible.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On 15 December 2000 I outlined to the
                Assembly Committee my proposals for changes to the student
                support arrangements, and followed this up with a public
                announcement. I hope that I left Committee members, Assembly
                Members and the public in no doubt of my determination to
                address student financial support in as positive and
                comprehensive a way possible in our present circumstances.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The package I announced will give more than
                £60 million to student financial support over the next three
                years above that which is currently provided. I acknowledge the
                positive comments that many Members, if not most, have made,
                notwithstanding the fact that many would like me to have gone
                further. I wanted to go much further, but we do work with
                limited resources.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On 18 December 2000 my Colleague, the
                Minister of Finance and Personnel, reinforced my announcement in
                his Budget speech. He made it clear that my proposals have the
                full support of my Executive Colleagues. He said that funding
                was being provided through additions to my budget for 2001-02
                and through Executive programme funds for future years. Details
                of the proposals are subject to further evaluation by the
                Department of Finance and Personnel and others, notably the
                Equality Commission, before a final announcement can be made. I
                indicated that to the Committee, and the Minister of Finance and
                Personnel did likewise in his Budget statement</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that the Committee will take time to
                deliberate on my proposals and discuss them with me — I was
                invited by the Chairperson to return to the Committee and have
                agreed to do so — before coming to the Assembly with its
                considered response. Today’s debate, to which many members of
                the Committee have contributed, is not the end of the matter,
                though the broad direction of my proposals is clear.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My proposals have been fully endorsed by the
                Executive. They address the need to target additional support to
                those who need it most, which many Members have emphasised. The
                Committee, while still concerned about my intention on fees, has
                welcomed many of these proposals, and many are in line with the
                recommendations in the Committee’s report.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The further evaluation of my proposals is now
                under way, and I hope very soon to set out the details for
                consultation under the Department’s equality scheme. Reference
                was made to the need to demonstrate how the proposals meet
                equality requirements. I will be only too pleased to do so. As
                Members of the Assembly, and in particular members of the
                Committee, know, the Equality Commission itself has to cast its
                rigorous eye over the proposals before they are finally
                endorsed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I now want to address the substance of the
                issues before us this afternoon. I recognised on taking office
                that student support arrangements were in need of review, and
                initiating that review was among the first public commitments I
                made. If I recall correctly, I did so within two weeks of taking
                office.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was not an issue on which I needed
                prompting to decide that action was needed. It has been a
                priority for me and will continue to be. Some, not in this
                Chamber and not always in Northern Ireland, have argued that
                against a rising level of student participation in higher
                education — an increase which this year was at 5% over the
                preceding year — there was no need to look at this matter. I
                rejected that argument. My direct knowledge of the situation and
                my reading of the reports on the matter made it clear to me that
                there was an urgent need to address the question.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr J Kelly chose student debt as a
                centrepiece for the debate, and in so doing he reinforced two
                key aspects of my proposals. First, living costs is the really
                important issue for students in higher and further education. It
                is important in addressing that to look at the needs of the most
                disadvantaged, those on lowest incomes or those whose parents or
                those supporting them have lower incomes than average.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My proposals directly address those two
                important issues. However, loans have made an important
                contribution to student support since 1990 when the major
                expansion of higher education was in full swing, and they are
                likely to continue to be a vital element in student support for
                many years. The Executive, like the Executive in Scotland and
                the London Government, could not afford a support system without
                a loans element. Indeed, the Assembly Committee itself has
                endorsed a loan system as a key feature of its proposals for the
                future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If implemented, the Committee’s proposals
                would increase rather than reduce the debt faced by graduates.
                Through the recommendation that graduates repay the student fee
                contribution as well as any loan obligations they have incurred
                during the course of their studies, virtually all graduates
                would face a greater repayment requirement than at present. This
                requirement would also be greater than that which will pertain
                under the proposals I have announced. Under the Committee’s
                recommendations, even students who are presently exempt from a
                fee contribution would have to contribute to the graduate
                endowment fund. Let us remember that the existing loan system is
                highly subsidised by taxpayers.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.30 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Student loans represent an investment of £90
                million a year. In present circumstances the Executive could not
                afford to change this without severely damaging other services
                such as health, transport and school education. As Members who
                are calling for the abolition of the loans also supported the
                Budget proposals passed here several weeks ago, perhaps they
                would tell me and the Executive where the additional funding
                should come from. If it should come from my Department’s
                budget, I need to be told which services to curtail — services
                to the unemployed, university places, research, training
                programmes or what? We must recognise the constraints within
                which we operate. Indeed, outside my Department, what other
                services might be affected by the need to find funds on such a
                substantial scale?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Furthermore, it is important to appreciate
                that the current loans offer a reasonable deal to students.
                Loans are not repaid until a graduate is in employment and
                earning a minimum of £10,000 per year. They are repaid at a
                zero rate of interest, and annually no more than 9% of income is
                taken in repayment. Some 75% of students now take out a loan,
                and the average amount is £3,200. I remind Members that the
                private rate of return to those with a degree is 20% above those
                without a degree. That figure is widely acknowledged in research
                literature on this issue. Sir Ron Dearing, Mr Andrew Cubie and
                many other commentators in education agree — and the Committee
                itself accepts the principle — that those who benefit most
                from higher education should contribute to their living costs
                while studying.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Abolishing Government supported provision for
                student loans, as some suggest, would not be a progressive move.
                In their absence, students would undoubtedly have recourse to
                loans from commercial institutions on much less favourable terms
                than those available from the Student Loans Company. In such
                circumstances, student debt would be considerably increased
                instead of reduced.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The review has been a complex exercise with a
                competing range of approaches to explore and evaluate. In the
                past, policy was to maintain parity with England and Wales, but
                the review also had to consider the Cubie Report and the
                Scottish Executive’s response. Further changes are underway in
                England and are also likely in Wales.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The review focused on several broad
                objectives. I will briefly outline the main provisions on higher
                education, the subject of today’s motion. Raising the
                contribution threshold from £17,000 to £20,000 means that over
                50% of students will not contribute to fees, while a further 20%
                will contribute only partially. Fewer than 30% will make the
                full contribution, which is just over £1,000 a year.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Mr Speaker in the Chair)</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A childcare grant to assist mature students
                on low incomes will be introduced. Means-tested bursaries and
                other access measures to widen access to full-time higher
                education to those from lower socio-economic groups will also be
                introduced. The minimum loan available to students whose parents
                or spouses have residual incomes of over £46,000 a year will be
                constrained to enable resources to be redirected and targeted on
                assistance for students from lower-income families.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope to introduce learning accounts for
                certain part-time courses to encourage lifelong learning and
                greater participation in part-time vocational higher education.
                The introduction of such accounts may meet the concerns
                expressed by one of the contributors about the absence of career
                development loans.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">More domestic places from 2002-03 will be
                provided, and they will, in part, be used to increase
                participation from lower socio-economic groups and address
                skills shortages. The Educational Guidance Service for Adults
                will be asked to provide a service to mature higher education
                students in co-operation with their representatives, and my
                officials will work with the education and library boards and
                student representatives to develop material for advising
                potential students on finance.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Madam Deputy Speaker — Mr Speaker, sorry. I
                did not notice that you had slipped into the Chamber.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker, perhaps you did not hear, though
                I trust that others did, the rationale, in so far as I could
                offer it in the short time available to me, of my proposals and
                their general direction and content.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today’s debate has helped to maintain a
                considerable level of interest in this issue, on which there is
                wide concern. My proposals mark a beginning and show that our
                devolved institutions can, and will, make a difference. I trust,
                as we take this debate forward in the Committee and the
                Assembly, and with representatives of educational institutions
                and students, that we will through that dialogue ensure that we
                maximise the level of support, and make it as efficient,
                effective, fair and equitable as possible to all who want to
                involve themselves in further and higher education at whatever
                level.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr J Kelly:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Cheann Comhairle, in moving this motion I
                was driven by the notion that we, elected Members, have an
                obligation to address issues that are critical to the citizens
                who elected us. Health and education are two critical issues in
                our emerging democracy, and it is difficult to distinguish
                between them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am delighted that the Minister attended,
                but somewhat disappointed by his unwillingness to address many
                issues that were raised by Members. In many ways he
                misrepresented the Committee. At the core of our report, agreed
                across the Committee, is the notion of, and belief in, the
                abolition of student fees and the concept of an education system
                free from debt. Despite our differences, that was at the core of
                what the Committee for Higher and Further Education, Training
                and Employment wanted. The Committee may — and I am sure that
                it will — go into that issue with the Minister in greater
                detail.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall not delay proceedings; they have
                already been delayed today. I thank the members of the Committee
                who contributed to the debate, particularly the Chairperson and
                the Deputy Chairperson. It is important that Members use the
                Assembly for the reasons for which they were elected and discuss
                matters that affect those who elected them; if we have done that
                today, we have not wasted time.</p>

                Social Development to make greater provision for people
                presenting themselves as homeless during this time of the year
                and to outline his plans to deal with the increasing numbers of
                homeless people throughout the year.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am sure Members are aware that the Minister
                of Finance and Personnel, Mr Durkan, secured £30,000 to be
                administered by the Minister for Social Development, Mr Morrow,
                to help reduce the plight of the homeless over Christmas. I
                congratulate both Ministers on securing that funding and
                administering it so rapidly. That was not an act of tokenism; it
                was a recognition of a serious and pressing problem.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Throughout the festive period everyone speaks
                of the season of goodwill. By supporting the motion unanimously,
                we will continue that goodwill towards the homeless, and
                homelessness is a serious and growing problem. Despite the
                imaginative schemes and hard work done by a range of groups and
                voluntary bodies, despite good leadership and practice by the
                Housing Executive and despite additional funding, homelessness
                has risen by 17·6% in the past five years and continues to
                grow.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A cursory look at the urgent waiting list of
                the Housing Executive shows that about 11,000 families are
                waiting to be housed, and perhaps as many as 100,000 people are
                awaiting adequate accommodation. Those figures are based on
                details of officially registered homeless people, and an even
                greater number of people present themselves as homeless. There
                has been criticism that the standards for admission to the
                homeless lists are too severe. In addition, there is evidence
                that many other homeless people, especially young people, do not
                even present themselves. The application process is often cited
                as a hurdle.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must have controls to avoid abuses of the
                system, and there is well-documented evidence of abuse. However,
                if the controls are too strict and contribute to the escalating
                problem, the Department should re-examine the matter.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.45 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are several dimensions to the problem.
                First, there are those who are homeless, who are on the Housing
                Executive’s waiting list, and who have no family or friendship
                network of support. One of the worst growing aspects of this is
                the lone, or separated, parent with young children who has to be
                placed in bed-and- breakfast accommodation. In south Down the
                general practice is for such people to leave their premises
                after breakfast and walk the streets of the town until bedtime.
                The misery of such a situation is unacceptable. It is a problem
                for the Department for Social Development, and it could be
                ameliorated simply by more suitable housing and temporary
                accommodation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Homelessness among young people is another
                dimension to the problem. There are two main reasons. First,
                there can be a family breakdown or some form of abuse. Financial
                or serious internal conflict can drive a young person from the
                family home. Such young people are among the most vulnerable,
                and guidance is essential to help them avoid a pattern of living
                that becomes self- destructive. In value-for-money terms, a
                little spending now could mean future savings in health, law and
                order and other areas.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second area involves young people leaving
                care, and this compounds the homeless problem. There are several
                serious problems here. First, there is insufficient support and
                preparation for young people before they are cast adrift from
                care. Secondly, young people leave care a year before they are
                eligible for a Housing Executive tenancy or housing benefits.
                They are simply unable to get a tenancy. At that stage the
                Housing Executive requires a guarantor. Can you imagine how
                difficult that is for such a young person? Often, social
                services act — but not always. It is a situation of great
                concern.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition to the difficulties faced by
                these young people, coming out of care and trying to manage
                alone is a major challenge. It is difficult for those with no
                knowledge of the effects of institutionalisation to envisage the
                extent of that challenge. The problems range from personal
                hygiene to financial and tenancy management. Such young people
                should not have to cope on their own. This is where the problem
                crosses from the Department for Social Development to the
                Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety. The
                levels of support are very poor.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The situation is even more pronounced among
                those who have had mental or institutionalised disorders and who
                are now in the community as a result of the last Government’s
                community care policies. Community care is an excellent idea and
                is approved by practitioners at all levels. However, it is an
                expensive option, and attempts to introduce it on the cheap lead
                to disaster. Many of those so released are now among the most
                difficult homeless cases. Clearly, this is not just a social
                problem; there is a great need for health and social services to
                help housing specialists, who are, after all, only housing
                specialists. There are many examples of dedicated, hard- working
                social workers who are simply overwhelmed by the volume and
                complexity of their work, and I know many examples of breakdown,
                staff shortages and totally inadequate, and in some cases
                non-existent, funding.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am glad that Mr Morrow is here this
                afternoon, for he is the prime mover in this. I appeal to him to
                liaise with his Colleague in Health, Social Services and Public
                Safety no matter how difficult he may find that to ensure that
                there is a greater standard of support for people in these
                situations. However, even that will not deal with the whole
                problem. There are people with whom, for a wide variety of
                reasons, other agencies find it too challenging to deal. Some
                positive and substantial efforts have been made to ensure that
                some of their needs have been addressed, but not enough.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some of the Christmas funding went to help
                outreach projects offering the most basic support to those who
                are termed &quot;the roofless&quot;. We must ensure that these
                projects are getting the support they need, because the
                alternative is to leave people to die in the streets. This is
                what is happening. Some people may be shocked by these figures.
                Many can see the problem for themselves when they see people
                begging in Dublin. In London, the problem manifests itself in
                what are called &quot;cardboard cities&quot;, but here it is a
                hidden problem. Many bodies are working tirelessly to combat it,
                but people are still falling through a system that appears to be
                flawed. How else could the problem have escalated as it has?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is a particularly poignant time of year
                to address this issue. For those who were lucky enough to be
                with their families over Christmas and are now looking forward
                to starting the new year, it is easy to forget those who do not
                have the simplest of necessities, such as somewhere they can
                call home. After the right to life, the right to a home must be
                a very close second, and there is a huge amount to do to tackle
                this growing trend. We need to re-examine the application
                process and ensure that in an attempt to stop abuse, individuals
                are not being prevented from getting the service they need.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Suitable housing must be provided, and to
                prevent even more people from becoming homeless, more adequate
                temporary accommodation must be made available, and temporary
                accommodation must mean just that — a stopgap home, not an
                inadequate substitute.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need more support for young people leaving
                care, personal support and the ability to rent accommodation.
                Some very successful stepping-stone projects have been run in
                the past. They provided a home for young people in similar
                situations. It was the young peoples responsibility to take care
                of the home with some supervision, and that prepared them for
                living alone. A study some years ago showed that 35% of hostel
                dwellers were suffering from mental health problems, some of
                which ranged from middle to severe in degree. We need to examine
                the issue of community care, establish where it has been failing
                us and put it right.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I urge Members to support my call for
                adequate provision to be made to ensure that everyone has
                somewhere to live, surely a basic right. We made a start with
                the money at Christmas. We made a difference, but we can make an
                even greater difference. We must do better so that the blight of
                homelessness and the way in which that points to an uncaring
                society does not become the norm.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Shannon:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion moved by Mr ONeill on a
                matter that concerns most of us. When you live in an affluent
                society and in an area where you do not see people sleeping in
                the streets, you tend to think that there is not a problem.
                However, when you have an advice centre and are in touch with
                constituents, you see where the problems are. There are very
                clear problems with homelessness, and I am glad to have this
                opportunity to make some points to which the Minister may be
                able to respond.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is not just homelessness that is the
                issue, but the hopelessness of homelessness. It is people who
                have nowhere to go, no homes and no family. Those are the people
                we are trying to help, and this is our opportunity to do
                something. In the last couple of years, we have seen the impact
                of homelessness and the desperation of those who have nowhere to
                go and who may sleep in a cardboard box, on a park bench or in
                the open. However, when we try, as elected representatives, to
                get them accommodation, we find a problem with housing
                associations and the Housing Executive. Some who present
                themselves to the Housing Executive have nowhere to go. Most are
                single, many have health or addiction problems, many have no
                money and all are vulnerable and desperate for help. The one
                thing that has had an impact upon me is that desperation. We
                must focus on the problem and do something quickly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no age limit on homelessness. The
                homeless can be elderly, middle-aged or, more often, young. When
                they go to the Housing Executive to be pointed, many find that
                they have no points. The circumstances can be desperate. Often
                it is younger people, 16 to 17 year-olds and those up to 25, who
                have lived at home and fallen out with their parents who have
                nowhere to go. They are desperate and alone, with no one to
                help. A society should be judged by its attitude to people who
                are vulnerable. If we want a society that helps such people, we
                have to look at what we are doing as elected representatives.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some of those people do not meet the criteria
                needed for points for the housing list. We know what happens now
                — they have nowhere to go. Will the Minister say what steps
                his Department is going to take to enable such people to qualify
                for housing?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need to address the concerns of many and
                ensure that the homeless get accommodation. Adequate,
                satisfactory alternative accommodation must be offered to those
                in need. I have heard of such people being offered hostel
                accommodation, which has turned out to be &quot;hostile&quot;
                accommodation. They were moved to certain areas and had to move
                out because of intimidation.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">6.00 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If they cannot get hostel accommodation in
                their area, they are moved to places outside it, such as
                Downpatrick, Larne or Limavady. That is how far some people from
                the Ards and Strangford areas have had to go to get
                accommodation. They were moved right out and into areas where
                they did not feel happy. Already vulnerable and worried about
                what was happening, they found themselves in areas where,
                sometimes, their political viewpoints were at odds with those of
                the locals.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We want to look at the alternative
                accommodation that is offered. We have to ensure that people
                are, by and large, housed in hostels in their areas to ensure
                that they do not have these problems. I ask the Minister to look
                at that as well, because it seems, certainly in the area that I
                come from, that hostel accommodation is not always available and
                people find themselves in areas where they do not want to be.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also ask the Minister to respond on the
                problem of homeless people with young children. They move from
                school to school while their parents try to find accommodation.
                It is an unsettled time for the family and very unsettling for
                the children. It should be possible to provide accommodation
                within their areas or in areas where they intend to go to give
                consistency in their education. That is particularly worrying
                for parents and elected representatives, and I ask that that
                matter also be taken on board.</p>

                between all the Departments and bodies to address the
                homelessness problem. We have all received figures from the
                Simon Community showing a 5% decrease in the problem. Can the
                Minister confirm that this decrease in the past year will not
                lead to complacency and that he will ensure that the downward
                trend, if there is one, continues?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members receive a variety of information on a
                regular basis. Some is interesting, and some is serious, but
                this little brochure from the Simon Community really spells out
                what homelessness means. It states</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Our home is very important to all of
                us. It gives shelter and warmth. A home is somewhere that
                provides us with independence. It is somewhere where we can feel
                safe and secure. It gives us privacy when we want to be alone.
                It allows us to open the door to family and friends when we want
                to enjoy their company. Our home provides us with stability so
                that we can fulfil ourselves in work, hobbies and relationships.
                It gives us a place within our community and a sense of
                belonging. To be without a home is to be vulnerable both
                physically and emotionally … It is easy to think that people
                become homeless through their own fault or because they can not
                be bothered to put in the effort to change their situation.
                Listening to people who are homeless reveals quite a different
                story.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It goes on to give the heartbreaking stories
                of three different people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Homelessness blights many lives. It is right
                that this problem be highlighted in the Assembly and that we
                should attempt to mitigate its effects. I congratulate Mr ONeill
                for moving the motion. I am pleased to see the Minister for
                Social Development taking note of the sentiments being
                expressed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At one time it was fashionable for to speak
                of the &quot;deserving poor&quot; and the &quot;undeserving
                poor&quot;. I am glad that such attitudes are disappearing,
                though some parts of society still have a considerable way to
                go. In dealing with homelessness, we do not nowadays
                differentiate between those who have contributed to their
                situation and those who, through no fault of their own, have
                ended up with problems.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As we try to alleviate the problem and assist
                people to find a suitable home rather than leave them to live
                rough, we should pay tribute to the Housing Executive for the
                positive steps that it has taken to house those in categories A1
                and A2 with urgent needs. The Housing Executive is at the sharp
                end of the problem and, with a limited budget, can do only so
                much. A more proactive approach to the problem is needed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People find themselves without a home for
                different reasons. Young girls become pregnant, leave home and
                need accommodation in a hurry. Growing numbers of people from
                all age groups find life difficult and end up sleeping on the
                streets. The Simon Community brochure shows that 40% are
                homeless due to disputes with partners, families or friends; 10%
                of cases are due to eviction or failed tenancies; and 9% were
                intimidated out of their homes by others. Mr ONeill also
                referred to that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The figures speak for themselves. Some 10,997
                households presented as homeless to the Housing Executive. The
                Simon Community received 4,065 referrals from people seeking
                accommodation, of whom half were under 25, one quarter were
                female and one quarter had slept rough. Homelessness crosses the
                boundaries of age, class, gender and religion. There may also be
                problems with alcohol or drugs, or, perhaps a young person has
                outstayed his welcome at home and has been shown the door.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sheltered accommodation may be available for
                those with educational difficulties, and there are some
                excellent schemes. Voluntary agencies such as the Salvation Army
                and the Simon Community are to be congratulated on the difficult
                work they do. However, it is up to the Executive and the
                Assembly to provide the impetus to deal with this growing
                problem.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion is directed at the Minister for
                Social Development, which is appropriate. However, it is not
                just his Department that should be involved. The Minister of
                Health, Social Services and Public Safety should be involved
                too. She is responsible for health promotion and social
                services, which could help here. The Department of Education may
                also have a role to play. Many factors lead to homelessness, and
                some are connected to the education system, which should be more
                proactive in guiding the young on sexual issues and the misuse
                of drugs and alcohol. We do not need to follow Westminster and
                appoint a homelessness czar, but we urgently need a co-ordinated
                approach.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the Programme for Government, the
                Executive spoke of a healthy society and social inclusion. We
                must ensure that those fine sentiments are not simply pious
                words and lipservice. It will be a step in the right direction
                if we can alleviate the serious problem of homelessness.</p>

                constitutes homelessness, and how many people should be
                described as homeless, has run for years. Homelessness is a
                relative concept — it ranges from those who do not have a roof
                over their heads to those who live in insecure or poor,
                sub-standard accommodation in both urban and rural areas. The
                question of where on the continuum of housing need to demarcate
                &quot;homelessness&quot; is a political one, which is somewhat
                subjective.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The current response to homelessness by the
                statutory services is legislated for in the Housing (Northern
                Ireland) Order 1988. The Order makes the Housing Executive
                responsible for meeting the housing needs of homeless people as
                long as each person clears three hurdles — he must be
                perceived to be vulnerable; he must be in priority need; and he
                must not be intentionally homeless. In many cases, the Housing
                Executive places a homeless person in a hostel or temporary
                accommodation, where he remains until allocated a public-sector
                tenancy. The time for this allocation varies between areas,
                depending on the housing demand, and can range from 18 months to
                two years. The length of the waiting period can have serious
                health implications for the person caught in the homeless trap.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not want to repeat points made earlier,
                but I want the Assembly to address a number of proposals. I
                suggest that we allocate resources to increase public-sector
                housing and provide support for vulnerable public-sector
                tenants, so that their tenancies are maintained. We should also
                examine the high cost of rent in hostels and the length of time
                homeless persons remain there as well as promote the role of the
                private sector by supporting a percentage of those who are
                homeless with rent deposit schemes. We should also enhance the
                role of the private sector. It could meet the needs of those who
                are homeless but are not deemed to be priority cases by the
                Housing Executive. We should examine the reasons for people
                becoming homeless — in many instances a multitude of issues
                has affected an individual, resulting in homelessness. Education
                agencies have an important role to play in preventing this.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A strategic approach is needed to deal with
                the increasing number of homeless people who come to the Housing
                Executive each year. The lack of appropriate &quot;move-on&quot;
                accommodation is one of the major problems, as is the lack of
                support that would help homeless people keep their tenancies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The availability of public-sector housing
                needs to be examined, if we are to address the very serious
                problems. Homeless people must have rights that are guarded
                through legislation, and ad hoc or short-term programmes to meet
                particular needs should be made possible. We must be proactive
                on homelessness, and — and this was highlighted by Mr Davis
                — a holistic approach is needed towards the personal
                experiences of people caught in this trap. No room must be left
                for inactivity.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some people in Northern Ireland, maybe even
                in the Assembly, think that we do not have a problem with
                homelessness and that this motion is irrelevant, but I
                congratulate Mr ONeill for moving it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although there is no obvious evidence of
                people sleeping on the streets, or of cardboard cities as in
                Dublin or London, this does not mean that they do not. According
                to organisations that work with the homeless, if people have no
                accommodation, they end up in places such as cemeteries. This is
                happening throughout the Province, not just in Belfast, and it
                is something that should not be allowed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When legislation on this was eventually
                passed for Northern Ireland in 1988, coming into force on 1
                April 1989, it was based upon the Westminster Act that had been
                in force for many years. As a result, the Housing (NI) Order
                1988 benefited to a certain extent from lessons learned in
                England, Scotland and Wales over those 12 years, but for a
                variety of reasons it gave rise to considerable concern among
                housing experts. The most troubling of these was that, like the
                earlier Act, the Housing Order still ignored the single largest
                homeless group — single people, usually young single men.</p>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today Government figures show a 5% drop in
                homelessness during the last 12 months, while the Simon
                Community, which is faced with the single homeless, who are not
                recognised as such by the system, report a 4·7% increase during
                the same period. Lies, damned lies and statistics.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No one should be homeless, forced to sleep
                rough, sleep in hostels, occupy condemned premises or, worse
                still, cemeteries. It is alarming that 24% of some 4,000 people
                slept rough in the two weeks before they approached the Simon
                Community. People fleeing from intimidation or marital disputes
                further exacerbates the situation and helps to explain why they
                are not all seen lying on the streets.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must ensure that the problem is met
                head-on. We must help the Ministers of all Departments to
                achieve this aim. The £30,000 announced by Minister Durkan at
                Christmas was only the quick application of sticking plaster,
                and to be honest I do not think that anyone thought it was
                otherwise.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Consistent financing is essential, but we
                must provide proper accommodation and solve the other associated
                problems. We can continue to support the efforts of the Housing
                Executive, the Simon Community, Shelter (NI) Ltd, the Salvation
                Army and other organisations to alleviate homelessness.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The current figure of 10,997 homeless
                reported by the Housing Executive does not take into
                consideration the proportion of the people who approached the
                Simon Community. They are not included in the official figures.
                We must, as a supposedly caring society, face up to our
                responsibilities. A roof over one’s head is the most basic
                right, surpassing all human rights apart from the rights to life
                and food.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The young are suffering most given the
                numbers involved, and that is not surprising since the vast
                majority do not qualify for inclusion in homelessness
                statistics. Families must continue to get priority, but that
                does not justify ignoring the young and leaving them to
                voluntary organisations. They are human beings like we are with
                the same human rights, even if some of them have never had a
                job.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Programme for Government recognises the
                need for all Departments to work together with outside
                organisations to alleviate the problems of vulnerable people.
                Education, health and job provision are major factors in
                reducing the number of homeless. Joined-up government is the way
                forward, and we have acknowledged this many times. I hope that
                we will put our words into action.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion recognises that this problem does
                not, as Mr ONeill said, just exist at Christmas. It needs
                attention throughout the year. I will be interested to hear from
                the Minister if any plans have been drawn up for the Supporting
                People initiative, which his Department will be striving to put
                into action.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion and hope that the
                Ministers will do something about it.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Boyd:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Regrettably, homelessness is a growing
                problem, with nearly 12,000 households presenting as homeless to
                the Housing Executive annually. Homelessness is particularly
                poignant at Christmas, but it remains a serious problem
                throughout the year. Last year, as several Members have said,
                the charity that takes the lead in tackling homelessness here,
                the Simon Community, was approached by over 4,000 people for
                help. Only 1,100 were able to get accommodation. That
                represented a 4·7% increase on the previous year, so it is
                wrong to take the Housing Executive’s figure of a 5% decrease
                in isolation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The most frightening aspect is that the
                majority of the homeless, 54%, are aged 25 years or under, and
                almost one quarter reported sleeping rough for up to 14 days
                before, 23% of whom were female. There is great concern about
                the increasing number of homeless young people, particularly
                among 16- and 17-year-olds, and the growing number of teenage
                parents. About one in 10 of the teenagers living with the Simon
                Community are parents separated from their children, either
                voluntarily or against their wishes. This is horrific. In
                addition, a significant number of teenage women in Simon
                Community houses are pregnant. People can be without a home for
                many reasons including family conflict, physical violence,
                intimidation, relationship breakdown and financial difficulties,
                including the most vulnerable in society.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">People’s attitudes to homelessness must be
                changed. Many perceive the homeless to be middle-aged males with
                a drink problem, but any one of us could be without a home,
                given the wrong set of circumstances. Safe and affordable
                housing is a right. Research by the Simon Community shows that
                only 4% of the population have any accurate understanding of the
                facts of homelessness. To many in Northern Ireland it is a
                problem for London, Manchester and Dublin, but not for Belfast.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have a shortage of housing that is
                suitable and affordable for single people and small families
                seeking to establish themselves or re-establish themselves at
                the lower income level of the market.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The number of housing repossessions has
                increased dramatically in recent years. Housing has become an
                investment opportunity for individuals and companies seeking to
                make money. The concept of social housing as part of the
                necessary fabric of society has been predominantly lost.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The numbers sleeping rough are growing
                significantly. Homelessness is not confined to large cities.
                Research carried out by the Simon Community shows substantial
                homelessness in regional areas. Figures from the Simon Community
                and the Housing Executive show a large increase in the numbers
                looking for help in Newtownards, Banbridge, Newry, Ballymena,
                Antrim, Larne, Ballymoney, Coleraine, Londonderry, Magherafelt
                and Strabane. The most marked increases are in Newry, Ballymena,
                Antrim, Coleraine and Strabane. Is it possible to get out of the
                cycle of &quot;No job, no hope, no home&quot;?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Simon Community and other charities for
                the homeless help people build the skills necessary for coping
                with everyday life at home, such as cooking, managing finances
                and surviving on a low income. However, the proposed changes to
                housing benefit will have an adverse effect on these support
                services. The annual budget for the Simon Community in Northern
                Ireland is about £3·5 million. At present, rent from
                residents, which in the majority of cases is covered by housing
                benefit, makes up just under 50% of the Simon Community’s
                total income.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Housing benefit covers the upkeep of
                accommodation houses and the support services provided by its
                staff. However, the Government are introducing changes to
                housing benefit. In future, housing benefit will only cover the
                upkeep of accommodation houses. Support services will be covered
                by a new fund called Supporting People. The Simon Community will
                have to bid for this funding on a project-by-project basis, and
                it is concerned that the bids from all the agencies will exceed
                the funding available.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This poses a threat to a vital income source
                and will have adverse consequences for the accommodation and
                support services that the Simon Community and other homeless
                charities provide. I share the Simon Community’s grave
                concerns about this. This is even more worrying given the
                increase in the number of people seeking accommodation from the
                organisation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Homelessness is something that I feel
                particularly strongly about. During a visit to the Simon
                Community in Larne a few months ago, I was able to see the
                essential services that it provides for homeless people
                throughout the south and east Antrim areas — indeed,
                throughout Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Homelessness is a serious problem that needs
                to be addressed as a priority. There must be adequate investment
                to improve the housing stock, and particularly vacant
                properties. People are entitled to housing that fully meets
                their diverse needs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The shortage of suitable, affordable and
                accessible accommodation must be urgently addressed, and an
                overall improvement in the standard of social housing will have
                a positive impact on homelessness.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms McWilliams:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The homeless are not a homogeneous community.
                They can split into various groups. I want to focus on young
                people who have been at the centre of much of what we have been
                talking about.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are, of course, other important groups,
                such as older people who become homeless, lone parents, those
                with mental health problems, travellers, ex-prisoners and, more
                recently, sex offenders. Because they cannot find a house, they
                are vulnerable, being shifted from place to place. I will return
                to that later. I want to deal with the key issues, the reasons
                for homelessness among young people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the major problems is family conflict
                and breakdown — what happens when there is divorce or domestic
                violence or when a stepfather moves in and a young person cannot
                relate to him. There are major conflicts and, unfortunately,
                homelessness can be a consequence. Then we have physical, sexual
                and emotional abuse. Poverty and anti-social behaviour, with
                which we are familiar, are important. I am increasingly having
                to deal with situations in which young people and families are
                being moved out by paramilitaries, mainly at the point of a gun
                or at the end of a baseball bat, and into areas such as south
                Belfast, which is perceived to be mixed. We need an inter-agency
                community response to let these new residents know that they
                have responsibilities and rights.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A way should be found to reconcile the
                community with a group that is known as having been moved from
                elsewhere. That is at the core of what we are discussing. If we
                keep moving people from area to area, we increase homelessness.
                We must get to the root cause with the various agencies. Until
                the education welfare officer, the Housing Executive, juvenile
                liaison officers, probation officers and all relevant
                individuals are round a table together, we are simply dealing
                with poor residents trying to address each element of
                bureaucracy in isolation. People get fed up and say that they
                want the Housing Executive to move this family or individual out
                by next week — and round and round it goes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The situation is serious for young people
                leaving care. I was shocked to learn that within six months, 23%
                of such young people are homeless. The word &quot;care&quot; may
                not apply when we consider what happens to them once they move
                out of the residential accommodation age bracket.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recently, the Committee for Health, Social
                Services and Public Safety looked at this matter. Statistics
                tell us that family homelessness may be going down, but
                homelessness among young people is increasing. It is clear that
                over half the homeless are in the under-25 age bracket, and the
                Minister may want to look at the issue with regard to the
                selection of the age applying to the different groups. For
                people over 25, certain rules apply for benefits and selection
                for permanent housing. For people over 18 and under 25 different
                rules apply, and if they are between 16 and 18 the rules are
                different again. The system should be reviewed and the
                procedures for the different age brackets tied up. People should
                not be passed over just because they move from one age group to
                another.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am also concerned about legislative
                changes, and this is not an issue solely for the Minister for
                Social Development. We need an inter-agency approach to the New
                Deal. It is argued that elements of the New Deal initiative have
                indirectly created homelessness. A young person moving out of
                care may not be able or eligible to take up a gateway project.
                This person is also cut off from jobseeker’s allowance because
                he is not seen as a priority, and that creates homelessness,
                poverty and, no doubt, some anti-social behaviour. If people are
                cut off from a chance to earn money, burglaries will result.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have experience of working in refuges for
                people made homeless as a result of domestic violence, and one
                of the greatest initiatives has been second-stage housing —
                what is known as aftercare or &quot;move on&quot; accommodation.
                If refuges and hostels become a permanent solution for those
                fortunate enough to get a place in temporary accommodation,
                others needing such temporary help are blocked. A quick
                throughput of hostel and refuge accommodation should be a
                priority. Those seeking public-sector housing should immediately
                be given A1 status, and thus priority, and second-stage housing
                must be provided, so that people can move out quickly letting
                others in. We need to address that urgently.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Special health and social care support has
                already been mentioned by Members who referred to Simon
                Community projects. We need to give these projects core-funding.
                People should not have to rattle tin cans outside Woolworths. If
                the projects work and are good practice, let us fund them. They
                are run by voluntary organisations. The Simon Community has
                faced a deficit for three years in a row even though it has
                brought in most of its money itself. We must continue to support
                it. An inter-agency approach is required, because it takes more
                than a roof to tackle homelessness.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Tierney:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion and congratulate my
                Colleague, Mr ONeill, for moving it. I also congratulate the
                Minister for the additional funding of £30,000 over Christmas.
                Some Members have said that it will not make a dent in the
                problem, but the additional money is recognition that there is a
                problem.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My first speech to the House was on the
                Housing Executive’s budget, and a large part of it was devoted
                to the homeless. I pointed out the problems that the homeless
                face in my area. Suggestions have been made about how to tackle
                the different problems that different areas clearly have.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you present yourself as homeless to the
                Housing Executive in my area, a number of things happen. If you
                are a lone parent, for example, you will be put up in temporary
                accommodation, so long as it is available. In some cases
                accommodation is not available and people are asked to wait,
                sometimes for weeks. Homeless people get temporary
                accommodation, perhaps not immediately, but they are also told
                that they will be living in that accommodation for over a year,
                perhaps for a year and a half. People who are homeless in my
                area with no priority need — and this was touched on by Mr
                ONeill — are told that they will probably be housed in a
                couple of years’ time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms McWilliams rightly said that money is
                needed for new building so that people with priority get the
                houses they need. That would free up spaces for the homeless. A
                number of extra spaces have been made available in the Derry
                area, and I congratulate the Housing Executive and the voluntary
                agencies on that. However, it still has not reached the stage
                where somebody can present himself as homeless and be allocated
                temporary accommodation on the same day.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These individuals will have to wait until
                there is new building and people with priority needs can move
                out of temporary accommodation and let them move in. I heard
                somebody talking about figures on an annual basis, but you can
                produce figures on a daily basis. At least one person presents
                himself as homeless each day, only to find that nothing can be
                done for him, and that is disgraceful.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr ONeill touched on another valid point. An
                additional problem for those people who do not have priority
                needs is that if they are put into hostels, they slip out of the
                network of agencies that should be there for them. They are left
                to their own devices. Such people do their best to get out of
                hostels and into some kind of property, normally in the private
                sector, which they cannot afford.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Like most Members who have spoken, I agree
                with the proponent that a number of agencies must get involved,
                and if we are asking agencies to work with the homeless and
                solve the problem, our Ministers and Departments should be
                working together to try to solve it too.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am glad that the Minister is here. He has
                spoken to the Committee about this problem. He is concerned
                about it, as we all are. Most of the contributors to the debate
                have recognised that this is not a problem for the Minister for
                Social Development alone. On the contrary, a number of Ministers
                and Committees should get involved, and I urge them all to do
                just that.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr S Wilson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am going to obey the normal ruling and not
                repeat the plethora of points already made, most of which I
                agree with. I just want to deal with two aspects of homelessness
                that have not yet been mentioned.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that my first point will not be
                misinterpreted. We must be careful, as we discuss this matter,
                that we do not encourage the trend of people declaring
                themselves homeless. Many are homeless as a result of
                circumstances absolutely and totally beyond their control; we
                all sympathise with that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am sure every Member doing constituency
                work has come across the view that the easy way out of a
                difficult family situation is for the parents to throw the young
                person out, or for the young person to leave home. I have come
                across two such instances in the past couple of weeks. As a
                member of a party that emphasises the importance of families, I
                say that we must not devise policies that could make this seem
                an easy option for young people or their parents.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms McWilliams:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Member accept that most research
                carried out by the Council for the Homeless shows that the
                number making themselves intentionally homeless is minimal while
                the focus seems to be on the sort of exceptional cases to which
                he refers? As a result, attention is diverted from the core
                problem.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr S Wilson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I accept that the bulk of cases are as the
                Member says, and I emphasised that at the start of my speech. I
                recognise that the majority who present themselves as homeless
                are genuine cases and that they are homeless due to
                circumstances beyond their control. I stressed that I wanted to
                address issues that no other Member had addressed, so I said
                that policy should not encourage those who might believe that
                homelessness is an easy way out of a domestic situation that
                cannot be resolved.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is an obligation on public bodies to
                deal with this, and public money must be spent either through
                support to a number of organisations — and several have been
                mentioned — or through the provision of housing. Nevertheless,
                the vast majority of the homeless are young and single, people
                who by nature tend to be the more mobile members of society. We
                must also examine the provision of housing through the private
                sector, which might require less capital and could be an easier
                route to take.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This could be done in a number of ways, one
                of which has already been mentioned. Some people could secure
                private-sector housing if they could afford a deposit. The
                Minister should examine this. If the only impediment to securing
                alternative accommodation is a deposit, that should be made
                available.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another point, which is especially true in
                parts of Belfast where private landlords hold a large part of
                the housing stock, is that they, or the estate agents that look
                after properties for them, should have access to the homeless
                list, although care would need to be taken with data protection.
                They should be able to offer accommodation to homeless young
                people just as the Housing Executive and others do, and
                information on available housing offers should be made more
                accessible to them.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many other points that I wished to make have
                already been made, and I do not want to reiterate them. Those
                are two aspects that no Members had dealt with to date. I hope
                that they are not taken out of context, but they are pertinent
                to the debate and ought to be considered.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Lewsley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to
                the debate. Like many others, I want to look especially at the
                plight of the increasing number of homeless young people, for
                whom there is no adequate provision. Some are young, single
                people under 25, and some are children whose families are
                homeless.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recent figures from the Housing Executive
                show that in 1999-2000, 824 in the 16-18 age group and 1,690 in
                the 19-25 age group presented themselves as homeless. These
                figures give cause for concern but are only the tip of the
                iceberg. There are many young people who do not present
                themselves as homeless to the Housing Executive because there is
                little chance of getting any type of accommodation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have already heard that the Simon
                Community’s statistics show that 54% of people approaching it
                for emergency accommodation are aged 25 or under. Of the total
                number of referrals, almost 25% said that they had been sleeping
                rough in the two weeks prior to being referred.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is particular concern about the
                increase in homelessness among 16-to-17-year olds, and the most
                frequent reason given is family conflict, which has already been
                mentioned. These people are among our most vulnerable, and there
                is a high incidence of poverty, unemployment, sexual and
                physical abuse and family breakdown. Many were in care or prison
                before becoming homeless.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no specific agency for dealing with
                homeless young, single people and no statutory provision for
                accommodating those in the 16-19 age group. Their needs are not
                being considered when housing policy is being formulated, and I
                ask the Minister to take this into account from now on.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Only a limited number of places are available
                through organisations such as the Simon Community, and demand
                far outstrips that number. Many have to resort to the private
                rented sector, but that housing is often overpriced and of poor
                quality, which has a detrimental effect on their health and
                development.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Support services to enable such young people
                to develop and live independently are limited, and they
                frequently find themselves homeless again, unable to cope with
                their situation. Often they are underachievers educationally,
                and their housing conditions only serve to exacerbate the
                situation. Child poverty is a major issue. Last July, following
                the comprehensive spending review, Chancellor Gordon Brown said
                that the Government’s aim was to halve and then abolish child
                poverty. What, if any, initiatives does the Minister’s
                Department intend to take to address child poverty here?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have no mechanisms to provide decent
                accommodation for single young people, and one third of them and
                our children are living in poverty. We have the third- youngest
                population in the European Union, and our spending per capita on
                children’s services is significantly lower than in England.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many children experience family breakdown,
                poverty and homelessness at an early age, and there is a
                significant link between poverty, ill health and low educational
                achievement. We need a co-ordinated and concerted effort across
                all Departments to work alongside and utilise the skills and
                experience of organisations in the voluntary and community
                sectors and develop a strategy to deal with child poverty
                organisations such as like Save the Children, the National
                Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, Barnardos,
                Child Care NI and the Northern Ireland Anti-Poverty Network.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Young people deserve access to quality
                accommodation and support that will enable them to live
                independently, and they deserve access to training and
                employment. I hope that the children’s fund, together with
                more statutory provision, will help alleviate the situation in
                the short term and develop preventative solutions to the
                barriers that young people face to overcoming social
                disadvantage.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister for Social Development (Mr
                Morrow): </p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></b>I will do my best to address the points
                that have been made. If I fail to address them all due to time
                constraints or an oversight, I will deal with them in writing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Before I deal with the provisions of the
                motion, some points must be made to put homelessness in context.
                All Members sympathise with those who do not, for whatever
                reason, have safe, comfortable and regular accommodation. The
                Christmas and new year period brings into focus the differences
                between the homeless and those of us who can enjoy the comfort
                of our homes and the company of family and friends. I pay
                tribute to the many organisations that worked over the festive
                period to help the homeless with accommodation and the other
                comforts that the rest of us take for granted.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some Members, particularly Mr ONeill, rightly
                acknowledged the additional £30,000 that the Department of
                Finance and Personnel made available. That relatively small sum
                was welcomed by a number of organisations. I do not want to take
                undue credit. The money was supplied by the Department of
                Finance and Personnel, and my Department was happy to be the
                conduit for its delivery.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Homelessness can become a reality for people
                at any time, and I am concerned to ensure that the services
                provided by the statutory agencies and voluntary sector partners
                serve the homeless at the first point of need and on an ongoing
                basis. The Housing Executive has a statutory duty to ensure that
                accommodation is made available to those who present as homeless
                and meet the statutory criteria that they are homeless, in
                priority need and not homeless intentionally.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">About 45% of such households meet the
                criteria, so about 4,500 households are awarded full
                homelessness status in the common selection scheme, and around
                40%, approximately 4,500, of new tenancies are awarded to them.
                Not all those tenancies are of new properties, but those that
                are cost around £20 million a year. That represents significant
                resources going directly to homeless people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Housing Executive’s performance is such
                that 65% of homeless households are allocated secure tenancies
                within 12 weeks of being accepted as homeless, so they have
                faster access to social housing than most other groups on the
                social housing waiting list.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Housing Executive also supports the
                voluntary sector’s delivering accommodation and other services
                for the homeless. While that sector’s resources come primarily
                from the housing benefit system, the Housing Executive has been
                increasing its support, with £1·2 million budgeted for the
                current year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The sector is assisted to a lesser extent by
                health and social services boards and trusts, the Probation
                Board and charitable sources. Some Members mentioned the
                cross-cutting nature of the problem, and I assure them that the
                Department for Social Development is not the only Department
                involved in this.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Returning for a moment to the assessment
                process, if the Housing Executive has reason to believe that an
                applicant is homeless and in priority need, it is required to
                ensure that accommodation is made available pending enquiries.
                The term &quot;priority&nbsp;need&quot; includes people with
                families, young persons at risk of sexual or financial
                exploitation, single parents and other vulnerable people.
                Applicants assessed as meeting the statutory homelessness
                criteria and seeking social housing are added to the common
                waiting list and attract homelessness status in the common
                selection scheme for tenancies of Housing Executive and housing
                association properties. Where the Housing Executive is satisfied
                that an applicant became homeless intentionally but has a
                priority need, it is required to ensure that he is accommodated</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;for such a period as it considers will
                give the person a reasonable opportunity of securing
                accommodation&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those who do not meet the criteria are owed
                no duty by the Housing Executive and must make their own
                arrangements. The Housing Executive will continue to provide
                advice and direct individuals to other providers. It can accept
                applicants to the common waiting list, albeit with lower
                priority than might have been so.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion suggests that homelessness is
                increasing and will continue to do so. Since the mid-1990s there
                has been an increase in the numbers being accepted as meeting
                the statutory criteria for homelessness. More recent experience,
                however, shows that this number is no longer increasing. Rather
                it is remaining relatively constant.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members will not be surprised that in the
                current financial year intimidation is a significant cause of
                homelessness. Ms&nbsp;McWilliams touched on that. This can
                distort trends, and the current trend will not necessarily
                continue. However, under the current arrangements, any increase
                in the numbers accepted as homeless will mean an increase in the
                number of social-housing tenancies awarded to the homeless with
                a consequent decrease in allocations to other needy groups.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The motion asks about future plans to deal
                with homelessness. Members will appreciate that addressing this
                matter needs a partnership effort from the Housing Executive,
                housing associations and a variety of voluntary sector
                organisations. The availability of accommodation in the
                private-rented sector will also play a key part. I can report a
                number of developments on each of these fronts.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given that the Housing Executive has been
                addressing this problem for some 10&nbsp;years, it is timely to
                look afresh at how it might be dealt with in future. The Housing
                Executive is at an advanced stage with developing a strategy for
                a root-and-branch review of the homelessness problem and
                possible solutions. The review will examine, among other things,
                trends, programmes, services, gaps in provision and differences
                between urban and rural homelessness. It is anticipated that a
                document will be published by the spring of the coming financial
                year for the widest possible consultation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While the strategic review is under way, a
                number of ongoing plans and programmes deserve mention. The
                new-build programme delivered by housing associations addresses
                the permanent accommodation needs of homeless households and
                delivers temporary accommodation schemes identified by the
                Housing Executive. In addition, there are special schemes —
                for example, foyers, which link accommodation to the provision
                of training and job related services.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">7.00 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The private-rented sector is also recognized
                as a valuable source of temporary and permanent accommodation.
                The Housing Executive only uses private-rented accommodation on
                a temporary basis and as a last resort, particularly where the
                number and geographical dispersal of homeless households do not
                justify the provision of hostels.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, I wish to reassure Members about the
                standards of such properties. The Housing Executive does a
                rigorous assessment to ensure that specific criteria are met
                before letting them to the homeless.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members may be aware that the Housing
                Executive supports a number of rent guarantee schemes to enable
                homeless people to rent permanent, private-sector accommodation
                without having to pay the usual deposits. Other schemes of this
                nature are being considered for other parts of Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Lastly, the Housing Executive currently
                provides financial and personal support to a number of research
                projects being undertaken by groups such as the Simon Community
                to examine the underlying causes of homelessness as it affects
                various groups such as young people leaving care and families
                with young children. The results of this research will help to
                inform the planned strategic review. I am sure that we all
                commend the Housing Executive’s proactive approach in this
                regard.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Before closing, I want to turn again to the
                additional funding that was made available over Christmas. On
                that occasion, my Department and the Housing Executive, as I
                said earlier, merely acted as conduits to ensure that the
                £30,000 allocated by the Department of Finance and Personnel
                reached the agencies providing services to the homeless.
                Undoubtedly, this gesture will have raised expectations for the
                future, and it would be worthwhile examining if and how those
                expectations can be met.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Roles, responsibilities, authority and lines
                of communication have to be addressed, and my officials will
                discuss these matters with the Department of Finance and
                Personnel and others as appropriate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I trust that my comments have served to
                assure Members that I take homelessness very seriously. As with
                most other programmes, additional resources would allow an
                increase in types and levels of service. However, there are
                other important housing priorities that must be addressed,
                including unfitness, the needs of the disabled, the elderly,
                travellers and other vulnerable groups, energy, efficiency,
                conservation and fuel poverty. I will seek to ensure that
                resources to deal with homelessness are maximized where
                possible, given these other competing priorities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So that future policies, programmes and
                services for the homeless are as focused and effective as
                possible, and as a background to future funding decisions, I
                encourage Members to comment fully when the strategic review is
                launched, and I am absolutely confident that many Members will
                do just that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I now wish to turn to some of the specific
                issues raised, and one thread seemed to run right through most
                of the speeches made. Mr ONeill, Mr Shannon, Mr Boyd and Ms
                Lewsley voiced their concerns about homelessness among the
                young. I would like to deal with that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the 16-to-25 age group, around 2,500
                single people, male and female, presented themselves as homeless
                last year, 22% of the overall number. Current figures show that,
                by the end of October 2000, 1,226 young people had presented
                themselves as homeless, of whom 555 were accepted as such.
                Changes in society mean that younger people can be at greater
                risk of becoming homeless, and the review, which I have already
                mentioned, will address the needs and circumstances of younger
                people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It may be out of sequence, but Mr Shannon’s
                point follows from that. He asked about what happens to people
                who are not accepted as homeless by the Housing Executive.
                Pending its decisions on statutory homelessness, applicants are
                directed to a variety of temporary accommodation. The Housing
                Executive’s homeless advice service contacts appropriate
                voluntary accommodation providers and arranges referrals. A
                number of voluntary agencies cater specifically for young
                people, and the Simon Community deals with those under 18 years
                of age.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We normally, as a rule of thumb, give
                Ministers 10 minutes per hour of debate, which is about 15
                minutes in the context of a 90-minute debate. I know that
                Members want a response from the Minister, but I must encourage
                him to bring his remarks to a close.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Morrow:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker, you have been generous with my
                time allocation. There were many other questions that I wanted
                to answer, but I will finish with the point made by Mr ONeill
                about homeless people who have mental health problems. That is
                an important matter, and I would like to take one minute to deal
                with it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Housing Executive supported financially
                the research to which Mr ONeill referred. Subsequently, with
                health and social service trusts, it has been funding a support
                team to address mental illness among homeless people in Belfast
                hostels. The strategic review will consider if we need to expand
                that service.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr ONeill:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to thank all Members who participated
                for their very detailed speeches. It was good to see such
                tremendous support for the motion. It will not be necessary to
                comment on each speech, as that would only be to cover the same
                ground again. However, I particularly thank the Minister for
                what he said.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the news about the review into
                homelessness, and I am glad to hear that we may get a report in
                the spring. I look forward to that. I was making a point about
                the statistical side of the problem. There was a little doubt
                — and some Members referred to this — about the statistics
                and their meaning. I commented on those people who present
                themselves, and the Minister said that 45% of them are accepted.
                However, there is considerable criticism about the level of
                acceptance.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many people should be described as homeless
                but, for whatever reason, are not so accredited by the system.
                The problem is much worse than the statistics show. That
                explains why the statistics that I was using, and the statistics
                that some Members referred to, which came from voluntary bodies,
                showed a different trend to the one that the Minister described
                as having become static. That is all the more reason for this
                review to examine how efficient we are at looking at and
                quantifying the problem.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I know Sammy Wilson was not saying what he
                might be accused of saying when he talked about being careful in
                case some people regarded homelessness as an easy option. Monica
                McWilliams dealt with that well. I assure him that it is not an
                easy option to be on the streets or live in a cardboard box. I
                am sure that he knows that. He was preaching caution, and I
                accept his comment in that vein.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I said in my opening remarks, some control
                is needed because there has been evidence of abuse. As the
                Minister said, it can be a fast route to getting accommodation.
                Some unscrupulous people may attempt to use that and thus
                discredit deserving cases, but if the level of control is
                holding back genuine cases, that must be changed. I hope that
                the review, when completed, will give some hope to those people
                who I believe, as do many others, are missing out.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We could, as an Assembly, continue to knock
                on the Minister for Social Development’s door, which appears
                to be fairly open, to try to get more movement on this. Most
                Members talked about the need for cross-departmental work, and I
                am particularly anxious about a corporate approach to the
                problem.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">More too should be done for social care.
                While gathering information for today I went to Brunswick House
                in Belfast. It is a wet centre — perhaps the only one in
                Northern Ireland — that deals with very challenging people
                indeed, and I heard of a case that really shocked me. A
                handicapped woman in a wheelchair had been put out of a private
                nursing home. This person was not able to change her clothes or
                use the toilet on her own. She was on the streets of Belfast for
                two&nbsp;days and nights until people from Brunswick House
                discovered her and brought her to the attention of the social
                services. They then had tremendous trouble getting her looked
                after.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Whatever her personal problems are — and I
                am sure that they are difficult — what kind of society do we
                have in which something like that, an indictment of our system,
                can happen? That was proof to me that we are not doing nearly
                enough, and I hope that today marks the beginning of a new
                determination to tackle the problem. I would like to thank you,
                Mr Speaker, and all Members for their comments.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have had numerous debates about
                unemployment in a number of constituencies. However, I am trying
                to draw out the distinctive and unique effect that possible job
                losses that have been identified in West Belfast are likely to
                have on the constituency, more so perhaps than a similar or
                equivalent number of job losses would have in any other area.
                This was obvious recently in Fermanagh, the shipyard and other
                areas where impending job losses were quite rightly brought to
                the public’s attention, and people lobbied and campaigned to
                try to save them.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The uniqueness of the community sector, in
                West Belfast in particular, can have a double-whammy effect.
                There are around 900 jobs there, and that may make it the area’s
                most important employer. It is a double whammy because
                irrespective of how many of those 900 jobs are lost as a result
                of European Urban Regeneration gap funding or the new criteria
                stipulated for the peace money, for example, the Peace II
                initiative, almost all are in organising crèches, training or
                other employment initiatives. Most of those jobs themselves
                provide services.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Over the years many have talked about the
                good infrastructure in West Belfast. The area is renowned for
                its effective, vibrant and strong community sector. I pay
                tribute to those who have worked there and the people from the
                statutory bodies and other agencies who have worked with them
                trying to develop the cocktails of funding and create
                sustainable jobs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nevertheless, one of the successes of that
                infrastructure has been that it has, by default, masked the real
                difficulties of unemployment. West Belfast, like many other
                areas, has suffered infrastructure difficulties for years with
                employment, and I will not go into the legacy of discrimination.
                It is well documented that there has been no inward investment
                and few real jobs created in the area for years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Sir Reg Empey, who has been working
                with the local MP, among others, on establishing a taskforce to
                examine unemployment and how employment might be achieved. That
                is a worthwhile enterprise that he and other Ministers will be
                dealing with, and I look forward to a positive result from their
                work. However, this will not deal with the job losses that we
                expect soon or, specifically, with the fact that many of the
                jobs that will be lost help to provide much-needed services.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope to explore this issue with the
                Department for Social Development and, indeed, any other
                Department. I also hope to get a report commissioned on the
                impact of these job losses. They do not just affect individuals;
                they affect the local economy and the important services that
                they provide.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Good Friday Agreement promised new
                economic and urban redevelopment strategies. The Programme for
                Government detailed how the Departments will develop such
                strategies, particularly urban regeneration strategies. I will
                continue to monitor progress on this and seek the extra budgets
                that will make those promises realisable. The West Belfast area
                will face a difficult period soon, particularly with European
                Union gap funding whose new criteria will bring about the loss
                of many jobs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I appeal to the Minister for Social
                Development and his Colleagues to consider a report into the
                impact of these job losses on the West Belfast area. I am
                concerned about the number of individual jobs and the services
                they provide. Important infrastructure has been established over
                the years on which any future Government strategy could build.
                An impact assessment of this loss must be carried out.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to pay tribute to agencies working
                with the local people, and I refer not just to those in paid
                employment who provide a much-needed community service but to
                the many people, about 3,000, who, we are told, work on a
                voluntary basis. Most of the paid workers are on short-term
                contracts and low pay, and very often the posts are part-time.
                Most of the jobs are subject to renewal or are constantly under
                threat. Many of the organisations that employ these people spend
                much time trying to garner a cocktail of funding to keep their
                own projects alive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to put on record my appeal to the
                Minister for Social Development and his Colleagues for an impact
                assessment to be carried out. This is not only a loss of jobs
                themselves, it is also the loss of a whole array of much-needed
                services the West Belfast constituency.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Members who are here to take part in
                the debate and pay tribute to the workers in the west of the
                city who are highlighting the plight of their jobs and the
                plight of the valuable services they provide.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Attwood:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I acknowledge Alex Maskey’s tabling of this
                subject for debate on the Adjournment. It is timely to consider
                job losses in the community sector in West Belfast and to
                comment on that sector’s development in the past, at present
                and in the future. It is also important — and I am sure that
                all parties will agree on this — to acknowledge that all
                communities have been immensely resilient and resourceful over
                the past 30 years. While they do differ, we must acknowledge
                that that resilience and resourcefulness are shared and that
                they, not least in West Belfast, have been essential in ensuring
                that our civil conflict did not give rise to even more deeply
                damaging civil disorder. It is a reflection on the communities
                of which we speak that they have maintained those values in very
                adverse circumstances.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is also important to acknowledge that we
                talk about different levels of community development in
                different areas of West Belfast. Historically, the communities
                that Alex Maskey, Joe Hendron and I represent have had a higher
                level of development, perhaps because of church organisations,
                sports organisations and the need to organise to meet demands
                that the state did not meet. Conversely, the Unionist
                communities of West Belfast have, historically and to a degree,
                had a different level of development. Put rather simplistically,
                rightly or wrongly, the communities of the Shankill Road, the
                Woodvale Road and the Unionist areas of West Belfast believed
                that the state answered their needs. Partly as a consequence,
                they did not develop as communities in the way that Nationalist
                communities of West Belfast developed since partition, and
                particularly over the past 30 years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is unfortunate that Ian Paisley Jnr is not
                here. On the weekend after the 1994 IRA ceasefire, he and the
                political parties on the Shankill Road organised &quot;Shankill
                ’94&quot;. This gave expression to the fact that while there
                had not been such a high level of community development as on
                the Falls Road, the Shankill communities were organising
                themselves to make demands of the state about economic, social
                and cultural regeneration. That is developing on the Shankill
                Road in a healthy and creative way.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the community sector has developed in West
                Belfast there has been a loss in one respect, and that is the
                loss of volunteerism. Volunteerism has existed in Ireland for
                decades and generations and has to some degree been lost as a
                more professional community sector has developed. While that has
                brought about many gains, there have also been losses. It would
                be helpful and creative for communities if the tradition of
                volunteerism could be revived.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to put the motion in a broader
                context. One cannot talk about job losses in West Belfast
                without identifying the level of job opportunities or lack
                thereof. As it is, over 10% of unemployed people in Northern
                Ireland live in the constituency of West Belfast, and 17·5%
                live in North and West Belfast. Male unemployment in West
                Belfast is three times the average in Northern Ireland, and that
                is without touching upon the differential between Catholic and
                Protestant unemployment there.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While the most recent evidence shows some
                decline in unemployment in the Nationalist wards, it is in the
                Shankill wards that unemployment is beginning to increase. While
                Mr Maskey is right to say that there is a large concentration of
                community jobs in West Belfast, other jobs are needed to bring
                about regeneration and address the human trauma and tragedy that
                lie behind the figures I have given. With over 900 people, the
                community sector in West Belfast is one of the largest employers
                and should be judged and developed against demanding criteria.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first criterion that Mr&nbsp;Maskey
                mentioned is that valid projects are beginning to suffer from a
                lack of European peace money. Before Christmas the Minister of
                Finance and Personnel outlined proposals to deal with what he
                called &quot;gap funding&quot; — the period between the end of
                one phase of European funding and the commencement of another.
                That must be addressed immediately because valid projects
                throughout West Belfast need to be sustained quickly. I have
                been in correspondence with Sean Farren, not the Minister,
                Maurice Morrow, about some of them. I am sure that the Minister
                and his civil servants are scribbling mightily in order to rebut
                that point. The added value of those projects to education and
                training means that they need to be sustained as soon as
                possible.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, we need a strategy in West Belfast
                that is not saturation. There has been a danger in recent years
                of a saturation of community organisation that is not
                necessarily consistent with the best strategy for regenerating
                the area. That is in no way to demean or diminish the individual
                contributions of community groups, activists and leaders.
                However, rather than have a saturation of organisations, we need
                to have strategies to ensure that that large employer in West
                Belfast makes the maximum impact. We also need a strategy that
                is not self-serving. If we are calling for open, transparent and
                accountable Government, the standards we demand of the
                Government should be no less than those we demand of other
                agencies, including community sector employers. There is a
                sense, to a greater or lesser extent, that the community sector
                is not as open, transparent and accountable as it could be.
                Cases have given rise to a growing belief that the community
                sector should uphold the standards that are demanded of Members
                here and the Government. There should be open, transparent and
                accountable procedures to ensure that people are satisfied with
                what community organisations are doing.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">7.30 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thirdly, we need a strategy that sets the
                same standards for all communities, not least those in West
                Belfast. There is a sense that they look after the needs of
                their own rather than try to understand that the problems on
                either side of the peace walls in West Belfast are common
                problems, such as not having police officers living there, drug
                and alcohol abuse, child abuse, unemployment and bad housing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The liberation of West Belfast will come when
                a strategy is developed that transcends the peace walls and
                applies to all communities the standards that we expect for our
                own. Any strategy to target social need must target all social
                need. No one community, community representative or community
                sector should be heard above another. They must all be heard in
                the same way.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, the community sector is alive and
                well and bustling in parts of West Belfast and growing
                throughout West Belfast. It is vibrant and dynamic. It has a
                critical role in resources, leadership and its impact on the
                organisation and future development of a community. However,
                that work must be done in the context of the wider economic and
                social regeneration that Minister Empey is beginning to address.
                In that context, the issues raised by the motion will be fully
                and finally settled.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Ramsey:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, Mr Speaker. I thank Alex
                Maskey for bringing to our attention job losses in West Belfast
                as a whole. He did not specify whether he was talking about
                Nationalist areas or Unionist areas; only Alex Attwood did that.
                West Belfast includes Twinbrook and Poleglass, which I
                represent.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The job losses will have a negative impact on
                West Belfast and further afield. Alex Maskey pointed out that
                there will be other effects. None of us should be under any
                illusion about why community structures and groups were set up
                in areas such as West Belfast. They were set up because councils
                failed to deliver the services they were supposed to deliver for
                the communities they claimed to represent.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We all agree that community groups provide a
                valued service. They have played a big part in the lives of all
                communities and helped them grow by adopting a bottom-up
                approach and providing services designed by the people. The lack
                of mainstream funding has been hidden by European funding which
                is supposed to be additional but is not. It has replaced
                mainstream funding, and that is wrong.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We debated a motion on skill shortages
                earlier. Tomorrow the Committee for Health, Social Services and
                Public Safety will consider a report on teenage pregnancies and
                the need to educate young people to enable them to make better
                judgements. The report points out that rates of teenage
                parenthood are highest in areas of social deprivation and says
                that there is a need to target intervention on such areas,
                working in partnership with local communities. It also says that
                many community- based programmes receive only short-term funding
                and that if they are to be successful, they must be properly
                funded.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need to look at the greater impact job
                losses will have in West Belfast. As Mr&nbsp;Maskey said, not
                only is there an impact on a person who loses his job, but other
                areas suffer too. Crèche facilities will go, people will find
                it harder to return to work and after-school clubs will
                disappear, which will have a negative impact on the children.
                Women’s groups will no longer exist, while welfare advice,
                advice to the elderly and the homeless, whose problems were
                mentioned earlier, and youth provision will be things of the
                past. We need a joined-up approach. We can examine the Peace I
                and Peace II money.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister is here, and I appreciate his
                staying for this debate, as he sat through the last one. I thank
                him for that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As statistics show, the delay in Peace II
                money is forcing more job losses. Mr&nbsp;Maskey and Mr Attwood
                referred to these statistics. We need to lobby for mainstream
                funding for community groups, workers, projects and running
                costs. We should develop a proper wage structure to bring
                employees out of low-paid jobs. We must ensure that there is a
                real and active commitment to targeting social need and
                equality. As Mr Maskey said, we need a strategic approach to
                sustain the community sector, and we should show our
                appreciation to all there for their vision and commitment to
                creating change.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Hendron:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to thank Mr Maskey for
                initiating this important debate on the Adjournment. I also
                appreciate the presence of the Minister for Social Development.
                The Assembly, through the Executive and the Department for
                Social Development, must secure funding and develop a meaningful
                strategy for the voluntary and community sector in all areas of
                need though this debate is specifically about West Belfast,
                which includes a fair part of the Shankill territory as well as
                Nationalist West Belfast.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many of the problems started when the ACE
                scheme and community workshops were run down. Why is there a
                crisis in funding jobs? As has been said, it is because there is
                no effective strategy to account for the community sector. I
                agree with the West Belfast Economic Forum that the voluntary
                activity unit in the Department must say exactly what groups
                will be affected by the rationalisation measures.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many groups in West Belfast do not get
                mainstream funding from the Department for Social Development.
                The community sector should have a greater input into civic,
                political, social, cultural and economic matters. There is a
                major problem with gap funding, and bridging funding may be
                being applied selectively rather than liberally, although I
                hope, that that is not so. There is concern, and who will have
                the ability, integrity and authority to sort it out? I am not
                referring directly to the Minister.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the then MP for West Belfast I met with
                Baroness Denton when she was Minister of Economic Development. I
                told her that in West Belfast, LEDU, the IDB and Making Belfast
                Work were all doing work, as were community trusts like North
                and West and that young people were coming to the area to do
                doctoral theses. There were many activities but no
                co-ordination. Mr Maskey has asked the Minister to undertake an
                impact assessment of the job losses. Perhaps the answer lies
                there.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has been no co-ordination with jobs
                over the years, and that includes education, for a number of
                factors are involved. There is a large percentage of young
                people in West Belfast, so if you are talking about jobs you
                have to consider education. Whether they come from the Falls
                Road or the Shankill Road, five-year- olds starting school in
                that constituency are generally at a great disadvantage compared
                to children from more privileged homes or areas where people
                have good jobs. It is important to realise that a child’s IQ
                is not just inherited. Of course there are important genetic
                factors, but a child is also influenced by his home and
                environment from the moment he is born. Children in areas of
                social disadvantage are disadvantaged themselves by the age of
                five, and this has long term effects.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Much reference has been made to the many
                community efforts, and I will mention two in passing. Meánscoil
                Feirste almost went under because of the viability of numbers
                question. The community, the parents, the staff, Fergus O’Hare,
                the principal, and I were involved at the time. The then
                Minister, Michael Ancram, turned it down for funding, and it was
                the Secretary of State, Sir Patrick Mayhew, who eventually gave
                it some support. I can recall the massive battle fought by the
                community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Youth at Risk was another important community
                effort. Funding came from the Government and the European Union.
                I had some involvement because of my medical work. One could
                only be impressed by those people who were considered to be
                dropouts, young people who no one seemed to want and with very
                low esteem, sandwiched between the security forces and the
                paramilitaries. The results of the Youth at Risk programme were
                outstanding. I was emotionally moved when I met many of them
                later — once at a function in Andersonstown and on another
                occasion in the Markets area. The programme was stopped, but
                people like Jimmy Quinn played outstanding roles in it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Targeting social need is central to the
                Assembly, and I wonder if community and voluntary groups will
                have any part in developing proposals for implementing the
                interdepartmental strategy document. Additionality must underpin
                the relationship with EU funding bodies, and all dealing with EU
                funds must be transparent, open for public scrutiny and
                accountable to the European Commission.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I again congratulate Mr Maskey for bringing
                this subject to Assembly. My support for the principles is
                total, and I support his point about impact assessment. Perhaps
                the Minister will address that.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister for Social Development (Mr
                Morrow): </p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></b>I am aware of the contribution made by
                the voluntary and community sector in West Belfast and Northern
                Ireland generally. It provides valuable services and is a
                significant employer, with a workforce of about 25,000 across
                the Province. This is an important debate for West Belfast, but
                it is relevant to all of Northern Ireland, especially to areas
                of high social need, of which West Belfast is one.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I met with the Northern Ireland Council for
                Voluntary Action (NICVA) last week, and I have regular contact
                with a wide range of other voluntary and community groups, so I
                am aware of the real concerns in the sector about the impact of
                changing funding programmes.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">7.45 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Much funding for the sector is time limited,
                and we await final agreement on the outcome of the Peace II
                negotiations. European funding accounts for about one third of
                the total financial support for the voluntary and community
                sector in West Belfast, and I suspect that that level of
                dependence is similar in other parts of Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While economic renewal is likely to be a
                priority under the new programme, the detailed parameters of
                Peace II are not yet agreed. Since the new funding programmes
                are meant to be finalised, it may be premature to identify any
                specific impact the changes will have. However, priorities
                change, and there is no guarantee that projects funded under
                Peace I will be supported automatically under Peace II. The
                project managers know this, having been made aware of the
                time-limited nature of the programme when they applied for
                funding in the first instance.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are short-term difficulties and
                longer-term issues to be addressed too. Since it is taking
                longer than was envisaged to agree the mechanisms for disbursing
                Peace II and transitional Objective I programme funding, many
                valuable community projects face a gap between two funding
                programmes. My Department anticipated these difficulties and
                secured £4 million, in two tranches, to assist a wide range of
                projects and the people employed by them to continue their
                valuable work until the end of March 2001. This funding was
                shared with other Departments and funders to protect key
                projects.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The funding has benefited projects throughout
                Northern Ireland, including many in West Belfast. The Northern
                Ireland Voluntary Trust (NIVT) alone processed 29 applications
                from West Belfast for gap funding and provided almost £185,000
                to secure the continuity of 23 posts until the end of March.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The West Belfast team of the Belfast
                Regeneration Office (BRO) has tried to maintain the community
                infrastructure in West Belfast, as other BRO teams have done in
                other parts of the city. In discussions with applicants, they
                have said that they will focus support on key organisations and
                posts. By &quot;key&quot; I mean organisations that provide a
                co-ordinating or broad service, for instance local forums. Key
                posts are ones that are central to an operation, such as
                managers and co-ordinators.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is expected that these organisations will
                assist and support other groups that the BRO may not be able to
                support. I understand that this approach has been well received
                in West Belfast and that the BRO team has been able to meet, to
                varying degrees, the majority of requests made. The BRO teams in
                West Belfast and elsewhere have also met with other funders and
                statutory bodies to try to get them to provide support or match
                a contribution from a team, thus extending the funding period.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no complacency on our part about the
                problem. However, in the longer term the viability of many
                projects and the jobs they created will depend whether they
                become sustainable by generating their own income — a
                difficult, though not impossible, task. It will also depend on
                their ability to demonstrate their worth to funding bodies and
                to secure mainstream support for their activities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many groups have embarked on imaginative ways
                of generating finance through delivering services, sub-letting
                premises, amalgamation with other groups or restructuring. I
                welcome those moves. This proactive approach towards long-term
                sustainability by the voluntary and community sector will be a
                defining factor in the level of protection and development that
                can be achieved.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Despite this, there may well be further
                difficulties for some projects after the current gap funding
                initiatives end — from April 2001. I have asked my officials
                to review the situation urgently and consider what further
                action may be necessary. I am convinced of the need to provide
                continued support for the community and its infrastructure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let me say something about core
                infrastructure. The Department for Social Development is very
                aware of the importance of having an effective infrastructure to
                enable effective participation in addressing social need and
                social disadvantage. For the last round of gap funding we
                identified a number of criteria for eligibility for support. One
                was that an applicant group had a strategic role in relation to
                other groups, and another was the extent of the adverse impact
                on the community if a project ended. It seems to me that
                strategic support for the infrastructure is key and likely to
                inform our thinking on priorities for new EU funding under both
                the transitional Objective 1 and Peace II programmes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want briefly to identify my Department’s
                longer-term approach to supporting and developing the voluntary
                and community sector. We have focused on putting in place
                structures and funding strategies to help support the sector so
                that it remains strong, vibrant and able to help Government meet
                their objectives, particularly in areas of greatest social need.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department for Social Development’s
                actions will be driven by the need to ensure that when resources
                are scarce, they are targeted towards the right organisations in
                areas of greatest social need so that we achieve the best
                possible results. It is no secret that I have particular
                concerns about areas where the community infrastructure is weak.
                My Department consulted extensively on the Harbison Report,
                which examined the future funding of the voluntary and community
                sector. I cannot emphasis strongly enough the importance that
                the Department attaches to a more strategic and coherent
                approach to funding in the longer term. I expect to make an
                announcement shortly on the district councils’ community
                services programme following the Department’s review of that
                programme.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are also working to strengthen and cement
                relationships with the voluntary and community sector right
                across the Government and in Departments and agencies, and we
                will continue to conduct our discussions with the sector in an
                open and constructive manner and in a spirit of partnership
                through such important vehicles as the Joint Government
                Voluntary and Community Sector Forum.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Following consultation, and as agreed by the
                Executive when they endorsed the compact between the Government
                and the voluntary and community sector in February 2000, the
                Department is co-ordinating work on a new strategy that will
                encompass all aspects of government. The result will be a plan
                setting out actions that Departments will take over the next
                three years to support the sector.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are pragmatic and recognise that a
                substantial part of the sector’s contribution will continue to
                be through volunteering. We want to build lasting change by
                creating new volunteering opportunities, and not just where
                volunteering has traditionally been strong. NICVA says that
                there are over 79,000 volunteers, but despite this huge
                resource, some face barriers to volunteering that we want
                removed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Department is now implementing the Active
                Community Initiative action plan. Additional funds have been
                secured to enhance volunteering opportunities for those who wish
                to help shape their communities through voluntary action. It is
                designed to have an impact on areas of disadvantage.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In closing, the future of the voluntary and
                community sector must be a major concern for all. Its work has
                made, and will continue to make, a vibrant and dynamic
                contribution to society. Northern Ireland owes much to it, but
                we cannot duck the difficulties we face, and I do not want to
                minimise them. However, my Department is working hard to provide
                some protection.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All Departments must examine their budgets
                carefully to see if the programmes delivered through short-term
                funding can be sustained. The voluntary sector must examine
                options for rationalisation and collaboration to reduce costs
                and identify priorities. Shortly, the Joint Government Voluntary
                and Community Sector Forum, which my Department chairs jointly
                with the sector, will be working with the sector and the
                Government to see how these difficulties can be addressed and we
                can enable the sector to continue to make a dynamic contribution
                in West Belfast and Northern Ireland generally.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to address some of the other points
                raised during the debate if time is on my side.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Time is not on the Minister’s side, but
                those Members who have dutifully stayed on deserve some
                response. Perhaps the Minister will be as concise as possible.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Morrow:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A number of important points were raised by
                Members. Mr Speaker, I am at the mercy of your ruling. If I am
                not able to address such points, I will address them in writing
                to the Members concerned.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One very salient point was raised by Alex
                Attwood. It concerned the need for a strategy for the community
                and voluntary sector in West Belfast and elsewhere. Last year my
                Department, through its Voluntary Activity Unit (VAU), published
                the Harbison Report on funding.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That report contained important
                recommendations, which I will headline. A more strategic,
                co-ordinated approach to funding and the appointment of the
                Minister for Social Development to champion it were suggested.
                There was no lack of commitment from me or my Department. The
                integration of the VAU into an activity community unit was
                proposed, as were more information sharing between funders, the
                mapping of voluntary and community sector infrastructure, the
                establishment of a common database for funding, an integrated
                approach to development, the consolidation of delivery
                mechanisms, a task force to consider the diversification of
                funding and a clear definition of sustainability. It is an
                important report that I draw to Members’ attention.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sue Ramsey mentioned the failure of councils
                to support communities. I can confirm that that was reflected in
                the findings of the review of the district council communities
                that the Department published. Proposals will be brought forward
                shortly on the role of councils in this regard. I hope that
                these comments go some way towards reassuring people that we are
                neither complacent nor negligent of our duties, and we want to
                record our appreciation of the voluntary sector, an important
                part of society.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Hendron asked which groups would be
                affected by rationalisation. There is no planned process for
                rationalisation. We have to do all we can to protect the
                community sector. I understand that the motion specifically
                refers to West Belfast, but I am referring to the community as a
                whole.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker, you are looking at me, and I
                suspect that you are trying to tell me that my time is up. If I
                have missed any salient points, I will write to the individuals
                concerned.</p>
