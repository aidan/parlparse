    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill is an important step forward in dealing with  homelessness, and it aims to enhance and clarify housing law in a number of  ways. It is appropriate that I briefly highlight the Bill&rsquo;s key elements.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Some of the Bill&rsquo;s most important provisions deal with  homelessness and are commitments that I made in &lsquo;Including the Homeless&rsquo;, which  is a strategy for improving the social inclusion of homeless people. The Bill  ensures that tackling homelessness remains a top priority by placing a duty on  the Housing Executive to produce a homelessness strategy and on other  government agencies to take that strategy into account when delivering their  functions. The Bill also offers homeless applicants new rights of review and  appeal and makes the Housing Executive&rsquo;s procedures for dealing with  homelessness more transparent and accountable.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The provisions that relate to registered housing  associations will ensure that my Department can regulate those associations  sensibly and cost-effectively. If required, my Department will have the ability  to take early and appropriate action to safeguard the interests of tenants and  public funds. The Bill also improves existing law for dealing with antisocial  behaviour and provides social landlords with new tools to regain possession  more quickly of certain abandoned houses. The Bill&rsquo;s remaining provisions  improve the operation of existing housing law, strengthen the voice of local  government on housing matters and improve Assembly control on certain types of  statutory rules.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Chairperson and members of the Social  Development Committee for their positive contributions and support in  progressing the Bill. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Social Development (Mr Hamilton)</strong>: On behalf of the  Committee for Social Development, I will make a few remarks as part of the  Final Stage of the Housing (Amendment) Bill. As the Minister said, the Housing  (Amendment) Bill is designed to enhance the legislative framework in respect of  a wide range of housing matters, from homelessness and HMOs to housing  associations and introductory tenancies.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A key part of the Bill is the introduction of a legislative  requirement for the Housing Executive to produce a homelessness strategy. As  the House will be aware, the Housing Executive currently has a range of  anti-homelessness policies that form its &lsquo;Including the Homeless&rsquo; strategy. The  Bill puts the homelessness strategy on a statutory footing and makes its  production and regular renewal a duty that the Housing Executive must  undertake. The Bill also requires key organisations and Departments to take the  strategy into account in the exercise of their functions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In its review of the &lsquo;Including the Homeless&rsquo; strategy, the  Committee indicated that it was pleased with the progress that had been made  and with what had been achieved already. It welcomed the support that  legislation will give to the battle against homelessness. The Bill also refers  to the provision of homelessness advice. The form and type of advice was a  great source of consternation to many witnesses who appeared before the  Committee, particularly those from the voluntary sector. Following the passage  of the Bill, the Committee looks forward to reviewing departmental guidance on  the form and nature of homelessness advice to ensure the delivery of the right  advice in the appropriate format.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 10 of the Housing (Amendment) Bill deals with some  aspects of how the challenge of antisocial behaviour can be dealt with in social  tenancies. Committee members were concerned about the issues raised in that  regard. Almost all members referred to concerns about antisocial behaviour in  their own constituencies. Some were keen to discuss the issues involved,  including the need for social landlords to have a duty of care for existing  tenants; improving information sharing among social landlords; withholding transfers  from tenants who have been sanctioned for antisocial behaviour; and the  provision of better guidance on the better management of antisocial behaviour  issues for social landlords. The Committee looks forward to the Minister&rsquo;s next  housing Bill, which it is understood will go some way to addressing members&rsquo;  concerns in that regard. Members also await with interest the planned  modernisation of the common housing selection scheme. I am sure that that will  be the subject of further discussion today. I do not look at any particular  Members opposite for assurance that they will raise that; indeed, I will be  surprised if they do not.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee anticipates with interest the Department&rsquo;s  review of the housing association guide. That guide is to be amended to require  all social landlords to publish their antisocial behaviour policies and  procedures. The Committee hopes that that will mark a further important stage  in the debate on the alignment of Housing Executive and housing association  tenures.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Members commented on the need to enhance the democratic  accountability of the Housing Executive. Clause 12, which increases the Northern  Ireland Housing Council&rsquo;s represent&shy;ation on the Housing Executive board, goes  some way to allay members&rsquo; concerns in that respect.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The amended Bill ensures that two cohabiting families  retain the protection afforded by HMO registration and the consequent need to  comply with important habitation quality standards. The Bill also includes a  sensible widening of the definition of a family, which ensures that extended  families living in the one house do not have to needlessly register it as an  HMO. The Committee felt that those amendments to the Bill were a useful  compromise but the Department should make further efforts to engage with all  stakeholders on the best way to monitor and improve standards in all HMOs.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The greater part of the Bill refers to social tenancies.  However, the Committee, as part of its consideration of the Bill, briefly  considered issues relating to the mandatory registration of private landlords.  Again, members look forward to the Minister&rsquo;s next housing Bill, which is  expected to introduce measures in that regard. As the Chairperson of the Social  Development Committee, I thank the Minister, her Department and the Committee&rsquo;s  members and staff for their engagement and efforts during the passage of the  Housing (Amendment) Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will make a few remarks about the Bill from personal and  party perspectives. Like every Member and as I have done on behalf of the  Committee, I welcome the fact that the homelessness strategy will be placed on  a statutory footing. We know that the Department has not suddenly realised that  there is a homelessness problem, because it has already been attempting to deal  with it in policy, including the homelessness strategy. We used to pride  ourselves on the fact that Northern    Ireland did not have the visible  manifestation of homelessness that existed in other major cities around the  world. We did not have the large number of rough sleepers that one saw  regularly on television in cities such as London.  Sadly, visible homelessness has become more apparent on the streets of Northern Ireland, principally in the cities of Belfast and Londonderry.  A representative of another city is sitting beside me, and he is too close for  comfort, so I must mention that there are other cities in Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The visible manifestation of rough sleeping, as it is  referred to, is more evident. I am concerned that there is a problem, although  facilities such as the Welcome Centre in Belfast  and First Housing Aid and Support Services in Londonderry  have put in great efforts to tackle rough sleeping. I submitted questions for  written answer to the Minister at the end of last year, because particular problems  with homelessness arise at Christmas. I am pleased to see that the strategy in London&shy;derry resulted in there being no engagements there  over Christmas. That is very positive. Unfortunately, some 118 engagements took  place in Belfast over the same period, although,  historically, Belfast has had more of a  homelessness problem than Londonderry.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A worrying trend in those 118 engagements was that 16 of  them &mdash; 14% &mdash; were foreign nationals. That is a much higher percentage of  foreign nationals than there is in the population of Northern Ireland and, as such, has  to be a cause for concern. I do not want to open up a can of worms, but how we  should engage foreign nationals has been debated and discussed at length in  Committee. Legally, we find it difficult to do anything, yet conscience  dictates that something must be done. Over the course of one month, 14% of  engagements were foreign nationals, and that represents a worrying trend. Over  Christmas, we read in the newspapers the awful story of a foreign national who  had died while sleeping rough. The Department is aware of the problem and needs  to home in on it. I want to see the homelessness strategy deal with the wider  issue of rough sleeping, no matter who is involved or where they come from. It  does Northern Ireland  no good to read headlines such as those that appeared over Christmas.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Much good work goes on. Before Christmas, the Committee  visited the First Housing Aid and Support Services facility in Londonderry, and we were very encouraged by the efforts  made there to tackle homelessness not just by putting a roof over people&rsquo;s head  or giving them shelter but by trying to develop the life skills of those who,  unfortunately, find themselves homeless. I visited the Salvation Army at  Centenary House, where I discussed its report, titled &lsquo;The Seeds of Exclusion  2009&rsquo;, which was launched, with the Minister&rsquo;s assistance, in the Long Gallery  at Parliament Buildings last July. It is a good report, which analyses the  reasons why people find themselves homeless. Two important elements in trying  to prevent homelessness are giving people purpose and building their relationships.  The lessons learned from that report are useful in guiding the direction of a  statutory homelessness strategy for Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We all welcome the fact that the homelessness strategy will  be put on a statutory footing and that the legislation requires a much wider  engagement across other statutory agencies. All Members realise the importance  of that from their experiences and from what they have seen in their  constituencies. I know that I do. Thankfully, the problem of rough sleeping does  not extend too far beyond Belfast and Londonderry. However, there are individuals who may fall  into the trap. Good work is being done in my constituency by the Link Family  and Community Centre in Newtownards, which identifies potential rough sleepers  and works with them to try to stop them falling into that unfortunate trap.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">10.45 am</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Our experiences in our own areas tell us that there is a  need for cross-cutting work on homelessness. That is why it is good to see that  there is provision for homelessness strategies in the Bill. It is also good to  see that all statutory agencies are involved in not only developing  homelessness strategies but in taking them into account.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Provisions to deal with antisocial behaviour are in the  Bill. Indeed, the Committee took time to discuss wider aspects of antisocial  behaviour, although I acknowledge that that matter will probably be better and  more fully addressed in the second housing Bill. It is a bit like buses: we  wait for a housing Bill, and two come along at once. No sooner will we have  dealt with this Bill than the process on the second will start. That is good,  however, and it is good that we are addressing those problems in the right way.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Antisocial behaviour was a common theme in the Committee&rsquo;s  discussions. If any Member were asked about the problems that they have to face  in their ordinary everyday constituency work, they would say that antisocial  behaviour is a real problem in all housing tenures, particularly in social  housing tenure. I welcome the provisions of this Bill, and look forward to  seeing the provisions of the second. I do so as a result of information that I  gleaned that underscores the fact that there are two types of problem.  Responses to questions for written answer show that evictions from Housing Executive  properties over the five years from 2004-05 to 2008-09 rose by 65%. That is an  increase from 26 to 43, which is a pretty small number compared with the  overall number of tenants. However, it is significant that there has been such  a rise, and it obviously indicates that there are increasing problems with  antisocial behaviour.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  Every party has an interest in ensuring that there is legislation to deal with  antisocial activity. However, the figures that the Member quoted hide the  problem, because the vast majority of people who go to court for antisocial  activity get a slap on the wrist. When we come to look at the next housing  Bill, we will have to consider how to tighten the legislation so that people  who push drugs or who are heavily involved in vandalism can be dealt with.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Social Development</strong>: I welcome the Member&rsquo;s  intervention, which was useful. I agree with him, in that even though it is in  some ways encouraging that the number of evictions has gone up, showing that  there is proactive activity, there is a concern that it may be masking what is  going on. That is why it is important that the Housing (Amendment) Bill  requires all social housing landlords to publish their antisocial behaviour  policies. That is an encouraging step. However, the Member is right: we would  like to see more being done.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>:  The Member spoke about masking the difficulties of antisocial behaviour. As a  member of the Committee for Social Development and of the Public Accounts  Committee, I know that one issue that is raised time and again is that, under  the Freedom of Information Act 2000, all bodies are playing safe, in that they  are not sharing among themselves the appropriate information about tenants.  Such bodies include housing associations and the Housing Executive. That may  not be a legal constraint, but there is no legal imperative on them to share  such information. As a result, a lot of antisocial behaviour problems go  unanswered or are not dealt with. I would like to see that legal imperative put  on housing associations and the Housing Executive so that the issue can be  tackled. It should perhaps be not in this Bill but in the next housing Bill.  Would the Member agree?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Social Development</strong>: I certainly agree with anything  that can be done, and the Housing (Amendment) Bill is an important first step  in addressing antisocial behaviour by ensuring that all social landlords  publish their policies on antisocial behaviour. As I said, that is an important  move in better aligning different social landlords. Of course, there is more  work to be done. That is acknowledged by the Department, which will produce  another Bill to look at that issue. I look forward to examining that more  closely in Committee.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I identified the first problem of the increase in  evictions. In some respects, however, that is positive and negative. The other  issue that I noticed from the same answer is that the number of evictions of  housing association tenants over that same period was fewer than 20. Although  there are more Housing Executive properties than housing association  properties, the gap is closing all the time. However, there were no evictions  for antisocial behaviour from housing association properties in 2004-05, and  there were only two in 2006-07. I cannot believe that there were only two  incidents of antisocial behaviour in those years when there were 26 and 17  evictions respectively from Housing Executive properties during the same  period.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Bill includes the important point that there needs to  be a better alignment of social landlords, which, equally, has to carry forward  into antisocial behaviour. The second Bill must ensure that there is better  alignment and more power for the Housing Executive or housing associations to  better deal with antisocial behaviour. I look forward to considering that Bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It sounds as though I am being critical of housing  associations, but I am not. The Minister regularly reminds us of the growing  number of housing association properties that are being built across Northern Ireland,  which is good to see. I put it on record that, when I have dealt with housing  associations at constituency level, I have only ever found them to be very good  at dealing with antisocial behaviour problems. Likewise, the Housing Executive  is very good and very responsive, although tenants do not always get the result  that they want.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We had a debate yesterday about repairs and maintenance.  That could be reflected today in that there is a particular duty on existing  tenants. After all, they pay their rent. They nearly have a duty, in some  people&rsquo;s minds, above and beyond those who are on the social housing waiting  list because they are already in a property. I very much look forward to any  enhancement of the powers and abilities of the Housing Executive and housing  associations to tackle the problem of antisocial behaviour.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There has been a 65% increase in evictions over the past  five years. That highlights the problem of which we are all aware. It is good  and positive to see that the Housing Executive is able to use the mechanisms  that it has available to tackle &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>: I  thank the Member for giving way for a second time. When it comes to dealing  with major antisocial behaviour in a household, the housing associations and  the Housing Executive have the remit only to rehouse those individuals  elsewhere. Legislation has been looked at that states that, after three  strikes, there is no more legal obligation to house such individuals. I support  such legislation. What is the Chairperson&rsquo;s opinion? My experience of cases in  which individuals refuse to reform is that we end up simply moving them about  the countryside until we eventually get them far enough away. We almost find a  field for them somewhere. That is not a great solution. There has to be a  better way of dealing with the problem.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Social Development</strong>: I am not sure where that field  would be located; I am sure that that would also be a problem. A Member for West Belfast on the opposite Benches, Fra McCann, always  reminds us that 20% of his constituency is rural. I do not know whether he  wants to offer part of Divis   Mountain for that  purpose.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  I was talking about hill farmers in West Belfast  yesterday.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Social Development</strong>: I suggest that that is a different  type of hill farming, Mr Deputy Speaker.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I reiterate Mr Craig&rsquo;s point about the need for better  alignment of antisocial behaviour policies between social landlords, and there  is a requirement in the Bill for the publication of existing antisocial  behaviour policies. In the past, it has sometimes been difficult to see exactly  what those policies were. Publication is an important first step. I am open, as  are other Committee members and, I hope, the Minister and her Department, to  looking at all innovative ideas and trying to dream up some of our own to  address antisocial behaviour while also considering experiences elsewhere.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Antisocial behaviour is a catch-all phrase for everything  from kids playing football in the street &mdash; the sort of stuff that I did as a  youngster without considering myself in any way antisocial; in fact, Members  may consider the behaviour that the Deputy Speaker lets me get away with in the  Chamber more antisocial &mdash; right up to really antisocial problems that we all  recognise as a scourge on society.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>:  Does the Member agree that housing associations must share more information  between themselves and with the Housing Executive? Differing guidelines often  lead to a lack of information sharing and of understanding, which contributes  to moving the problem of antisocial behaviour around. There is a serious need  for clarification and joined-up thinking.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Social Development</strong>: I thank the Member for his  intervention. I know that he has constituency concerns about antisocial  behaviour addressed in the Bill. He has raised it a number of times inside and  outside the Committee.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The information sharing that he refers to is one of the  more basic elements that the Committee and I, as a Member, would be looking for  in a future housing Bill. That relates to the point relayed by our colleague Mr  Craig, who said that the problem can be moved around because there is a lack of  information sharing. There is no legal requirement for information about  somebody&rsquo;s past antisocial behaviour, convictions or sanctions to be passed,  for example, from the Housing Executive to a housing association. The problem  can be moved, but the information cannot. Understandably, that leads to all  sorts of problems such as people who have a history of antisocial behaviour for  which they have been sanctioned being moved to an utterly inappropriate area.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We can all think of examples. As I speak, I have an example  in the forefront of my mind that involves exactly such a problem: a family with  a history of antisocial behaviour being moved from one district to another and  then another. The problem does not go away; it simply gets moved, and the only  solution is to move it again. The argument comes back to Mr Craig&rsquo;s point that  there must be some examination, if not adoption, of the idea that people should  be given a limited number of chances. That, of itself, would move the problem  around. A three-strike approach would mean that, ultimately, when somebody has  a third strike they have to be moved somewhere else. That is a very emotive  issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee welcomed the inclusion of the clause in  respect of the publication of all information. I regard that as a good,  positive and necessary first step that I want to see delivered.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 12 increases the democratic element of the Northern  Ireland Housing Executive&rsquo;s board by having four or more members of the Housing  Council on it. That is positive. My colleagues and I held a personal view that  that requirement could have been a bit more robust. Under RPA, there is a trend  towards institutions in health or libraries having a greater number of elected  representatives on public bodies, such as the Housing Executive board, however  that requirement is constituted. Nevertheless, what is included in the Bill is  an important and positive move in the right direction. Granted, I would have  preferred it to be more robust, but at least it is a positive move in the right  direction.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.00 am</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am about to steal another Member&rsquo;s thunder, but the  housing selection scheme is another issue on which I wish to touch. During the  Bill&rsquo;s various stages, the matter was raised at length in the Chamber and in Committee,  and no doubt it will be raised in the future. The issue is being discussed a  lot, particularly in light of suggestions made in the Commission on the Future  for Housing in Northern    Ireland&rsquo;s report, which challenged the  housing selection scheme&rsquo;s orthodoxy. If one were to ask every Member in the  Chamber, it would not take long for them all to identify problems with the  housing selection scheme. Clearly, there must be some mechanism with which to  allocate housing, and any mechanism must be fair, equitable and unbiased. Every  Member is aware of and could hark back to problems that existed years ago, and  those problems cannot and should not be repeated. However, having grown up and  being a bit more mature, we are now able to look at the housing selection  scheme and conclude that it is not working in the way that we would wish.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>:  The Chairperson of the Committee for Social Development referred to  homelessness and to the fact that people are living on the street. In my  experience, it is normally young men who have to sleep rough. Frankly, if you  are a single, young man, the housing selection scheme lets you down big time.  You have no chance of being housed in a Housing Executive or housing  association property. Instead, you will be directed towards one of the  shelters, which may or may not be suitable. Does the Chairperson agree that  that issue must be revisited?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Social Development</strong>: The homelessness strategy is a  cornerstone achievement of the Bill. Earlier, I concentrated on people&rsquo;s  automatic perception of homelessness, which is one of rough sleeping, but  homelessness also exists in a broader sense. The Member raised an important  point: tackling homelessness and the housing selection scheme is connected. As  the Minister will no doubt remind us, while there are not enough houses to  house those who are on the waiting list, homelessness will be a problem.  Looking at how the housing selection scheme is constituted, we could all come  up with various problems with it, including the fact that it does not give  preferential treatment to people who want to stay in their own area in order to  retain and to build their community; it does not recognise people who have been  on the waiting list for a long time; it sometimes puts people who are desperate  for any house into one that is inappropriate &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  The Member will excuse me for thinking that this debate is taking longer than  the one at Consideration Stage. Some might even think that we are  filibustering.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Social Development</strong>: Perhaps I should read out recipes.  Given the seriousness of the issue that we are discussing, I regret that the  Member should have made those comments. Everyone in the House who takes  homelessness seriously would want to spend as much time on the subject as  possible. The Member often talks about how dysfunctional we all are; yet, here  we are debating a good piece of legislation that will tackle problems that are  dear to my heart, other Members&rsquo; hearts and the hearts of everyone in society,  and the Member criticises and wants to stymie that debate. We should be proud  that we are passing this legislation today.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The issue that Mr Craig raised highlights the need for  reform of the selection scheme. Mr Deputy Speaker, I will not push your  patience any further in respect of other issues that were raised, such as a  mandatory registration scheme. However, I have spoken in other debates in the  House of my view that although mandatory registration of private-sector landlords  is desirable in a perfect environment, the light-touch scheme that the Minister  seems to be heading towards is probably the optimum system that we can get at  the moment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, on behalf of my DUP colleagues who sit on  the Social Development Committee, I thank not only the Minister for her time,  patience, effort and energy in bringing the Bill forward but the officials in  her Department. I also thank all the witnesses who gave oral and written  evidence on the Bill. We had very good legislation at the start, and it was  enhanced by the contribution that was made through the Committee. That  contribution could not have been made by the Committee alone; it was made  because of the evidence that was gleaned from the many witnesses. We all,  including the Minister, the Department, the Committee, the House and Northern Ireland,  benefited from the efforts of stakeholders who take a keen interest in housing  issues. Their work helped us to enhance the Bill, and I wish to record my  personal thanks and the thanks of my party colleagues for that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Contrary to all the accusations that are made about what  goes on in this place, or, rather, the accusations about what does not go on in  this place, a piece of good legislation will be passed today. It will tackle an  important issue that is fundamental to a good society by addressing  homelessness through a statutory strategy to deal with a problem that afflicts  not just Belfast and Londonderry  but all towns. The Bill is important, and it makes significant progress in  respect of antisocial behaviour, which I mentioned before at length, and other  issues. Therefore, I welcome it. It is good legislation, and it is one example  of the Assembly doing its best to make a difference for everyone in Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I said before, these Bills are like buses. Another  housing Bill will come forward as soon as we finish this one. However, I  welcome that, because it will take some of those issues that we have raised  today and that the Committee raised during its deliberations &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Social Development</strong>: I am trying to build to a  crescendo, but I will give way.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>:  The Member mentioned private landlords having to register. What penalties will  be in place for private landlords who fail to register?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Social Development</strong>: I wish that I could use my phone  to Google an answer to that question. At this stage, there is no requirement to  register. I feel like giving way to the Minister to let her use her expertise  to answer that question, but perhaps she can address it later through her  officials. Nevertheless, there is no scheme in place at this stage, but there  is a need to develop one. There is no point in having a scheme in place if it is  not robustly backed up by fines of some kind. Indeed, any scheme would be  belittled if there were no fines at all. However, the Private Tenancies (Northern Ireland)  Order 2006 requires the registration of HMOs, and the suggestion is that there  should be a &pound;20,000 fine for failure to comply. Therefore, that is the sort of  penalty that we would be looking at.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will try to conclude again. I look forward to that  further Bill, because it will address different issues, and it will further  enhance &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Donaldson</strong>:  In addressing the issue of homelessness, is the housing allocation scheme  brought into the frame? I have evidence that, in my constituency, homeless  people have priority for housing, but people who live with their parents have  difficulty in becoming registered as homeless, and that tends to discriminate  against younger people. Is there anything in the Bill that will address that,  or will it be dealt with in the next phase of legislation?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Social Development</strong>: I thank the Member for his  intervention; he has raised an important issue. The homelessness strategy,  which will build on the Including the Homeless strategy that is in place, needs  to be mindful of that issue. The Department must also be mindful that the two  are not separate in any way. Homelessness is a problem that does not stand on  its own. Factors such as the housing allocation scheme or the common selection  scheme play into it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I said before, there is no perfect scheme. There will  always be people on the waiting list, but improvements can be made. I look to  the Department to come up with ways to make improvements in its regular reviews  of the common selection scheme. The Committee has put a lot of pressure on the  Department to come forward with a more fundamental review than those that have  been undertaken in the past. I am in favour of that, because some options, such  as the scheme that was put forward by the Commission on the Future for Housing  in Northern Ireland  in its recent paper, are worth examining. I do not think that that scheme would  totally eradicate the waiting list &mdash; the building or freeing up of houses is  the only measure that will do that &mdash; but it may be able to give some attention  to the problem that the Member raises, and, hopefully, tackle it more  positively than it is being tackled now. I look forward to seeing how the next  Bill that the Minister bring forwards will treat that issue and others, such as  antisocial behaviour and the registration of private landlords.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It gives me great pleasure to be able to give my support to  the Housing (Amendment) Bill, and I encourage Members to do likewise.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  Minister, a LeasCheann Comhairle, a chairde. The Bill has been debated at  Committee and is now on its passage through the House. There was general  acceptance by the Committee that it would support the Bill as it stands, and I  hope that it makes life easier for those who find themselves homeless.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">During Committee Stage, we discussed and debated the time  frame in which a home&shy;lessness strategy should be formulated, and we eventually  agreed, with some reservations, that it would be every five years, with a  12-month review to take account of any changes that may arise. After Committee  discussion and debate on which bodies should be consulted on a homelessness  strategy, the Department eventually accepted the proposal that local government  and several other bodies be included. The Committee also raised the issue of  translation services for those who do not speak English as their first  language. The Department advised us that a range of interpreters was available  and widely publicised in areas where ethnic minorities reside. That is a  Housing Executive responsibility, and the Committee accepted departmental  assurances on the matter.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee also advised the Department that some groups  were in favour of the removal of the intentionality and priority need clauses  in homelessness cases. The Department pointed out that there were concerns that  the removal of those clauses would have a detrimental impact on people who were  applying under the common selection scheme and those who were declaring  themselves homeless. The Committee accepted that explanation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Chairperson of the Committee for Social Development  spoke about the common selection scheme. I raised concerns about that scheme,  and I have been assured that reviews are to be carried out into discriminatory  practices. I am surprised that that was not dealt with before now, given that  it condemns many people to years in hostels or overcrowded conditions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 10 places a duty on all housing associations and the  Housing Executive to publish their policies on antisocial behaviour. We have  asked for the addition of several amendments regarding antisocial activity. One  of those relates to the duty of care, which, as it stands, takes no account of  the wishes of local residents when antisocial people or families are being  moved into an area. Housing authorities claim that their duty of care relates  only to the applicant.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee also wanted to table an amendment to allow  for the sharing of information between housing associations and the Housing  Executive to ensure that relevant and important facts about problem individuals  and families are made known to all necessary authorities. We were assured that  those issues would be picked up in the new housing Bill, which will soon come  before the Committee.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Other issues that were raised and discussed include the  legal definition of HMOs; homeless&shy;ness advice and who should be giving it; the  increase in the number of people from the Housing Council who are nominated to  sit on the Housing Executive board; the rights of immigrants on arrival and the  Housing Executive&rsquo;s responsibility to provide temporary accommodation for them;  obligations under section 75; mandatory registration of the private-rented  sector, which will be dealt with by the proposed housing Bill; the extension of  the length of time for a review of a decision to refuse homeless status to  someone from 21 days to 28 days; widening the remit of the Housing Executive to  bring in others to deliver advice on its behalf; and the abandonment of  introductory tenancies, which will allow landlords to claim back their  properties.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.15 am</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee agreed to support certain aspects of the  Housing (Amendment) Bill, while others provoked heavy debate. Fortunately for  both the Department and the Committee, we were able to reach compromise.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Committee Clerks and the Department for their  work and the advice that they supplied to us throughout our consideration of  the Bill. It is quite obvious that substantial work is done outside Committees  to ensure that Bills become law. I support the Bill.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>: I,  too, support the Bill and its principles. It is important that the Bill deals  with a lot of issues, such as the homelessness strategy, HMOs, and how to  manage individuals who are homeless.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although there is a lot of good stuff in the Bill, I share  concerns that members raised during Committee Stage with regard to the common  selection scheme. I want to reiterate the point that has been raised. The  Chairman, quite rightly, stated that people now sleep rough on the streets. The  issue is not just that those people may have come from other countries.  Although that is an issue, it is not predominant. Unfortunately, the problem is  becoming more common in all our cities. I include all four of them in that  statement.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Social Development</strong>: Five &mdash; Armagh.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>:  Five cities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Unfortunately, people are now sleeping on the streets. In  my experience, many are young people, particularly men, who have fallen through  the system. There is a huge problem. The system was designed to deal with past  issues, and did so quite well. However, it needs to be looked at again and  reformed in order to do away, if at all possible, with the problem of young  people ending up sleeping on the streets.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>:  Does the Member agree that the Bill does not tackle the question of how we are  going to get this information out to the people who sleep on the streets?  Although there is a duty on the Housing Executive to provide that information  for free, a substantial section of the community will not know about the new  regulations and rules and will slip through the system.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>: I  thank the Member for his intervention. One issue that was certainly dealt with  at length in the Committee was how to share information with those who have,  regrettably, slipped through the system in Northern Ireland. It is difficult  to reach out to that group. I hope that the Department will look at how to deal  more closely with organisations that specialise in reaching out to those  individuals.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: I  thank the Member for giving way. Does he agree that proper resourcing of the  voluntary sector is needed in that regard? A number of community groups and  women&rsquo;s groups are still waiting for confirmation on whether they are getting  funding from DSD to continue their work. A number of those organisations give out  information on homelessness prevention and other benefits issues. The  Department must look at that.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>: I  thank the Member for that thought-provoking intervention. She knows well and  truly that that issue is close to my heart. I agree with her on the need to get  funding out to such groups that, perhaps, work more closely with those people  than government organisations.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I was about to touch on that subject with regard to  faith-based voluntary organisations. The Assembly needs to bury the hatchet and  deal with that issue. A lot of those organisations reach out to homeless people  in greater depth than government organisations or even independent voluntary  organisations.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will advertise here: I am speaking to such an  organisation next week. Hopefully, in future, we will recognise the value of  those organisations and get the Department to work that bit closer with them to  solve the problem of people sleeping on the streets.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  The Member is talking about the important subject of people sleeping rough. I  agree with him, and the Committee discussed ways in which those people could be  helped. Groups such as the Simon Community and the Salvation Army provide  shelters. However, I agree that it is difficult, especially for young men, to  find accommodation at night. As far as my area of Belfast is concerned, the Welcome Centre has  a particular focus on helping people who are sleeping rough. Those  organisations need to be brought on board, because they think outside the box  when it comes to dealing with such problems and difficulties. If they were to  appear before the Committee to share their wealth of information, we could  start to build a strategy that would allow us to deal with the situation. Anna  Lo is right; resources are needed to deliver those services.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>: I  concur fully with the Member&rsquo;s comments. I have personal experience of those  issues. I have contact with a faith-based organisation in my constituency that  deals with dropouts from society who have found themselves in that situation  because of drug addition. That organisation has had to be very resourceful to  find funding through all sorts of avenues. Unfortunately, Departments do not  want to know. Once the involvement of the Church is mentioned, government seems  to run a mile, which is unfortunate, because the Church is delivering an  extremely effective service on the ground for those individuals. However, I  hope that the Department will look at that matter further.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Clause 12, which concerns the make-up of the executive of  the Housing Executive and its board, was raised again during Committee Stage.  Unfortunately, when I raised the issue, I did not get very far. Only four out  of the 10 members on the board are elected.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>:  Obviously, one would like to think that elected members on the board act as  advocates for tenants. Has there been any discussion by the Committee or the  Department about having a tenants&rsquo; advocate on the board, so that the many  tenants throughout the country would have a voice and feel that they are being  listened to? I know that it is not in the Bill, but has the Department pledged  to reconsider the situation in the near future?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>:  There were two issues raised at the Committee. The first related to the number  of elected members on the board, and I feel very strongly on that issue. There  is a democratic deficit in all those outside boards, or quangos, as I properly  call them. They are quasi-governmental and are responsible to the Department,  yet they are independent. Elected members do not have the majority voice on the  board. Unfortunately, the Minister did not agree with my arguments. Will she  explain why there is disagreement on that issue, as I would like to bring  democratic accountability to all those quasi-governmental organisations as it  would be more beneficial to the community?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The other issue, which was raised by my colleague, is that  of a tenants&rsquo; advocate. There was a high degree of agreement in the Committee  about having some form of tenants&rsquo; advocate on the board, which would enable  tenants to have a more direct way in which to raise the issues that they have  with Housing Executive properties. Although there was widespread agreement that  a tenants&rsquo; advocate should be on the board, agreement has not yet been reached  on how to deliver that, given that several issues must be taken into account.  It involves not only Housing Executive tenants but an increasing number of  tenants in the housing association sector. I hope that the Minister will take  on board the point that, directly or indirectly, a tenants&rsquo; advocate should  feed into the board. I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say  about all the issues that I have raised.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank Members for their contributions. I absolutely  marvel at the filibustering devices that were used in the debate, obviously to  cause obfuscation before we debate the devolution of policing and justice  powers. I admire Members&rsquo; interest in housing issues, particularly homelessness  and the need for proper inclusion, which is the very thing that I hope will be  supported in the new housing agenda.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I now turn to the issues that Members raised. The  Chairperson of the Committee for Social Development, Simon Hamilton, raised  several issues. He asked whether the Committee will have sight of the guidance  on homelessness that will be produced under clause 2 of the Bill. I reassure  the Chairperson that my officials will discuss any such draft guidance that is  due to be produced after the Bill receives Royal Assent. He also asked whether  DSD will consult on the improvement of standards in houses in multiple  occupation. That issue was raised during Consideration Stage, when I stated  quite clearly, and I confirm today, that my proposals for a further housing  Bill include measures that are aimed at improving the regulation of houses in  multiple occupation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Housing Executive deal with rough sleeping and  foreign nationals? I am also aware of the problems that Mr Hamilton raised, and  I am happy to work with the Housing Executive to ensure that all reasonable  measures are taken to address the issue of rough sleeping through the Housing  Executive&rsquo;s homelessness strategy. Members will recall all the actions that  were taken in June 2009 during the crisis that was precipitated by Romanian  families being intimidated out of their homes. We took every possible step to  ensure that the families received emergency accommodation after the unwarranted  attacks on them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Jonathan Craig raised the issue of &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: Will  the Minister give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: No, I will continue; I may give way later.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Craig spoke about the legislation on information sharing  to deal with antisocial behaviour. I want Members to be absolutely clear about  that matter. Measures to deal with antisocial behaviour are, in the first  instance, policing measures. However, the consultation paper that was published  on 7 December 2009 included proposals for new legislation to enable relevant organisations  to share information about antisocial behaviour if that would allow the Housing  Executive to refuse permission for an exchange of tenancies or a house sale.  Future initiatives on information sharing are planned.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Chairperson and Jonathan Craig talked about the &ldquo;three  strikes and you&rsquo;re out&rdquo; legislation to deal with antisocial behaviour. Existing  legislation states that the Housing Executive is not required to provide  housing for individuals who are not deemed to be suitable tenants because of  their unacceptable behaviour. I emphasise that individuals are not permanently  excluded from social housing under that legislation because it is possible that  those who moderate their behaviour could be housed in the future. As Minister,  I wish to be sensitive to all people who find themselves in such situations,  including those who are homeless and those living in difficult circumstances on  housing estates where there is antisocial behaviour. Alex Easton also raised  the issues of antisocial behaviour and information sharing. I have amplified  the issue clearly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Chairperson and Jonathan Craig talked about the common  selection scheme and dealing with homelessness.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As Committee members will be well aware, I am examining  ways of modernising the common selection scheme to address a number of issues,  including those raised by Committee members.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.30 am</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am also examining a range of other innovative ways of  addressing homelessness, including making greater use of the private rented  sector in appropriate ways. It is worth noting that the private rented sector  has an equal number of portfolios as are owned by the Northern Ireland Housing  Executive.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Yesterday, I referred to a useful statistic on unfitness in  the private rented sector. As a result of research and a good evidence base  from the house conditions survey of last year, it has now emerged that levels  of unfitness have gradually decreased and are down to around 0&middot;2% in the  housing association sector and the Housing Executive sector. I am sure that all  Members will welcome that information, and it shows clearly that we in DSD, the  Housing Executive and the housing associations are doing everything in our  power and authority to tackle the issue of unfitness and make houses fit for  people to live in, particularly for people who find themselves homeless.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Alex Easton also raised the issue of landlord registration  and of penalties for landlords who fail to register. I have signalled my  intention already to bring forward legislation for a landlord registration  scheme, and I shall consider the issues that the Member raised about penalties  for failure to register.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Jonathan Craig and Simon Hamilton raised the issue of rough  sleeping and the sharing of information. I want Members to be aware of the fact  that the Housing Executive monitors regularly patterns of rough sleeping in Belfast and Derry.  Thankfully, the number of people who are sleeping rough remains small. However,  I am not complacent on the issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Anna Lo raised the issue of funding to the voluntary  sector, and work is done on the issue through funding programmes such as  Supporting People and work with the Housing Executive on a new homelessness  strategy. This time last year, I took a decision to increase the budget for  Supporting People to ensure that vulnerable people were protected. That  includes people who might otherwise find themselves in a more vulnerable  position or who might otherwise find themselves homeless. I am leading the way  on tackling the issue and ensuring that all homeless people receive the support  and services that they require.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Jonathan Craig raised the issue of the Housing Executive&rsquo;s  composition and the whole area of tenant representation through a tenant  advocate. It may be useful for the House to know that appointments to the board  of the Housing Executive are made in line with the code of practice that is  issued by the Commissioner for Public Appointments and that the ultimate  responsibility for appointments lies with the Minister. The process must be  governed by the overriding principle of selection based on merit, and  appointments must be made on the basis of the well-informed choice of  applicants, who, through their abilities, experience and qualities, match the  needs of the public body. That means that an individual could not simply be  appointed to the board as an advocate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, there is nothing to prevent any person who feels  that they are in a position to represent the interests of tenants from applying  through the public appointments process. I have talked to the elected  representatives on the board of the Housing Executive, who originate from the  Housing Council, and the broad Housing Council. From that, I know that the  people who we have appointed and who have been appointed by the respective  district councils are ably qualified to act on housing policy and on how they  see the future of housing. As far as housing provision is concerned, they will  be able to deliver the Minister&rsquo;s new housing agenda and act as very good  tenants&rsquo; advocates in their own way. They raise issues with me on the broad  spectrum of planned maintenance, newbuild programmes, multi-element improvement  schemes, homeless&shy;ness and a whole range of housing matters.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Jonathan Craig also raised the issue of faith-based  organisations. He will recall that during a debate some weeks ago on a motion  that was tabled by Members of his party &mdash; in fact, it was tabled by the  Chairperson of the Social Development Committee &mdash; I said that I had provided  funding for a pilot research programme to undertake a survey into the good work  that is being undertaken by faith-based organisations in Northern Ireland, both  Christian and non-Christian, because I quickly realised that they do an  excellent job in that respect.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am grateful to the Committee for Social Development and  Members for their positive contribution to the progress of the Housing  (Amendment) Bill and for the high level of consensus that the Bill has enjoyed.  I now look forward to taking forward the second housing Bill, which will deal  with a plethora of issues, including the regulation of landlords, the private  rented strategy and other issues relating to the further implementation of the  new housing agenda. I commend the Housing (Amendment) Bill to the House.</p>

    <p class="B3BodyText">Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Just over a month  ago, the First Minister and I declared in the Hillsborough Castle Agreement  that we would jointly table an Assembly motion for a resolution for this day, 9  March 2010. The motion, the debate and the vote that will conclude it are long  overdue and are crucial to the Assembly&rsquo;s attainment of policing and justice  responsibilities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In November 2008, the First Minister and I made public a  process paper setting out the steps towards devolution. We have now reached the  final group of actions in that process paper. Since November 2008, we have  witnessed the Assembly and Executive Review Committee&rsquo;s thorough and essential  groundwork in preparing for policing and justice devolution. Its January 2009  report, which was endorsed by the Assembly, identified the necessary modalities  for devolution, and those have shaped subsequent legislation. We have seen Westminster legislation  to amend the Northern Ireland Act in line with the Committee&rsquo;s recommendations.  We are indebted to the Committee for that work.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Today, the Committee is publishing its third comprehensive  report on policing and justice within the space of two years. That is a  considerable output for any Assembly Committee, and we hope that the latest  volume, together with those that have gone before it, will inform the  Assembly&rsquo;s deliberations today. We all owe a considerable debt of gratitude to  the Chairperson, Jimmy Spratt, to his predecessor, Jeffrey Donaldson, to the  Deputy Chairperson, Raymond McCartney, and to all current and previous  Committee members.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Last year, the House experienced long and comprehensive  debates on the Department of Justice Bill. That Act will enable us to establish  a Department. We also saw the successful outcome of the intensive negotiations  that the First Minister and I held with Gordon Brown last autumn to address the  financial pressures that the policing and justice agencies will face in the  coming years. It is clear that the additional &pound;800 million in finance is  entirely dependent on the successful transfer of policing and justice  responsibilities at this time.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion is long &mdash; some would say cumbersome &mdash; and there  is a reason for that. It is designed to align closely with the Order that the  Secretary of State will lay at Westminster.  We have decided to err on the side of completeness and transparency in the  motion to ensure that everyone understands what is being proposed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are some in the Chamber who have expressed concerns  about the course of action on which we are embarked. That is understandable, as  these are uncharted waters. However, we know that the transfer of these powers  makes sense. The community knows it and supports this course of action.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Last night, the Ulster Unionist Party declared that it will  not support the motion. That saddens and disappoints me. In my view, they are  opposed to the transfer of policing and justice powers for cynical party  political reasons. Since losing the leadership of unionism, and since the  re-establishment of the Assembly and the Executive, the Ulster Unionist Party  has set out to portray the Executive as dysfunctional. An Executive designed  and agreed to serve all the people &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. Every Member will have an opportunity to speak in the debate and should  allow the deputy First Minister to proceed.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The deputy First  Minister</strong>: An Executive designed and agreed to serve all the people. An Executive  supported by public opinion, which wants to see them work and deliver.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Ulster Unionist Party maintains that it is opposed to  the Hillsborough agreement, an agreement welcomed by its senior partners in the  British Conservative Party. The Hillsborough agreement established a committee  to determine how the Executive could function better, and that committee is  co-chaired by the leader of the UUP. The position that the UUP has put forward  to us in the past couple of days would give them a veto on the Executive and on  the work of each Minister. That is a recipe for delay and disagreement. The  Ulster Unionist Party&rsquo;s proposals seek to undermine the safeguards of the Good  Friday Agreement and are designed to be unworkable and unsupportable. It is a party  that complains about not being involved in decision-making, yet it refuses to  make any contribution and boycotted the final session at Hillsborough with the  Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister. On top of that, the UUP is on record  as stating that it will not support the election of a local Minister to oversee  the administration of policing and justice until there is agreement to test 10-  and 11-year-old children to determine which school they should attend. Those  are the most dysfunctional political positions that I have ever come across.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Let me be the first to recognise that there have been  difficulties in the Executive. My views on that were aired in the past and are  a matter of public record. However, the Executive are a body made up of parties  that have different political and national outlooks. That body has been in  existence for only three years and can only work effectively with parties that  want to contribute and to be involved. The Executive are relatively new and  include some political leaders who had never spoken to me before the Executive  were set up.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It was always going to be difficult to build and maintain  relationships and working practices, and throughout the period, the  institutions have continued to deliver. I would have preferred it if we had  made and implemented agreements earlier, but we are where we are. The  Hillsborough agreement provides an opportunity for a new start.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The process that we are engaged in is one that no single  party can dominate and control. It demands that we all work together for the  common good and to maintain the political stability that will deliver  prosperity, quality public services and investment. I acknowledge that it is a  challenge to us all, but it is one to which we all must rise. We must put aside  party political posturing and begin an era of joint and equal working.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.45 am</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I note that former Congressman Jim Walsh, who is a great  friend of the peace process and Ireland,  will be here with us today to witness the vote. Jim, like many other  Congressmen, has supported the peace process and the search for prosperity and  investment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Next week, the First Minister and I will travel to the United States  to meet political and business leaders. As we set about the task of delivering  investment, I am conscious that the special economic envoy, Declan Kelly, has  articulated the view of potential investors that political stability is  crucial. Those investors cannot understand why any party would be opposed to  having a politically accountable policing and justice service. Indeed, in the  words of one commentator, it is a no-brainer. How can the Ulster Unionist Party  argue that the Executive must address the pain of unemployment that is felt in  communities across the North and, at the same time, undermine the institutions  and our actions to promote investment, growth and jobs? As we prepare to travel  to the United States,  investors and political leaders, from President Obama down, are watching  developments here very closely. We can send out a strong message to investors  that the institutions are robust and stable and have the support of all and  that we are open for business.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A process was agreed between the parties at Hillsborough,  and it is a local agreement that is free from the patronage of the British and  Irish Governments. It is our agreement, and, as a result, it is much stronger  and more valuable. Parties set aside party political positions for the common  good. It was a challenge, but it was one that we met. It is another step in the  maturing of politics here, and it should mark a step change in which parties  set aside party political positions for the common good. We must recommit to  finding solutions rather than restating positions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Agreement at Hillsborough   Castle is a good agreement  for our entire community. Let us move on and address the challenges that we  face to build prosperity and deliver for all of our people. It is time to get  on with the job that we were elected to do. It is time for a new start and a  new beginning. I commend the motion to the House.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Assembly and Executive Review Committee (Mr Spratt)</strong>: I declare an  interest as a member of the Northern Ireland Policing Board. I thank the  Business Committee for its foresight in providing me with sufficient time to  speak on the debate today at an early stage. I acknowledge the Business  Committee&rsquo;s recognition that this is a unique situation and that the devolution  of policing and justice powers is a matter of great significance to the House  and the people whom we represent. The Assembly and Executive Review Committee  believes that the work that it has done on the devolution of policing and  justice matters will be of interest to Members and the wider public.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As the deputy First Minister said just a few moments ago,  the Agreement at Hillsborough   Castle included a  timetable for the devolution of policing and justice matters. Throughout the  negotiations that led up to that agreement, I had a sense that members of the  Assembly and Executive Review Committee were among those most keenly interested  in what might be in that agreement, and they had good reason to be.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Back in 2007, the Assembly agreed that the Assembly and  Executive Review Committee should conduct an inquiry into the devolution of  policing and justice matters. A report on that inquiry, which included details  of the powers to be transferred, was endorsed by the Assembly on 11 March 2008.  The Committee published its first report on the arrangements for the devolution  of policing and justice matters on 6 January 2009. That report dealt with the  structures for a Department of Justice and the arrangements for the appointment  of a Justice Minister.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee then turned its attention to the remaining  matters that it considered needed to be addressed prior to any possible request  for powers to be devolved. In light of the Agreement at Hillsborough Castle,  the Committee decided that it might be helpful to produce its &lsquo;Second Report on  the Arrangements for the Devolution of Policing and Justice Matters&rsquo; in time to  inform today&rsquo;s debate. Late last week, Members were provided with an advance  and embargoed copy of the report. It is important that the report is read in  conjunction with the other two related reports and the process paper, which was  published by the First Minister and deputy First Minister on 18 November 2008.  A copy can be found in appendix 5 to the second report, from page 215 onwards.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion refers to the powers to be transferred. They  appear to be consistent with the powers identified in recommendations 2 to 17  of the Committee&rsquo;s &lsquo;Report on the Inquiry into the Devolution of Policing and  Justice Matters&rsquo;, which was published in 2008. However, the House would find it  helpful if the First Minister, in his closing remarks to the debate, would  confirm that the request for the transfer of powers is entirely consistent with  the earlier wish of the Assembly. If that is not the case, it is reasonable  that the First Minister should explain why there is a divergence and what it  is.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to give the Assembly some sense of the co-operation,  and the occasional lack of co-operation, as the Committee went about its work.  The four political parties that were represented on the Committee worked  together on the report. We may not always have agreed on certain matters, as is  evident from the report, but all the meetings were well attended, and members  always had an opportunity to state their views. We also offered those parties  that were not represented on the Committee observer status while we were  discussing devolution.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee made a submission to the Committee for the  Office of First Minister and deputy First Minister to assist it in its scrutiny  of the Department of Justice Bill, which was taken through the House last year  and has since been granted Royal Assent. That Committee appreciated our  assistance.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee worked closely with the Committee on  Procedures on the Standing Orders that were required to accommodate devolution.  I will return to that point later.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee did its best to keep the Committee for  Finance and Personnel informed of its work, and, assuming that the motion  receives the necessary support today, I wish that Committee well in its  deliberations on the budget for the new Department.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee gathered and examined a significant amount of  written and oral evidence. I wish to thank the specialist adviser to the  Committee, Victor Hewitt from the Economic Research Institute, for his work,  which can be found in appendix 3 to the report, from page 141 onwards. On that  note, and before I turn to co-operation with others, I want to acknowledge, on  behalf of all Committee members, the co-operation and commitment of the  Committee Clerk and his staff. Their standards of professionalism,  impartiality, integrity and organisational skills, together with their appreciation  and understanding of the subject, which was often discussed in a politically  charged atmosphere, served the Committee well.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As part of its deliberations, the Committee visited  parliamentary colleagues and officials in London,  Edinburgh and Dublin. We were warmly received, had helpful  discussions and met each of the Justice Ministers and representatives of the  Justice Committees. We also had a number of informal meetings with the Northern  Ireland Affairs Committee, and we are grateful to all those who assisted us.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee had regular discussions with the First  Minister and deputy First Minister and the Secretary of State. Perhaps those  meetings were not frequent or long enough for some Committee members, but they  were always cordial and constructive, if not always illuminating. Initially,  the Secretary of State questioned why the Committee should involve itself in  the financial implications of devolution and appeared to resist its interest.  However, the Committee asserted its undoubted authority in such matters.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Similarly, the Committee insisted on seeing the seven key  documents that are considered to underpin the arrangements for devolution.  Members can find those documents in appendix 4 to the report. It is true to say  that the NIO took its time in releasing those documents, some of which were  found to be defective. The majority of the papers continue to be subject to  review and revision.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee is also frustrated that it has yet to see the  paper commissioned from John Larkin QC, as well as the First Minister and  deputy First Minister&rsquo;s response to it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Pages 2 to 12 of the report deal with a number of key  matters, including the financial implications of devolution; the role of the  Attorney General; the arrangements for the appointment, and removal, of  judicial office holders; North/South policing and justice agreements; parading;  the Public Prosecution Service; and the Justice Minister&rsquo;s position in the  Northern Ireland Executive.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is also an executive summary on page 1 of the report  which contains five conclusions. First, that there is merit in &pound;1&middot;328 billion  being ring-fenced for policing and justice services within the Northern Ireland  Executive&rsquo;s overall budget for 2010-11.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, in the interests of the good and proper  regulation of the way in which the Assembly conducts its business, it is  important to have an early resolution of matters relating to the role of the  Attorney General.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Thirdly, it will be necessary to have appropriate  arrangements in place to enable the Assembly to fulfil its scrutiny role on  prosecutorial policy, spending and administration in the Public Prosecution  Service.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Fourthly, the independence of the Public Prosecution  Service (PPS) should be maintained, and the accountability of the PPS should be  examined by the justice Committee, once it is established.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, subject to their compliance with all appropriate  policing and justice legislation, the procedures and protocols between the  Justice Minister, the justice Committee and the Department and its agencies  should be the same as those that apply to other Ministers in the Northern  Ireland Executive.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will elaborate on each of those conclusions in turn.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The &pound;1&middot;328 billion does not include the additional  financial package, which is considered to be some &pound;800 million in the current  comprehensive spending review (CSR) period and beyond. The Northern Ireland  Office will retain &pound;26 million to cover its own costs in 2010-11.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The additional financial package was the result of detailed  financial negotiations, which were very much informed by the work of the  Committee. The importance of that work has long been acknowledged, not least by  the First Minister and the deputy First Minister. The details of the package  were first published in a letter from the Prime Minister on 21 October 2009. A  second letter from the Prime Minister, also dated 21 October 2009, was provided  to the Committee in confidence. That letter provides clarification on a number  of points. The Committee subsequently sought and received permission to publish  the second letter, which it has done for the first time in the report. Both  letters can be found in appendix 3.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On 10 November 2009, the First Minister and the deputy First  Minister appeared before the Committee to discuss the correspondence from the  Prime Minister. At that meeting, they declared that they regarded the  additional financial package as acceptable.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Details of the distribution of the &pound;1&middot;328 billion across  the headquarters functions of the Department of Justice, and of the sums to be  made available to the range of executive NDPBs and executive agencies, can be  found on page 355 of volume 1 of the report.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is no denying that, in the short term, more work needs  to be done urgently, especially on the role of the Attorney General.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee expects to see John Larkin&rsquo;s paper, and the  OFMDFM response to it, in the coming days. That may pave the way for us to give  some further direction to the Committee on Procedures.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">12.00 noon</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I understand that the First Minister and the deputy First  Minister will appear before the Assembly and Executive Review Committee again  before the end of March. That meeting may give us an opportunity to resolve the  Attorney General&rsquo;s role and other outstanding issues, such as how the Public  Prosecution Service (PPS) will be properly scrutinised. The Committee  recognises that the Assembly, and politicians generally, should not interfere  in individual cases. However, the PPS is funded from public moneys and,  therefore, should be subject to proper scrutiny by the Assembly. The Committee  believes that the independence of the PPS should be maintained but that its  accountability should be examined in more detail after devolution.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The report deals with a number of other matters, which I  will touch on briefly. I want to draw Members&rsquo; attention to the fact that the  Northern Ireland Act 2009 provides for the initial arrange&shy;ments for the  appointment and removal of judicial office holders. The arrangements are  subject to review by the Assembly by May 2012. Although the Committee discussed  the relationships between SOCA and the security services and between the  Minister and the Assembly on a number of occasions, no consensus was reached on  what those relationships should be. Similarly, although it considered the  matter, the Committee did not reach consensus on the requirement for a justice  sector of the North/South Ministerial Council.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee had originally planned to address what  consideration, if any, it wished to give to the Ashdown report on parading.  Indeed, Lord Ashdown was invited to appear before the Committee but declined to  do so, and the Committee acknowledges that parading is addressed in section 2  of the Agreement at Hillsborough   Castle. The Committee  also discussed the fact that the First Minister and the deputy First Minister  have an advisory role to play in the appointment of the Police Ombudsman, but  no consensus was reached on any variation to the existing arrangements.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, I remind Members that the Committee&rsquo;s first report  on the arrangements for devolution identified a number of matters that a future  justice Committee might want to examine, the first of which relates to the  question of whether political parties should continue to appoint MLAs to the  Policing Board. The second issue relates to the future status of the Probation  Board, and the third and fourth issues relate to matters that the Northern  Ireland Law Commission and the Northern Ireland Legal Services Commission raised  in the Committee&rsquo;s initial report.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member should draw his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Assembly and Executive Review Committee</strong>: I hope that Members find  the Committee&rsquo;s second report informative and helpful in dealing with matters  today. I commend the report to the Assembly.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh r&aacute;iteas an  LeasCh&eacute;ad Aire, agus &eacute;ir&iacute;m chun tac&uacute; leis an r&uacute;n ar son Shinn F&eacute;in.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I declare an interest as a member of the Policing Board. I  fully support the motion that the two Ministers tabled jointly and welcome the  contribution that we heard from the deputy First Minister, Martin McGuinness.  Martin outlined some reasons why it is very important to complete the transfer  of policing and justice powers to here. Moreover, he set out what he thought  were some negative responses from other parties, particularly the Ulster  Unionist Party. However, that party will be able to elaborate later if it so  chooses.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is very important to welcome the point that we are at,  because it is clear that the transfer of policing and justice powers is a move  forward for the entire community. Even at this stage, I urge all parties and  all Members to vote for the motion, notwithstanding any reservations that they  may have, some of which may even be justifiable. The single most important  thing that the parties can do collectively today is to send out a solid and  unanimous message. However, it remains to be seen whether that will happen as  the day goes on.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I said at a public engagement this morning, I am not a  unionist, and I can have only a limited insight into the thinking of those  unionists with whom I engage. However, I and my colleagues who have been  members of the Policing Board for almost three years and other colleagues who  sit on district policing partnerships have been working day in and day out with  members of all the other parties. I defy any representative of any other  political party to decry any of the work that we, and many others, have been engaged  in over recent years as we have tried to tackle policing issues and to ensure  that the police work in partnership with local communities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Ultimately, all that we do is about making our communities  safer. I and my party colleagues Martina Anderson and Daith&iacute; McKay have no doubt  that there are people from every community, including Ulster Unionist Party  members, its MLAs and their supporters, who work every day of the week to  ensure that they not only engage on matters specifically related to policing  but on wider criminal justice issues. We all know, if we reflect honestly, that  there have been times in the recent past when families have come out of the  courts crying their eyes out about the way in which they have been unfairly  treated. They have been hurt by the lack of criminal convictions or  inappropriate sentences for heinous killings and other crimes in our community.  I urge the Ulster Unionist Party, even now, whatever its reservations, to come  on board positively and work with the rest of us to iron out the difficulties  that it believes exist.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The UUP knows that the vast majority of people whom it  represents want the transfer of policing and justice powers, and, equally  importantly, they want the parties to work together under a collective mandate  to resolve those issues and get on with the other important things that matter  to the community.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  I am sorry; I will not give way. I have listened to the Member in recent days,  and although I may feel his pain, I do not want to contribute to it by giving  him another shovel. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  The Member may be vacuous on his own time, but not on mine.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Our communities are looking forward to a fresh opportunity  to take part in an informed debate on how the complex issues of policing and  criminal justice can be brought to a forum like this under the tutelage of a locally  elected Minister who will engage with local communities and be accountable to  them, as opposed to under the tutelage of a direct rule Minister. I look  forward to a positive vote today so that the communities that we collectively  represent will have a new opportunity to engage on the important criminal  justice issues. Let us talk about the revolving-door system in the Magistrate&rsquo;s  Court and the failure of the Public Prosecution Service to properly prosecute  cases on behalf of victims and their families. I urge all parties to be  positive and constructive and to take the opportunity that is before us today.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member must bring his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I am grateful for the opportunity to participate in the debate on behalf of the  Ulster Unionist Party. I declare an interest as a member of the Assembly and  Executive Review Committee. I add my tribute to the Chairperson of the  Committee, the other members of the Committee and the Committee Clerk and his  staff for all their hard work.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The key decisions of the Assembly and Executive Review  Committee, it might be fairly and accurately said, took place elsewhere. It is  clear that although the issue of policing and justice ought to have been dealt  with in this House and at Stormont, it was instead, along with other issues  such as the Irish language, the on-the-runs and the removal of the Army from  Northern Ireland by October 2010, dealt with at Hillsborough. In that coalition  of loathing, that political carve-up &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Spratt</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I will give up &mdash; give way. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Spratt</strong>:  Will the Member inform the House when it was that the Assembly and Executive  Review Committee discussed the removal of the Army, or when it was discussed in  any other place?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  All I can say to the honourable Member is, wait and see. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  I want to make it absolutely clear, and I comprehensively reject the earlier  remarks and accusation levelled by the deputy First Minister when he opened the  debate, that the Ulster Unionist Party is not opposed to the devolution of  policing and justice in principle. We place that firmly on record. The Ulster  Unionist Party is not opposed to power sharing. It is thanks to the Ulster  Unionist Party in large measure that the deputy First Minister and others,  including the First Minister, enjoy their positions today.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Ulster Unionist Party has always taken the hard  decisions. It has always taken the right decisions for the right reasons and at  the right time. We will continue to do so today. It was not an Ulster Unionist  Party Member who said that policing and justice would never happen in our  political lifetime. It was not an Ulster Unionist Party Member who said that it  would not happen in the lifetime of this Assembly. There are people missing  from the DUP Benches. Perhaps some of them are having grave doubts. Perhaps  some of them are the &ldquo;abominable no men&rdquo;, as they were described, or perhaps  they are just incredible snowmen. However, we shall see whether their  principled opposition will melt away in the early spring sun.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I now come to those who have waxed loud about being the  principled opposition in this House: the Alliance Party, the self-proclaimed  defenders of the ordinary people. When I was a wee lad, my mother used to talk  about a man &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. Continue.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  My mother used to talk about a man who operated a stall in Smithfield market: Joseph Kavanagh. His  slogan was &ldquo;I buy anything&rdquo;. David Ford is now the Joseph Kavanagh of Northern Ireland  politics. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span> It seems that there is no cause  too great, no issue too important and no core belief so vital that cannot be  sacrificed for political expediency. The Alliance Party should be ashamed of  itself. It is now an article of ridicule all over Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">From the &ldquo;I buy anything&rdquo; man, I move to the &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do  anything&rdquo; man, Shaun Woodward, our esteemed Secretary of State; he of  Sainsburys fame &mdash; and I can kiss goodbye to my Nectar points this week. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span> The Secretary of State, in my view, has behaved  disgracefully, particularly over recent days. His attempts to bully, bribe and  blackmail this party have abused the high political office that he holds. He  should pack his bags well in advance of the forthcoming general election.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That brings me neatly to another person, the deputy First  Minister. Recently, we had the long-awaited announcement of the publication of  the cohesion, sharing and integration (CSI) strategy.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member has an extra minute in which to speak.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  Thank you, Mr Speaker, I am very grateful.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That strategy is now on its way. We, as a party, got a  taster of that yesterday in the deputy First Minister&rsquo;s office: the way ahead,  a shared future. We wanted to discuss the way forward, and instead we were  shown the way out. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span> The mask slipped, and  it was not make-over Martin, it was not the Martin of the Ard-Fheis, the  autocue, and the designer set of the RDS Dublin. It was more like the Martin  from the Bogside. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span> I am glad that this  party is not in the Lobbies with that man today.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The problem is not with policing and justice. The problem  is that the Executive are not being properly run. They are being run for the  two and the few, and not for the many. Therefore, we cannot endorse the motion.  We need to address seriously the issues that confront the Assembly and our  people; the issues of economy and jobs and education and health.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I ask the Member to draw his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  The Ulster Unionist Party is right when it stands back and holds back its  position today. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Ritchie</strong>:  The motion before us is very important. It will set in motion the procedure  that will result in the transfer of policing and justice responsibilities from Westminster to Stormont  next month. Therefore, the SDLP very much welcomes the motion. Indeed, we  believe that it should have happened long ago.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">What has made today possible is not the recent scrambling  at Hillsborough but 10 years of dedicated policing and justice reform, which  was spearheaded by people such as Chris Patten, Nuala O&rsquo;Loan, Alex Attwood, the  thousands who applied to, and the hundreds who joined, the new PSNI, and so  many others. We will vote for it today. The devolution of policing and justice  powers should never have brought the collapse of our devolved institutions so  close a few weeks ago, and it should not be allowed to destabilise us now.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The air of crisis that has surrounded policing and justice  is the result of people not being honest about it. That began three years ago,  when Sinn F&eacute;in claimed that it had secured the DUP&rsquo;s agreement to the  devolution of policing and justice powers in the St Andrews Agreement. Sinn  F&eacute;in asserted that claim repeatedly, and, as time passed, it accused the DUP of  being in breach of the St Andrews Agreement. That situation was compounded by  the silence of both Governments, who allowed Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s inaccurate version of  events to go unchallenged. Although I acknowledge the desire of the two  Governments to deliver progress, they have not distinguished themselves on the  issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">More recently, we have had all the dissembling and  gerrymandering around the appointment of a Justice Minister. A DUP concern  about the possibility of a Sinn F&eacute;in Justice Minister has become a DUP veto on  any nationalist Minister who has Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s blessing. That situation continues  despite the fact that the established system for appointing Ministers states  that the next ministerial position could go to nationalists.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>A Member</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  No; I will not be giving way.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the coming weeks, we will witness Sinn F&eacute;in trying to  engineer a situation in which it appears to vote for Alban Maginness in the  Chamber despite having designed a process that guarantees that he cannot be  appointed. We will also see a display of phoney reluctance from others who have  no democratic right to the position. To cap it all, the DUP will lecture us  that a cross-community vote in the Assembly is the finest form of democracy or  that the involvement of five parties is more democratic than four. Once again,  carve-up politics is being disguised as inclusive government.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>A Member</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  No, I will not.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in and their cheerleaders heralded the  Hillsborough arrangement as yet another historic deal. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  Let me nail the latest spin. A vote for the transfer of policing and justice  powers is not an endorsement of the Hillsborough package. Martin McGuinness has  been making that claim all week, but he is wrong. The SDLP supports the  devolution of policing and justice powers, but we think that aspects of the  Hillsborough arrangement are unclear, uncertain and unhelpful. The Hillsborough  arrangement is based on a distortion of democracy, and it could turn the clock  back on parading. It is secretive while pretending to be open, and it is a  carve-up that pretends to be inclusive.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Members need only look at the elements of the Hillsborough  arrangement, which include a date for the devolution of policing and justice  powers, which, for purely electoral reasons, is applicable only if the DUP is  supported by the party that it has excluded and abused for years. There is a  parading working group, to which the SDLP and the UUP need not apply. Elected  Ministers are not allowed to see any papers, but Sinn F&eacute;in is happy to share  them with the Orange Order. The Executive function and delivery working group  has four-party involvement, but, after six meetings, it is going nowhere fast.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a St Andrews unfinished business working group and  an Executive backlog working group, which is chaired by the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in  but struggles to make progress. At the Executive, I asked for a copy of the  agreed cohesion, sharing and integration strategy, but I was told that I cannot  have it. Although David Ford made agreement to the CSI strategy the fig leaf  that enabled him to claim the nomination for Justice Minister, he has not seen  &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I ask the Member to bring her remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  David Ford has not seen the CSI strategy either. At least that is what I was  told at the Executive.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP supports the devolution of policing and justice  powers today, just as we always have.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. I must insist that the Member brings her remarks to a close. Time is up.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  We do that, without equivocation, for the greater good of our community. We  need the devolution of policing and justice powers, because we need to stand  with the many families who have been let down by the Public Prosecution Service  and the many who live in fear of crime. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: <span class="Italic">[Interruption.] </span>As I rise to support the motion, I note the  enormous wave of support that is either side of me.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is no doubt that the devolution of justice powers is  the last challenge that we face as an Assembly. The issue brought down the  institutions of this place in 1972, it was too difficult to deal with in 1998,  and agreeing to it will be a sign that we can start to make progress at this  stage. In fact, it will be the biggest change since 1998 in the devolution arrangements  in any of the three devolved nations.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Members need to listen to the community, particularly those  who are involved in the justice system, about the importance of getting this  devolution and to show that we can deliver in the Assembly for all our people.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I start by thanking Jimmy Spratt for his report. I also  thank the members of the Assembly and Executive Review Committee for their  work. I fear that their detailed report will not get the attention that it  probably deserves, given the way in which it has been introduced. Mr Spratt  certainly made some interesting points, particularly when he talked about the  role of the Attorney General and the functions of the Public Prosecution  Service, which will need to be addressed in coming weeks.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I believe that we need the devolution of justice powers for  three key reasons. First, it is part of cementing the peace process. I speak as  an MLA for South Antrim, a year after the  shootings at Massereene Barracks when two soldiers were murdered and a couple  of months after the car bomb that so seriously injured Peadar Heffron. If we  need any examples in this society of the necessity of getting the devolution of  justice powers under way, we have only to look at what those who oppose it seek  to do.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, if we get devolution of justice powers, it will  demonstrate that this institution and these institutions as a whole are capable  of taking responsibility for difficult decisions. It will also demonstrate that  the sort of ya-boo politics that we have seen so much of over the past three  years are at an end.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Thirdly, there is clearly a need to have joined-up  government and to have the institutions function together correctly. This  morning, I sponsored an event in the Long Gallery for the Northern Ireland  Association of Social Workers. I made the point that an interplay exists  between the criminal justice system and people who have mental health and  personality disorder issues. Those issues are simply not dealt with unless  Ministers who sit together round the same Executive Table address them. I note  that my professional colleague across the way is at least nodding his head in  agreement.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have no doubt that confidence in the devolution of  justice powers exists in this community. The overwhelming results of opinion  polls and the kind of conversations that we all have show that although there  may not be a demand for the devolution of justice powers as such, there is an  absolute demand that these institutions take responsibility for the issues that  are in the remit of the future Department of Justice. That is the case even if  the questions that are asked in the polls are somewhat loaded. That absolute  demand is why we need the devolution of justice powers. We need those powers to  be devolved not because people necessarily want institutional change but  because there is a vital necessity to see practical change and to see  devolution delivering in all the areas that it can, including justice.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I listened with modest interest to Mr Kennedy&rsquo;s rant. I  noticed that he managed to spend most of his time giving general abuse. He was  then followed by Ms Ritchie, who managed to heap an equivalent amount of abuse  on people. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span> That is OK, however,  because I can deal with it. However, when we are discussing an issue that is as  serious as this, the fact that the two parties on either side of me degenerate  into personal abuse and do not consider the issues seriously shows that some  people have to grow up even if others have started to move forward.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Those who did not engage at Hillsborough when they were  given the opportunity and those who did not engage before that when we invited  them to engage on policies are the people who fail to recognise that, on the  issue of a shared future, for example, we never expected to see a policy paper.  However, we asked for and we got progress and engagement from the First  Minister and the deputy First Minister. That never happened when the Ulster  Unionists and the SDLP were in charge. That is a measure of movement forward  that shows some degree of happening.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When we get to the sort of remarks that we heard this  morning from the Ulster Unionist Minister about what would happen if the Army  had to be brought in &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I ask the Member to bring his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: The  UUP is now showing that everyone else is out of step except it and Jim  Allister. The Alliance Party supports the motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>:  I am a member of the Northern Ireland Policing Board.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Members driving to the Assembly today probably heard the  interview on BBC radio of the widow of Stephen Carroll, the murdered police  officer. I do not think that anyone could have not been moved by her strong  words, the words of an Ulsterwoman crying on behalf of Ulstermen and women: get  on with it, do your job, do what we have elected you to do, respond to the  needs of this community, and listen to the people.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I would not want anyone else in the House to be in the  unenviable position of one Member during that radio discussion, because he had  to respond to a real person. Not a journalist&rsquo;s putdown, but the real words of  a widow who could take a very different approach to life. She said: get on with  it for the memory of my husband and the memory of ordinary Ulstermen and  Ulsterwomen. That is a challenge to every man and woman in the House to pick up  the gauntlet, take the House forward and rule this divided country with a bit  of energy and hope, and try to bring a bit of harmony to this place. Is this  House listening to the crying words of men and women outside the Chamber, or  are we in wrecking mode? That is the answer that Ulster awaits today.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I carefully chose my place in the Chamber today. I stand  beside a man who was shot by the IRA, and behind a man who was a gallant member  of the Royal Ulster Constabulary. That tells its own story about the strength  of feeling in this party and this House to take this land forward. I do not  like the outside interference that has been put upon the Ulster Unionist Party.  No one likes that, but it does not take away from our duty and our  responsibilities to take the difficult decisions and to do what is right. It is  taking those difficult decisions that will make this House noble, instead of a  House of ridicule.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Donaldson</strong>:  What message does the Member think that the dissident IRA bombers who exploded  a bomb outside Newry courthouse would have for the House today? Would they be  supporting the devolution of policing and justice or opposing it? Did they  explode that bomb to frighten some people out of taking the right decision?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member has a minute added to his time.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>:  Thank you, Mr Speaker.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that Members take the right decision, not because of  outside interference, and are not scared away. I hope that they do the right  thing because of the people whom we all represent. To come into this House, we  made a manifesto pledge that there would not be a Sinn F&eacute;in Minister of  policing and justice precisely because of some of the fears of some of my  colleagues and some of the things that have happened in our land. On that  point, we can say that we have delivered; it is mission accomplished. Yes, we  have come to an agreement, and, yes, the compromise is that we do not take that  post either.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Taking those tough decisions will make this House noble  rather than a House of ridicule. However, some want it to continue to be the  place of ridicule, and we should not rise to the scare tactics of suggesting  that Sinn F&eacute;in will not support operational decisions. The very people who say  that have themselves failed to support operational decisions by the police. I  just wish that some of those people would lead by example.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a default; the position that we have negotiated  will not go back to a grab-all after 2012 &mdash; a safeguard that this party put in  place for unionism that was not there in 2003 or 2005. Why was the UUP willing  then, but not willing now?</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">12.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There will be some issues raised about national security,  which is a matter that is important to me and other Members of this House. Let  us address the confusion. Mr Attwood has said publicly that Northern Ireland is not like any other part of  the UK.  The fact is that it is the same as the rest of the United Kingdom. National security  is an issue, and it is embedded here in the same way as it is in the north of England, Scotland  and London. We  have put in place another reassurance and safeguard because we are not a place  apart. We are a place within the Union.  Therefore, we should and must go forward today with confidence.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Business Committee has arranged to meet immediately upon the lunchtime  suspension. I propose, therefore, by leave of the Assembly, to suspend the  sitting until 2.00 pm, when the next Member to speak will be Martina Anderson.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The sitting was suspended at 12.31 pm.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic" style="page-break-before:always;">On resuming (Mr  Speaker in the Chair) &mdash;</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Anderson</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. &Eacute;ir&iacute;m chun taca&iacute;ocht a thabhairt don  r&uacute;n. I support the motion and declare an interest as a member of the Policing  Board. I also declare that I am, like Martin McGuinness, a very proud resident  of the Bogside.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I return to what Members were talking about before lunch:  no matter how much some parties in the Chamber try to frustrate the process,  the transfer of policing and justice powers away from London and into the hands of locally elected  politicians is without doubt what the people want. They are demanding a justice  system that will deliver for all people here. Those of us who work closely with  our communities &mdash; that applies to many in the Chamber &mdash; know the extent of the  anger at the revolving-door justice system that allows criminals back on to the  streets, sometimes hours after being arrested. We know of people&rsquo;s sheer  heartbreak when killers are sentenced to a few years&rsquo; imprisonment for their  crimes. I am sure that Members have worked with families, as I have done in  Derry, who have been absolutely devastated by the lenient sentences handed down  to the people responsible for the death of their loved ones. People such as  Eugenia Doherty, who has allowed me to refer to her, whose son Ciaran died in a  car crash in 2008. The man convicted of causing 17-year-old Ciaran&rsquo;s death was  sentenced to just two years in prison. I and, I am sure, many others have seen  the heartbreak and pain endured by such families.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There has been no local Minister or locally designated  framework to which we can refer those families for assistance in arriving at  some kind of understanding of the situation. Seeing their loved ones&rsquo; killers  given such lenient sentences only compounds people&rsquo;s pain. Such cases go to the  heart of the need to transfer policing and justice powers and to build a  justice system that is absolutely fit for purpose. I have dealt with cases in  which there has been a fundamental breakdown of the justice system, from the  PSNI through to the PPS and the courts. The motion provides us with an  opportunity to shape and reconstruct the system, so that justice and the needs  of victims are at the heart of the process. UUP Members say that the machinery  of justice is broken, but they do not want to take on the responsibility of  fixing it. Of course the task ahead is massive and difficult, but we in Sinn  F&eacute;in have never been afraid of hard work.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In many ways, this is day one for the new justice system.  The challenge that we all face now is to build the kind of justice system that  the people demand and deserve. For one, I look forward to playing my part. As a  member of the Policing Board&rsquo;s human rights and professional standards  committee, I appreciate the opportunity to shine a light into every corner of  policing in order to safeguard citizens&rsquo; rights, including, where necessary,  those of police officers. That is the diligence and accountability that we now  intend to apply to the whole justice system.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Concerns have, of course, been raised regarding the NIO&rsquo;s  draft protocols on how existing policing arrangements will operate in the new  Department of Justice, but the role, responsibility and status of the Policing  Board are set in legislation and will not be adversely affected by the transfer  of policing and justice powers. Furthermore, members of the Policing Board were  informed on Thursday that all those protocols are works in progress and are  subject to change.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to be clear: MI5 should have no role whatsoever in Ireland. As  someone from a community that has suffered absolutely immensely at the hands of  an oppressive state, I know the poisonous and malignant influence of that  organisation in my country only too well. It is for that very reason that Sinn  F&eacute;in firewalls civic policing from the toxic influence of MI5. That organisation  should have no role in our country or in civic policing. Some parties criticise  us, yet they want to bring MI5 back into the heart of the process and make it a  fundamental part of policing in our community. We are building a system with  maximum accountability, transparency and disclosure of all aspects of policing  and justice.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member should draw her remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Anderson</strong>:  It is about so much more than politics; it is about communities, families and  people. It is about all the people in the North, and they want the kind of  justice system that I believe we can put in place.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Anderson</strong>:  It is up to everyone in the Chamber to vote in favour of the motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  It is a pleasure to speak to this motion. Like my party, I have long been in  favour of the devolution of policing and justice powers to this institution.  There is a catalogue of reasons why we have wanted it, not least the historical  attachment that unionists have had to having policing powers in our own  Parliament. In fact, as David Ford indicated, the 1972 Parliament collapsed as  a result of those very powers being taken away from unionists in this Building.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Everyone in my party is a long-standing devolutionist. Long  before others came up with fanciful ideas about how to run this place, my party  stood alone and fought for the maximum amount of sensible devolution to Northern Ireland,  so we want more powers here, not fewer. In addition, we have always wanted to  make a difference. Imperfect as things have been, in the past three years, we  have tried to make a difference and, whether in policing and justice, social  policy or economic policy, we will continue striving to make a difference in  this country.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We wanted powers to be devolved on the basis of sound and  solid conditions being met, principal among which was that there should not be  a Sinn F&eacute;in Justice Minister. Mr Speaker, that is not going to be the case;  there will be no Sinn F&eacute;in Justice Minister now or in the future. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I hear catcalls from Members to my right, so this is an opportune moment to  remind those individuals about their position on the devolution of policing and  justice powers. This morning, I heard on the radio Reg Empey talking last  night. He said, &ldquo;Our history is our strength&rdquo;. On this issue, their history is  their weakness, because they stand exposed as the hypocrites that they are. The  Ulster Unionist Party was prepared and willing to devolve policing and justice  powers in 2005, at the midpoint of the last Assembly&rsquo;s mandate. Today, they are  not so sure about what, in their eyes, was the right and proper thing to do  five years ago in 2005.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hilditch</strong>:  Was that to enable them to secure the position for Sinn F&eacute;in? <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  The Member made a very good point: the Ulster Unionist Party&rsquo;s decision in 2003  to devolve powers in 2005 showed its utter short-sightedness. As everybody  knows, at that time, powers would have been devolved to two Ministers and, at  that time, Sinn F&eacute;in was overtaking the SDLP as the largest nationalist party,  so, in 2005, Sinn F&eacute;in and not the SDLP would have occupied one of the justice  positions. That was also a time when Sinn F&eacute;in was allied to an army that was  armed and involved in criminality and terrorism on the streets of Northern Ireland.  That shows the short-sightedness &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker. I remind the House that Sinn F&eacute;in is a  political party, so the Member should curb his remarks. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. I remind Members that they should temper their remarks and respect the  House&rsquo;s dignity and its business.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I am happy to point out that, as a result of the Democratic Unionist Party&rsquo;s  resolute actions, the republican movement has advanced to the point at which  those arms have been abandoned and its terrorist and criminal past is behind  it. The Ulster Unionist Party, however, was prepared not only to sit in  government with Sinn F&eacute;in while all that behaviour was going on but to devolve  policing and justice powers to it. Its members stand exposed as the hypocrites  that they are. Although we would like to have had their support for the  devolution of policing and justice powers, when it became patently obvious that  they had no intention of doing what they have long stood in favour of doing, it  was utterly apparent to everybody that we were dealing not with a dysfunctional  Executive but with a dysfunctional Ulster Unionist Party. Opinion poll after  opinion poll shows that the vast majority of people in Northern Ireland  support the devolution of policing and justice powers. Indeed, in quiet corners  of this Building, its Members tell us that they want those powers to be  devolved to the Assembly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In his opening remarks, Mr Kennedy talked about everything  but policing and justice. There was no objection at all to the substantive  point before us today: the devolution of policing and justice. It shows that  what his party is doing today is for purely party political reasons. Its  opposition is entirely manufactured and is not consistent with its historical  position.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  No, I will not give way. The Member will have time to answer the accusations  and valid criticisms that I have thrown at him. The Ulster Unionist Party may  want to tell the British Secretary of State to butt out of the affairs of Northern Ireland, and it may want to tell its  Tory paymasters to get stuffed, but it will not tell the people of Northern Ireland  that they cannot make progress. The DUP, and the DUP alone, offers the people  of Northern Ireland  the opportunity to make progress and to move forward, and that is what I am  backing today.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I call Alan McFarland.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  Captain McFarland. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McFarland</strong>:  Major, please. I will start by declaring my membership of the Assembly and  Executive Review Committee and by paying tribute to the Chairperson, the Clerk  and the staff for the outstanding work that they have done with us over the  past few years.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">For five years up until 2006, I served on the Policing  Board with Alex Attwood, Sammy Wilson, Ian Junior and Fred Cobain, constructing  the outstanding, modern Police Service that we have today. During 2006, I  served on the Preparation for Government Committee, and we nursed the fledgling  negotiations between the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in around the table for the first time.  However, we were not allowed to refer to them as negotiations. The DUP insisted  that it was a scoping exercise, and we got into the most awful trouble every  time we used the word &ldquo;negotiations&rdquo;. Indeed, I recall a major row between  Willie McCrea and Martin McGuinness, when Willie took unkindly to a lecture  from Martin McGuinness, and it is interesting that, 24 hours ago, Martin was  still running around in a state of pompous lecturing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">For the past three years, I have served with the Assembly  and Executive Review Committee, and in front of Members today is the latest of  our three extremely fat tomes on policing and justice. I am telling everyone  that, because I spent the past eight years of my life developing policing and  justice so that it can be devolved here; therefore, there is no doubt that my  party and I wish to see it devolved here. We need local legislation so that  anyone who is found guilty of attacking an elderly person in their home,  socialising at night at the Odyssey with a six-inch Bowie knife on their hip,  annoying neighbours with antisocial behaviour or attacking the fire, police or  ambulance services should receive a sentence that will act as a meaningful  deterrent rather than the sort of sentences that they get at present. We need  that legislation to be allowed to be developed here. Why then does the Ulster  Unionist Party object to the motion?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have been trying to fix a broken Executive and trying to  persuade the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in to adopt a four-party coalition, which is what  it is supposed to be, and a consensus in government, which is surely what we  all strive for here. Surely, that is not too much to ask for. However, despite  all the fine, inclusive words over the past month, we have encountered again  the blockage that has been with us since 2007. The Executive are a two-party  junta. Generalissimo Robinson and Generalissimo McGuinness have their parties  ruthlessly drive issues through the Executive and Committees. Where is the  equality and listening to others&rsquo; views in all that?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We had 154 days of chaos in the halted Executive, and it is  a bit rich for Martin McGuinness to lecture us on vetoes as he did earlier. The  Sinn F&eacute;in Executive Minister is on an ideological crusade, destroying grammar  schools and prep schools against the wishes of all the other parties in the  Assembly. Our efforts at Hillsborough and over the past week to fix the  dysfunctional Executive have been blocked by the junta once again.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Ulster Unionist Party would like to see policing and  justice devolved to the Assembly, but we object to the corruption of the  democratic process that sees Lord Ford gerrymandered into the role of Justice  Minister.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ford</strong>: On  a point of order, Mr Speaker. I understand that, on occasions, you have ruled  that Members should be referred to by their correct name. I know that it  pleases Mr McFarland to make that cheap, snide remark, but it is becoming a bit  boring. If he wishes to refer to me, may I ask that he addresses me properly?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. I have said in the House on several occasions that Members should be  referred to by their proper name, and that also applies to parties.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McFarland</strong>:  It is interesting that some people react faster than others to the cut and  thrust of politics. We also believe that it makes no sense and, in fact, is  dangerous to devolve policing and justice to this cracked and broken two-party  junta of an Executive. My party and I will not support the motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  For too long, policing and justice has been a stumbling block. I hope that the  devolution of policing and justice will become a stepping stone to a more stable  society. I hope that lessons have been learned from the misuse of power, which  led to Stormont being prorogued 38 years ago. I remind Mr Ford that one of the  greatest misuses of power that led to the demise of Stormont was, of course,  Bloody Sunday.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP has a vision for a society coming out of the  Troubles that is at peace with itself and whose citizens are at peace with one  another. We envisage a society that has a system of justice that is just, fair,  compassionate, accessible and sensitive to the needs of all its people and is  practical and effective in meeting the needs of all in society. The transfer of  policing and justice is only the beginning; it is not the conclusion or  completion of devolution. It is a process of reinforcing and, at times,  rebuilding the confidence of ordinary people in the institutions of justice and  policing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That positive achievement could not have been realised had  it not been for the recreation of policing under Patten. The SDLP is proud to  take credit for the heavy lifting in that regard. Without the infrastructure of  policing, no society can properly afford security to its citizens, and without  fair policing and an acceptable police force we cannot have the rock on which  justice and policing can be firmly placed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Acceptable policing has provided the basis for the transfer  of policing and justice powers, but the issue of policing is not finished yet.  We want community policing. We believe that we are working towards that, and  that should be an objective of all the parties in the Assembly. It is our aim  and the aim, I hope, of other parties to achieve that. The SDLP seeks a justice  system that serves the needs of all the people and grants justice. We believe  that to be the paramount aim.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We envisage the creation of a charter of rights for victims  of crime; the establishment of a sentencing guidelines council; legislation on  knife crime; the Prisoner Ombudsman based on statute; and we want the Assembly  to work closely with the new Law Commission and its deliberations. On policy,  my party wants to see the implementation of the Criminal Justice Inspection  recommendations. We also want to see reform of the Prison Service and the  development of the prison estate. We want to see the building of a new women&rsquo;s  facility. We want to see the building of a new prison. We believe that it is  essential that a new policing college be built here.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My party seeks a review of the work of the Public  Prosecution Service. Last week&rsquo;s events highlight the deficiencies that exist  there. Above all, the Assembly must address that office&rsquo;s accountability to the  people of Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My party also wants to see a review of the criminal  injuries compensation scheme, which is unfair to victims of crime. We also want  to see the setting up of a criminal justice policy review forum and the reform  of legal aid. Without that, ordinary people will not have access to their  rights in the civil courts and will not receive justice. We want to see the  review of the monetary jurisdiction of County Courts and the High Court.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member will bring his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  Finally, there are many outstanding issues that need to be addressed,  particularly in relation to the intelligence service, North/South relationships  and so on.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  Those issues require ongoing work.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCartney</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Chomhairle. Ar dt&uacute;s, ba mhaith liom mo bhu&iacute;ochas  a ghabh&aacute;il leis an Ch&eacute;ad Aire agus leis an LeasCh&eacute;ad Aire as ucht an tuairisc  seo a chur os &aacute;r gcomhair inniu. Ba mhaith liom freisin mo bhu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il  le Cathaoirleach an Choiste, Jimmy Spratt, as an obair at&aacute; d&eacute;anta aige agus ag  foireann an Choiste.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the motion that has been tabled by the First  Minister and the deputy First Minister, and I commend the Assembly and  Executive Review Committee&rsquo;s second report. A resolution would set in motion  the legislative process for the transfer of justice and policing matters to the  Assembly; the establishment of a Justice Department and, in turn, a Justice  Minister; and all that flows from that. That is what people elected us to do,  and that is what this Assembly will achieve today. The Committee&rsquo;s report is an  important component of that. I want to take the opportunity to thank the Committee  Chairperson, Jimmy Spratt, for his work and the Clerk and his staff for their  contribution. Patience was required throughout the process; he showed  remarkable patience.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is understandable that many people who, perhaps, are  listening to the debate would believe that the issue concentrates solely on  policing. Nothing could be further from reality. As important as policing is,  it is only part of the process that leads to transfer and, indeed, its reality.  Other agencies that will be transferred include the Court Service, the Public  Prosecution Service, the Prison Service, the Prisoner Ombudsman, the Probation  Board, the forensic science laboratory, the Criminal Justice Inspection, the  Youth Justice Agency and the Legal Services Commission, which deals with legal  aid, as well as many others to boot. With that transfer comes all those  agencies&rsquo; budget lines. Indeed, it brings with it an ability to make changes  and to introduce new legislation. Going down that list of agencies, I believe  that I can say without contradiction that all of us have, in recent times,  dealt with them and found that doors were closed simply because they were not  within the Assembly&rsquo;s remit. With transfer, those agencies will come under the  auspices of the Justice Department and Justice Minister. Their work will be  open to scrutiny by the justice Committee. That is the Government&rsquo;s  responsibility. It is our responsibility as elected representatives and,  importantly, it is what the people who elected us want us to do.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Many people believe that the current criminal justice  system does not work for the benefit of the community. Transfer provides new  opportunities to change that. It will now be our responsibility to make the  criminal justice system work for the community&rsquo;s benefit.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Hillsborough agreement lists areas that the new  Department will address as an addendum to the Programme for Government. Under  the banner &ldquo;Equality of access to justice&rdquo;, they will include a sentencing  guidelines council; review of alternatives to prison custody; the power of the  Prisoner Ombudsman to be reviewed in the light of experience elsewhere; and  calls for a review of conditions of detention and management and oversight of  all prisons. I note that Alban Maginness cited a number of them. His party&rsquo;s lukewarm  reception to the Hillsborough agreement must be warming up.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Indeed, many people down through the years have said that  our current prison system requires major reform. Now is the time to fulfil  that, and we have the opportunity to do so now. For example, the Assembly  debated issues of prison policy on two separate occasions. The first occasion  was when the report of the Criminal Justice Inspection was debated, and the  second occasion was the debate on the Prisoner Ombudsman&rsquo;s report into the  death of Colin Bell when he was in Maghaberry prison. On both occasions, it was  noticeable that no represent&shy;atives of the Prison Service or the agencies that  were involved found it necessary to be at the Assembly to listen to the debate.  Indeed, many Members remarked on that. A marker was put down during those  debates about what should transpire as a result of the recommendations that  were made. Given that, however, none of those agencies contacted me, and I do  not know of any other Member who was contacted. That is a damning indictment of  ourselves.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The opportunity now exists, and we should not miss it.  Whenever events occur, such as deaths in custody, we all run to microphones and  say that this and that should not happen, yet we have no powers of scrutiny or  powers to ensure that any recommendations will be implemented. That opportunity  now exists. People who talk about the transfer should see it in its  completeness and should not narrow it down to one issue or to an issue of their  own reckoning. This is an opportunity to do the right thing for the people who  elected us to do the right thing.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Donaldson</strong>:  I welcome the opportunity to participate in the debate and to support the  devolution of policing and justice powers to this Assembly. We were reminded  that, in 1972, the then unionist Government decided to close the doors on  Stormont because they were losing those powers. I note that their successors in  the Ulster Unionist Party stated that they have no principled opposition to the  devolution of the powers. Therefore, I find it a little curious that they are  here today to vote against the devolution of the powers. Their history speaks  to them of the need to have these powers in a devolved Parliament and  government.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When we examine the case for devolution and see those who  support its happening now, we see that they include the Chief Constable of the  Police Service of Northern Ireland and the chairman of the Police Federation  for Northern Ireland.  Given all the difficulties that the Police Service and the RUC before it have  encountered, if those people can put their hands up and say that now is the  right time for devolution, who are we to second-guess them?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  Dr McCrea, who is a member of Mr Donaldson&rsquo;s party, said that he would vote  against the devolution of policing and justice powers. I wonder, therefore, how  many other members of his party will be voting for the devolution of policing  and justice powers.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member has an extra minute.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Donaldson</strong>:  Thank you, Mr Speaker, for the extra minute. The Member will be able to see  clearly that this party is united in its support for the devolution of policing  and justice powers. Let there be no doubt about that. The divisions in his  party&rsquo;s position are more evident in the Member&rsquo;s ranks than in ours. Has the  Member of Parliament for North Down, who is that party&rsquo;s single Member of  Parliament, endorsed the Ulster Unionist Party position? I doubt it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As the Member for North Antrim  said, Mrs Kate Carroll spoke on the radio this morning and said that despite  her hurt, pain and sense of loss, she felt that now was the right time for  politicians to move forward. Oh that we all had the courage of people such as  Kate Carroll, who can set behind them their difficulties and their personal  feelings and recognise that this is the right thing to do and that this is the  right time to do it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have not heard any coherent argument from the Ulster  Unionist Party as to why it opposes the devolution of the powers at this time.  The Ulster Unionist Party&rsquo;s deputy leader, Mr Kennedy, told us that it was  something to do with the Irish language. I have read the Hillsborough agreement  from back to front, and I cannot see any reference to the Irish language. He  then told us that it was something to do with the Army being withdrawn from Northern Ireland  in October this year. That is absolute nonsense. That matter was not even  discussed at Hillsborough; it was not even an issue at Hillsborough. It is just  something that he had to dream up as a fig leaf to cover his embarrassment for  opposing the devolution of policing and justice powers.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When people have to make things up and scare&shy;monger to  justify their position, it says a lot about the credibility of their position. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Donaldson</strong>:  I recently attended a church service in Newry, along with the deputy leader of  the Ulster Unionist Party, to commemorate police officers of the Newry  subdivision who had given their lives in defence of our freedom and to protect  the entire community. Some of them were murdered in the mortar attack on Newry  police station 25 years ago. Afterwards, I spoke to the families of those  police officers, and they told me that it is time to move on. However, I  respect that there are others who do not share that view. I respect their  position and the integrity of that position, because it is principled  opposition; it is not just about timing.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Us.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Donaldson</strong>:  It does not include you, the Member for Lagan Valley,  because your opposition is not principled. It is all to do with party politics,  not principle. I can respect people who oppose the devolution &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. Members must make their remarks through the Chair.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Donaldson</strong>:  I can respect people who have a principled opposition to the devolution of  policing and justice powers, but I do not respect those who seek to play games  with the issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A year ago, the House stood in unity when the murderers  were out on the streets murdering two soldiers and Constable Stephen Carroll,  whose widow spoke on this subject this morning. The House was united in sending  them a very clear message that they will not have their way. What is it that  they are trying to do? They are trying to destroy the Assembly and the  political progress that we have made. Why did they explode that bomb outside  Newry courthouse? Why choose a courthouse? It was chosen because it is  symbolic. What was the message? The message was that they wanted the devolution  of policing and justice to be stopped. It saddens me that today the House is  not united in sending them a very clear message, which is that we intend to  press ahead. We will not allow the bombers and gunmen to have their way.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Even at this late moment, I wish only that those in the  Ulster Unionist Party would reflect on their position. Whatever their  reservations about timing, frankly, that is not good enough. It is time for us  to unite again and send a clear message to the terrorists out there who seek to  undermine the progress that we are making &mdash; those who want to drag us back to  the dark days of the past. We should send them a united message, and I hope  that, even yet, the Ulster Unionists will see sense and make the right  decision, give principled leadership and join us in the lobbies to support the  motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. This is a very big day for the  Assembly and for our communities. Unfortunately, I missed some of the debate  this morning, but I am picking up that it is a very emotional day for people.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I would like to touch on some of the issues that we have  encountered in our community concerning the fact that a lot of constituents see  all the agencies as one. The example that I will use is of multi-agency  meetings that include the PSNI, the council, residents, community groups,  statutory bodies, and so on. More often that not, when serial offenders in our  community appear in front of the courts, the PSNI object to bail, yet they are  granted bail. Those are the sorts of linkages that I am talking about. People  need to feel that local people are making all of the institutions accountable.  That is very important. Massive strides have been made, particularly on policing,  over the last while. Massive strides have even been made on engagement with  different statutory bodies. However, there are sometimes blatant and obvious  gaps between them all. Today will be the start of a process that will ensure  that people can see that there will be seamless links.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Absolutely nothing will be sorted out in one day. Other  Members have said that this is the start of a change. It is the first day of  real change and of local power being in the hands of local politicians, most of  whom enjoy a substantial mandate. For example, there have been recent cases in  my community, such as the murder of Thomas Devlin and Harry Holland. There are  many others that do not get the same type of publicity, for obvious reasons.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is also a big day for the many families who have sought  and been denied justice. It is not a day for party political point scoring.  There have been many difficulties across the House, in my community and in the  communities of other Members about historical legacies and what those will mean  for people. Many people have suffered much pain.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Leadership starts in this House, and, as Members, we will  go back to our constituencies to do the work that we were elected to do, such  as that which is done at the multi-agency meeting that I described earlier.  Elected representatives, residents, the PSNI and other statutory bodies are  trying to bring an end to criminality in their communities by working with each  other. When policing and justice is devolved, the people who are trying to  eradicate really bad aspects of antisocial behaviour will know that one of the  biggest gaps has been plugged. Indeed, they will know that there will be local  accountability, and that is very important.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The pain that we all share, regardless of which side of the  House we sit on, will not end today. In fact, if we are being totally honest,  the people who have lost someone at the hands of the police and the families of  policemen who have been lost are the very people who have told us all to wise  up and to get on with it. People who are living with the legacy of the  conflict, whatever end of the community they come from, are telling us to wise  up and get on with it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have also heard that message from residents and  constituents whose quality of life is, at times, zilch. They find it hard to  tackle and to bear the levels of criminality that they face. All agencies,  communities and stakeholders are trying to work together to make a real  difference to people&rsquo;s lives, and today is a big day for them. For that and  many other reasons, I support the motion. Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: In  2007, the unionist electorate endorsed the Democratic Unionist Party. They  endorsed the manifesto on which we stood, which was to bring strong and  accountable devolution to Northern    Ireland. That manifesto included our desire  for responsibility for policing and justice to be returned to the hands of  Stormont.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We made it clear that we wanted two conditions for the  devolution of policing and justice: we wanted community confidence; and we  wanted to ensure that there would not be a Sinn F&eacute;in Justice Minister. As a  result of legislation that the House has passed already, we know that there  will not be a Sinn F&eacute;in Justice Minister; Sinn F&eacute;in will not nominate to the  post of Justice Minister. In addition, under the mechanism by which the Justice  Minister will be elected, cross-community support will be required. It is  important that a position such as that of policing and justice Minister, which  has sensitivities, can command the support of both communities and maximum  buy-in from this House and the greater Northern Ireland community.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As part of the agreement that was made, the Chief Constable  will retain 100% control over policing operational matters, there will be no  political interference in the judicial system and, as has been said earlier,  responsibility for national security will remain in the hands of Westminster.  That is consistent with what we said we wanted, and it is consistent with what  the unionist electorate backed us to do and endorsed in 2007.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In addition, following the Hillsborough agreement, we have  secured a financial package for the devolution of policing and justice worth  &pound;800 million. During the credit crunch and at a time when there are pressures  on government finances, that is a substantial package for the devolution of  policing and justice and has been welcomed by the Chief Constable. A package  has been agreed for the part-time Reserve, and progress has been made on  parading, including the abolition of the Parades Commission by the end of this  year.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">All of that helps to build confidence. The fact that there  will not be a Sinn F&eacute;in Justice Minister now or in the future guarantees  confidence within the unionist community. The DUP has been active in consulting  with the community, and we have ascertained that that confidence is now there.  Indeed, opinion polls of recent days have confirmed that position. As my  colleague Ian Paisley Jnr said, the wider community in Northern Ireland  want to see progress. They want us to get on with it, and they want devolution  to deliver for Northern    Ireland and make real progress in this  country.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Our achievements can be contrasted with those of the Ulster  Unionist Party, which has now stated its opposition to the motion and to the  devolution of policing and justice powers. Earlier, Mr Kennedy, in what I  presume was a Freudian slip, said &ldquo;I give up&rdquo; when he meant to say &ldquo;I will give  way&rdquo;. The unionist community gave up on the Ulster Unionist Party for a number  of reasons in 2003. We need to look at the Ulster Unionist Party&rsquo;s position in  2003. At that time, it supported the devolution of policing and justice powers.  It wanted those powers to be devolved by 2005. Indeed, my colleague Simon  Hamilton made that point earlier. However, the Ulster Unionist Party wanted to  devolve those powers in a context that was very different to that which exists  in Northern Ireland  today. At that time, Sinn F&eacute;in refused to support the police, law and order,  and the courts. In addition, the Ulster Unionist Party did not seek any safeguards  or blocks on who the Justice Minister would be. Indeed, at the time, the Ulster  Unionist Party said that the appointment of a Sinn F&eacute;in Justice Minister was  inevitable. Those were the words of the Ulster Unionist Party. Such an  appointment is not inevitable under the Democratic Unionist Party, and we have  ensured that Sinn F&eacute;in will be blocked from getting the position of Justice  Minister.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It appears that the Ulster Unionist Party has learned  little over the years. Even today, it argues for a system of election for the  Justice Minister through d&rsquo;Hondt. That, of course, would open up the position  to Sinn F&eacute;in again, and the unionist community across Northern Ireland  will be cognisant of that. Indeed, during the Hillsborough negotiations, the  UUP said that we should not discuss the issue of parading or link anything to  the devolution of policing and justice powers.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>:  Does the Member agree that, if the Ulster Unionists vote no today, they will be  voting against extra money to tackle the dissident terrorist threat in Northern  Ireland and that they will also be voting &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>:  Does the Member agree that they will also be voting to retain the Parades  Commission?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member has an extra minute to speak.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: If  the Ulster Unionist Party has its way today, &pound;800 million for the Police  Service will be lost. I do not think that that will be lost on the wider  unionist community.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Interestingly, I listened to a radio interview this morning  with David McClarty, who said that we should not worry because the motion will  be agreed even if his party votes against it. That probably highlights the sort  of principled position that the Ulster Unionist Party claims that it has today.  Indeed, we have heard much about how its opposition to the motion is to do with  the dysfunctional Executive. Let us have a look at the Executive that existed  in the previous mandate under the Ulster Unionist Party and the SDLP. That  Executive collapsed three times and made fewer decisions than the current  Executive. Therefore, when the Ulster Unionist Party talks about  dysfunctionality, it is probably speaking from a position of great experience.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member should bring his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: I  do not think that the unionist community will listen to the Ulster Unionist  Party, because that party has lost all credibility in recent days. I therefore  have no hesitation in supporting the motion, and I hope that Members will also  endorse it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  I presume that we have yet to see the snowmen on the DUP Benches, because this  is a warm day and we are having a warm debate in the Assembly. However, no  doubt, they will be along in due course. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  In the interests of good relations in the Assembly, party colleagues and I  responded to an invitation yesterday from the deputy First Minister to talk to  him. We were introduced to what I presume is his new good relations strategy.  It is called &ldquo;get out&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My party is not and never has been against the devolution  of policing and justice powers in principle. In fact, we have advocated it.  However, there was never any deal to devolve those powers in 2005. That is  false. We believe firmly that we need to aspire to the devolution of policing  and justice powers. However, the problem is that the Executive are clearly  dysfunctional. For example, the Executive did not meet or function for 150  days. The Executive are dysfunctional, and there is a battle a day. As a  Minister, I can tell Members that this Executive are different from that which  existed during the days of Ian Paisley. I can assure the House of that. At  least when Ian Paisley was First Minister, we had a First Minister with the  ability to show some leadership. That leadership is long gone. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Why are we here today? We are here as a result of Sinn F&eacute;in  blackmail. Sinn F&eacute;in said that there would be political consequences unless  policing and justice powers were devolved. To demonstrate that, Sinn F&eacute;in  closed down the Executive for 150 days, threatened the DUP, and warned that it  would walk out and collapse the institutions. At that point, of course, our  Secretary of State threatened elections. Faced with the prospect of elections,  the DUP caved in. That is why we are here today. It has nothing to do with  principle on the part of the DUP. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span> It  has nothing to do with anything other than the DUP&rsquo;s caving in at the prospect  of elections. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  I understand the angst in the DUP, Mr Speaker, because it knows that some day  it will have to face the electorate. The DUP, clinging to office, knows that it  is only putting off the evil day.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">What has the DUP conceded in order to make this deal? It  has conceded the existence of a gerrymandered and undemocratic Justice  Minister, and I am ashamed that Members from the Alliance Party would allow  themselves to be used in that way. It has conceded something around an  Irish-language act &mdash; we still do not know what &mdash; and has agreed to side deals.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  I leave it to the DUP to give way. I will not give way to it. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have the promise &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  We have the promise &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  We have the promise of an all-Ireland parliamentary forum. We have the promise  of an all-Ireland civic forum. We have the on-the-runs. The DUP now wants to  put its hands up for that. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  It is what Gerry Adams referred to as a staging post.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, there are practicalities involved. If we devolve  policing and justice powers, if the dissident threat continues to manifest  itself, and if the Justice Minister feels the need to call in the Army, where  will Sinn F&eacute;in stand then? Will Sinn F&eacute;in support the Army&rsquo;s being brought in  to support the police or will we go back to having a dysfunctional Executive? <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span> Those are very real questions. For 25  years, the British Army was what stood between this society and general civil  war. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. The Member must be heard.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  We do not want to hear him.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  Thank you, Mr Speaker.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I hear that the DUP is united: the united snowmen party.  And where is Nigel Dodds? <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. Please allow the Member to be heard.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  Where is Nigel Dodds? He said that there would be no devolution of policing and  justice powers in his political lifetime.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">This is not the time to devolve policing and justice  powers. Devolution is a precious commodity and is the future that will produce  peace and a settled society that we can hand on to the next generation.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member should bring his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGimpsey</strong>:  This proposal threatens everything that we have achieved so far.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  For many reasons, some people believe this to be a very poignant day. Some  claim that, with agreement on the devolution of policing and justice powers,  the final piece of the devolution jigsaw is in place. Although the SDLP  believes in, and has long called for, the devolution of policing and justice  powers, other outstanding matters need to be resolved; for example, building  reconciliation, establishing a bill of rights, and building stronger and better  North/South relationships.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Others will claim that it is a poignant day, on which the  people of the North no longer have a British direct rule justice Minister.  However, we have a Sinn F&eacute;in/DUP contrived deal for their anointed one. For  nationalists, it is indeed a poignant day, as Sinn F&eacute;in colludes with the DUP  to gerrymander nationalist votes, to sacrifice the principles of the Good  Friday Agreement, and to make deals on parading and a CSI strategy for a shared  future that exclude the other parties and, more importantly, were made over the  heads of the people. For the post of Justice Minister, no nationalist need  apply.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If one refers to paragraphs 3A and 3B of the motion, one  can see that events like Bloody Sunday would not be covered under devolved  matters. Indeed, the Minister of Justice would not necessarily be given any  information if agents handled by MI5 were involved.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP has put on the public record its views on that  issue in relation to the murder of Kieran Doherty, and, in private meetings  with the British and Irish Governments over many years, it has highlighted the  dangers and risks of no one in the North having oversight of, or being  accountable for, MI5.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Paragraph 1D of the motion deals with the Royal prerogative  of mercy in relation to terrorists. It is interesting that the British  Secretary of State said that today was a poignant day as he sought to pile  pressure onto the political parties. His suggestion that anyone who is not a  cheerleader for the Hillsborough Sinn F&eacute;in/DUP deal is somehow ignoring the  recent upswing in dissident republican violence is, quite frankly, outrageous.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are other matters that a Justice Minister here will  have no say in or control over, and that is a matter of concern for the SDLP.  The Director of the Public Prosecution Service will be able to hold Diplock  trials, yet the Minister of Justice will have no say in that. There is also a  need for equality monitoring throughout the criminal justice system to  establish how criminal justice is handled and secured and how the agencies that  provide criminal justice are staffed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Today is a poignant day for many victims of not only the  recent dissident republican violence but republican and loyalist terrorism of  the past 40 years. Where is the justice for the disappeared, many of whose  bodies have not yet been recovered and many of whom are only now being named as  their murders are owned up to by the IRA?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Today is also a poignant day for those in the SDLP and the  Ulster Unionist Party who have always provided leadership and done the heavy  lifting to ensure that the power-sharing institutions were brought into being.  It is a day of poignancy when we see those who did their best to bring down the  institutions over many years &mdash; some for 30-odd years &mdash; in the Chamber, and one  wonders whether the 3,000-odd deaths ever needed to happen. It is the view of  the SDLP today that dissident republican violence is wrong and futile, just as  it was its view that IRA and loyalist terrorism was futile and pointless many  years ago.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McKay</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  No, I will not give way; not today. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  Other Members have spoken about other non-political people who have done the  heavy lifting, such as the independent members of the Policing Board and the  district policing partnerships who risked their lives to oversee policing  reform. Indeed, you were a member of the Policing Board, Mr Speaker. When  politicians were asked to step up to the plate and do the heavy lifting they  lived up to the task.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I will give way to my colleague. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Durkan</strong>: I  thank the Member for giving way. The Member has recalled the first phases of  devolution under the Patten plan, which included the transfer of powers from  the Secretary of State to the Policing Board and the Chief Constable of the PSNI.  Does she agree that that period shows &mdash; just as the Policing Board was able to  confound low expectations at that time &mdash; that devolution, even with all the  difficulties that we are aware of, can still work? Does she also agree that  adding to the suite of the Executive&rsquo;s powers may be a way of improving the  functionality and performance of the Executive, contrary to the argument that  has been made by some other parties?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  Of course I agree with my party colleague on that matter.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Perhaps Mr McKay of Sinn F&eacute;in will realise that my not  giving way to him was the first time that the SDLP has excluded his party from  anything. The SDLP did not exclude Sinn F&eacute;in from any of the talks or  negotiations, and it is interesting &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I ask the Member to bring her remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  I will. In conclusion, it is a poignant day for the wider police family who  remember the murder of their colleague and friend Stephen Carroll. I pay  tribute to them and to his widow.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Robinson</strong>:  Today&rsquo;s debate must be one of the most historic since the Assembly came into  being. Today, we take another step to show the world that Northern Ireland can  truly be master of its own destiny. As we all know, some people are afraid of  progress, and they oppose, politically or violently, the political stability  that the motion further supports.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My party is delivering on a manifesto promise to complete  the devolution of policing and justice powers. To ensure that proper funding is  in place, our First Minister negotiated an additional &pound;800 million. Despite the  TUV&rsquo;s belief that it has the right to rule, using an approach that has long  since proven detrimental to unionists, my party knows that the people of  Northern Ireland want future stability, peace and economic growth, and the  devolution of policing and justice powers will help to deliver that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The fact that the police and the courts will be  operationally independent of the Justice Minister ensures that, unless parties  such as the TUV continue to split the unionist vote, neither can come under the  control of Sinn F&eacute;in, now or ever.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Over &pound;400 million will be used to compensate RUC officers  who have damaged hearing and to make recognition payments to officers of the  RUC part-time Reserve. The agreement also covers personal protection weapons,  which is a subject that has caused much concern to current and former members  of the security forces.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In a short time, the Parades Commission will be abolished,  much to the relief of the unionist people, who regarded it as contributing to  the overall parading problem. A fairer system with greater local input will be  established.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Those are all elements of an agreement that many believed  would be impossible for Northern Ireland&rsquo;s politicians to achieve. I urge all  Members to support the devolution of policing and justice powers, because it is  much too important an issue with which to play petty politics. Support for the  motion will show that Northern Ireland has matured politically.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  As Question Time commences at 3.00 pm, I suggest that the House take its ease  until that time. The debate will continue after Question Time, when the first  Member to speak will be Mrs Naomi Long.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The debate stood suspended.</p>

    <p class="OralAnswers-H1Heading"><a name="5"></a>Oral Answers to Questions</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H2DepartmentHeading">Social Development</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: It is now time for a rather sedate Question Time with the Minister  for Social Development, Ms Margaret Ritchie.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Housing Executive: Savills Report</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">1. <strong>Mr Weir </strong>asked the Minister for Social Development for her assessment of the Savills  report on the Housing Executive&rsquo;s housing stock. (AQO 903/10<a name="AQO903/10" id="AQO903/10"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development (Ms Ritchie)</strong>: In 2008, we decided to carry out an  independent assessment of the Housing Executive stock and its maintenance  costs. I commissioned Savills to carry out a stock condition survey to  determine the ongoing investment required for the Northern Ireland Housing  Executive stock.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Savills team concluded that the Housing Executive stock  was by far the best-quality housing stock that it had ever inspected across Britain and Northern Ireland. In 1974, 6&middot;3% of properties  were deemed unfit; the corresponding figure today is less than 1%. Looking at  the results of the 2009 house condition survey, the Housing Executive should be  commended for maintaining its housing stock to a high standard. The survey  shows that the work undertaken in its properties has been of high quality. The  Savills report indicates that we need to take a fresh look at our overall  maintenance strategy, and that is what we are doing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My officials continue to work with the Housing Executive to  assess the recommendations in the Savills report and are developing a  maintenance investment strategy based on those recommendations. As the Member  knows, the Social Development Committee tabled a motion on the Savills report  yesterday.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: Mr  Deputy Speaker, I am acutely aware of what you said about this Question Time  being less controversial. Therefore, Members may be glad that we are discussing  the Savills report and not the Saville report.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Given that the Savills report recommends reducing  investment in the major capital works programme, what assurance can the  Minister give my constituents that there will be investment in Housing  Executive homes and that the necessary work will be carried out in the small  number of houses that the report deemed to be poor or very poor?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: Mr Weir asks a very pertinent question. Investment in  the planned maintenance programme over the past five years has been greater  than investment in the newbuild programme. I will continue to invest in the  planned maintenance programme and in the response maintenance programme.  However, I am conscious of the limited resources that will be available to me  as a result of issues regarding capital receipts. A large part of the budget is  predicated on capital receipts and income from land sales.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have not yet finalised my Department&rsquo;s budget for next  year, but I will still bring forward money for planned maintenance, response  maintenance and elemental response. Members will recall that the Savills report  referred to the fact that, until now, we renovated properties from the front  door to the back door. That was the multi-element improvement scheme. The  Savills report tells us that that scheme is not the best value for money. It  states that the best way to ensure value for money is to carry out elemental  works by replacing kitchens or bathrooms when they have reached the end of  their useful lives.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Does the Minister agree that the  Savills report is about cutting back on maintenance and raising rents? Does she  also agree that that will hit the quality of housing in the long term and put  people in debt, especially those who will be unable to pay higher rents?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: Mr McCann will be aware that the Savills report stated  strongly that the Housing Executive provided the highest quality of maintenance  throughout these islands. I have no doubt that that high level of maintenance  will continue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">He also raised the issue of rent convergence. As I said  yesterday, we are looking at that issue. I will bring a paper to the Social  Development Committee on the issue, because I want to see the greatest possible  equity and fairness, even though many people on low incomes find it difficult  to make ends meet and, if they are not in receipt of benefit, find it difficult  to pay rent.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am in no doubt that no decisions have been taken on how  the report&rsquo;s findings will be taken forward, and I am awaiting the maintenance  investment strategy from the Housing Executive, which will help to shape my  views on the way forward for maintenance in all Housing Executive properties.  As I said yesterday &mdash; I referred to it again this morning &mdash; it is worth  pointing out that the portfolio of properties owned by the Housing Executive  now equates to the portfolio of properties in the private rented sector. We  must consider that fact in the overall context of housing provision.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: The  Savills report pointed out that the Housing Executive does a lot of ground and  security work that is not included in landlords&rsquo; functions in Great Britain,  where such work is usually carried out by the local authorities. Is the  Minister thinking about approaching local councils or the Department of the Environment  about a joint funding mechanism to take on that type of work?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: Ms Lo must have considered the Savills report  forensically. The large areas of amenity lands that cost the Housing Executive  a considerable amount of money to maintain is one of many areas that the report  examined. We are considering the issues to determine how those areas can be  best used to benefit the local population. I await the report on the  maintenance strategy and the estate management strategy from the Housing  Executive.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member raised the issue of councils. We must always  remember that the functions of councils in Britain are different to those  here. In Britain,  councils have responsibility for housing and estates. That does not happen in Northern Ireland,  and it is not part of the suite of functions that will be devolved to councils  under the review of public administration.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Burns</strong>:  The Savills report highlighted certain aspects of the Northern Ireland Housing  Executive&rsquo;s costs. Does the Minister have any view on the Housing Executive&rsquo;s  land and estate management costs?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: The Savills report provided useful information for the  Department for Social Development&rsquo;s (DSD) annual subsidy determination for the  Housing Executive&rsquo;s landlord function and will assist the Housing Executive and  my officials in housing division in targeting resources to where they are most  needed. We must remember that resources are scarce at the moment, and we must  ensure that they are targeted at the people who need them most.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Savills highlighted the significant costs that are  associated with the maintenance of the amenity lands in and around Housing  Executive estates. My colleague will understand that that was the issue that Ms  Lo raised. We have real opportunities to use that land better, and I have asked  the Housing Executive to come up with a plan to offer sites to tenants for use  as allotments. That would benefit the local community. Ultimately, if the  Housing Executive land bank is put to best use, we can reduce estate management  costs substantially.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Moneymore: Antisocial Behaviour</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">2. <strong>Mr I  McCrea </strong>asked the Minister for Social Development what role her Department  is playing in addressing antisocial behaviour in Moneymore. (AQO 904/10<a name="AQO904/10" id="AQO904/10"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I presume that the question relates to antisocial  behaviour in a housing context as opposed to matters that should be addressed  directly to the Police Service.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Northern Ireland Housing Executive is committed to  tackling any form of antisocial behaviour wherever it occurs on its estates. It  will seek to respond to instances of antisocial behaviour whether the  complainant is a Housing Executive tenant, private tenant, owner-occupier or  any other person who is visiting its property. It is also committed to  preventing antisocial behaviour through a range of interventions, support and  diversionary measures, and it works closely with other agencies in that  respect.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Housing Executive has not received any recent complaints  about antisocial behaviour in the Moneymore area but is aware that the police  are investigating a number of recent incidents of a criminal nature. The  Housing Executive has entered into an information-sharing protocol with the  PSNI, Cookstown District Council and the Youth Justice Agency to facilitate  closer partnership working. I will be pleased to accept the details of any  specific concerns that Ian McCrea has about the situation in Moneymore.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her answer. I am sure that she is aware that it is  difficult for the community in Moneymore to live with the blight of antisocial  behaviour. She mentioned that the Housing Executive&rsquo;s role in dealing with  antisocial behaviour is different from that of the PSNI. There is a concern &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Please ask a question, Mr McCrea.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  I am coming to the question, Mr Deputy Speaker.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a concern among tenants in the private rented  sector that there is little that the Housing Executive can do about antisocial  behaviour. Will the Minister consider removing or suspending housing benefits  that are being claimed by people who live in privately rented accommodation and  who are responsible for the most extreme instances of such behaviour?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: That would be a punitive course of action. Measures  such as suspending housing benefits or initiating eviction proceedings are  always a last resort. We will always attempt to address such problems through  preventative measures, and only if those fail will compulsory actions be  initiated that could lead to eviction.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I take Ian McCrea&rsquo;s point about suspending housing  benefits. I presume that the Member asked the question because he has  information about particular cases of antisocial behaviour. Perhaps he will  provide the details of those cases to me so that they can be fully  investigated.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Armstrong</strong>:  Does the Minister agree that the situation in Moneymore is worse than anywhere  else in mid-Ulster because of a historical lack of investment in facilities for  young people in that area? Will she make some funds available to assist such  facilities?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: Mr Armstrong will appreciate that I am not totally  acquainted with what is happening in Moneymore. Perhaps he will advise me about  that so that I can conduct a proper investigation from a housing perspective.  Youth Service provision is an issue for another Department. However, Mr  Armstrong is probably aware that the Housing Executive, to facilitate closer  partnership working, has entered into an information-sharing protocol with the  police, Cookstown District Council and the Youth Justice Agency. The Housing  Executive and other agencies recently published a leaflet that outlines that  working relationship and the responsibilities of each agency. Individual cases  are considered at regular inter-agency meetings, and decisions are made about  future action and determining the lead agency&rsquo;s responsibility.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There may be particular instances of antisocial behaviour  that affect tenants who are trying to lead a normal daily life, and I  sympathise with those people. Perhaps Mr Armstrong could furnish me with the  details of any such instances so that we can carry out a full investigation and  provide you with a full and detailed written reply.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Minister, I am feeling a little neglected, because you seem to be  addressing your remarks away from the Chair. I call Mickey Brady.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Is the Minister open to giving  stronger powers to local authorities and communities to deal with antisocial  behaviour under the new housing Bill?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I am happy to consider any issues that relate to the  forthcoming housing Bill. However, the Member will be aware that that Bill will  deal with the regulation of private landlords and light-touch landlord  registration. The Member has been seeking those measures for some time. There  is no doubt that there is a direct correlation between legislation for the  private rented sector, regulation of landlords and possible antisocial  behaviour.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Shared Future</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">3. <strong>Mr  O&rsquo;Loan </strong>asked the Minister for Social Development for an update on the work  of her Department in promoting a shared future. (AQO 905/10<a name="AQO905/10" id="AQO905/10"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: Since becoming Minister, the progression of the concept  of a shared future for all has been at the fore&shy;front of my agenda. That is  because I, like many others, realise that if we fail to build an inclusive  future, we jeopardise our opportunity to secure lasting peace, sustainable  communities and economic prosperity. We run the risk of playing into the hands  of those who use random, callous acts of violence to try to turn the clock  back. For that reason, I have ensured that shared future objectives are  integral to my Department&rsquo;s policies and programmes. Those objectives include  the delivery of shared housing and the provision of quality shared spaces in  physical development projects across Northern Ireland, work to address  the problems at interface areas, and encouragement of cross-community work in  disadvantaged communities.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, the impact of my work is hampered, undoubtedly, by  the absence of a strategic approach to that vital issue across government.  Members will be aware that following 14 public meetings across the North about  a shared future, I have made a commitment to bring a paper to the Executive on  that critical issue. Members will also appreciate that the conventions  governing such matters mean that I cannot go into detail of what such a paper  might contain, but it breaks no confidence if I tell Members that it will  propose measures for picking up the pace on a shared future and ensuring that  the characteristics of shared future thinking find their way into the DNA of  policy development and decision-making across the Executive.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that the paper will receive the support of my  Executive colleagues and that its proposals will help to ensure that a shared  future becomes a priority for the Executive as a whole.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  thank the Minister for her answer and for the leadership that she has shown on  the matter. Does she have any view on the cohesion, sharing and integration  (CSI) strategy that was agreed by the Office of the First Minister and deputy  First Minister (OFMDFM) recently?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: We are told that the cohesion, sharing and integration  strategy that has been languishing in OFMDFM for years has been agreed. If that  is true, I welcome it. However, it is a matter of concern that when I asked for  a copy of it, I was refused one, but then I am just a democratically elected  Executive Minister. When I was refused a copy, I asked when I could receive  one. On 25 February, I was told, inexplicably, that it would be two weeks. I  look forward to getting my copy of the document on Thursday, and I hope that  there will not be any more excuses on the matter.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If CSI is agreed, and if it still has any substance, it can  provide a long-term vision and a practical framework for achieving a shared  future. It can provide a vision framework to help all of us to work together to  build a future that is free from sectarianism and division. I would like to  think that everyone in the House would aspire to that as we try to build a more  normal and reconciled society on this part of the island.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  It is remarkable how parties that have complained for years about the lack of  CSI and that did nothing about it now seem to complain about progress having  been made.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Everyone agrees on the concept of a shared future in  housing. Will the Minister outline whether there have been any retrenchments in  existing shared future housing developments where unfortunate incidents have  happened? What mechanisms are in place to ensure that agreements that are  signed up to are maintained by all residents in those developments?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I am surprised by the Member&rsquo;s comments. What is  absolutely true about the SDLP is that since its foundation, it has always  believed in a truly reconciled society. That is inherent in us; it is part of  our DNA. We work for a reconciled society. We have implemented a shared society  through partnership arrangements in local government since 1973. It is to be  regretted that other parties are only latter-day converts to that concept.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Hamilton raised issues about shared future estates and  neighbourhoods, which are two aspects of the shared future housing agenda. I  will launch a further tranche of shared future neighbourhoods shortly. Every  development in the newbuild housing programme is screened in accordance with a  shared future. The Member should convey to me any issues that he has in  relation to an already constructed shared future housing scheme, and I will  have those investigated fully.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I hope that every Member in the House aspires to a shared  future and a shared future in housing through shared future neighbourhoods and  estates, of which there are now many throughout Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  The Department for Social Development has a key responsibility in town centre,  housing and community regeneration. Does the Minister agree that her exclusion  from significant involvement in developing the CSI strategy is a major mistake  and another sign of a degree of dysfunctionality in the way in which the Office  of the First Minister and deputy First Minister operates?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I agree with Mr Beggs that it is deeply regrettable  that the CSI strategy has not been an inclusive process. Inclusion and bringing  people together are at the very core of cohesion, sharing and integration, and  all parties need to be involved in the strategy. It is regrettable that the CSI  paper was not available at the last Executive meeting, given that we were told  on the public airwaves, two days before the meeting, that it had been agreed by  the First Minister and deputy First Minister without recourse to Executive colleagues.  That is hardly the way to run government.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Incapacity Benefit</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">4. <strong>Mr Boylan </strong>asked the Minister for Social Development how many people are currently in  receipt of incapacity benefit. (AQO 906/10<a name="AQO906/10" id="AQO906/10"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: There are currently 97,143 incapacity benefit claimants  in Northern Ireland.  That figure includes those who are entitled to payment of the benefit and those  who, although not entitled to payment, receive weekly National Insurance  credits. The figure equates to 8&middot;8% of the working-age population.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Employment and support allowance (ESA) has replaced income  support that is paid on the grounds of a new claimant&rsquo;s incapacity and  incapacity benefit. However, incapacity benefit remains available to those who  satisfy the linking rules. There are two ways in which linking rules can apply  to clients. First, people who received incapacity benefit previously can return  to receiving the benefit at the same rate providing they reclaim within eight  weeks of the end of their previous claim. Secondly, those who have been  incapacitated for more than 28 weeks may qualify providing their claim has not  been disallowed and they started work or training within one month of the end  of their previous claim.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Boylan</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for her  answer. Does she agree that the fact that people on incapacity benefit are not  classed as economically inactive has a serious impact on the unemployment  figures?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank the Member for his question. The best place to  deal with that issue is the House of Commons, where it is possible to amend the  parity legislation that deals with welfare reform and other matters relating to  benefit. One is better to be in the place in which the parent legislation  originated.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>:  Given the concerns in my Strangford constituency about incapacity benefit and  other benefits, what impact, if any, does the Minister feel there will be on  the contacting out of medical assessments?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank Mr Bell for his question. That is one of the  issues under consideration. I want to ensure best quality in benefit uptake and  ensure that those who are entitled to benefits are able to access them, whether  through their local social security jobs and benefits office, an advice centre  or the constituency office of a Member of the Assembly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It has been remiss of me not to have said this previously,  but it is possible for Members to view the way that employment and support  allowance is calculated by visiting the ESA centre at James House. So far, to  my knowledge, only one Member, Dolores Kelly, has taken the opportunity to make  that visit. That access is available to all Members.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  Will the Minister indicate how the planned welfare reform, which emanates from  the UK Government in London,  will impact upon benefit claimants in the North?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: The stated aim of welfare reform is to encourage and  enable as many people as possible to return to the labour market. To that end,  the reforms will ensure that the welfare system provides people with the  opportunities that they need to improve their skills, prepare for work and move  off benefits and into employment where that is appropriate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, I am concerned that the welfare reform proposals,  which will be introduced in full whether a Labour or Conservative Government  are elected in Westminster,  could be applied in a way that is unfair. In the North, we have less affordable  childcare than in Britain,  and there are other distinguishing factors. As the detailed application of welfare  reforms will be decided in London, it is important, as I stressed earlier to Mr  Boylan, that all our MPs take their seats and engage on this issue at Committee  Stage of welfare reform Bills in the House of Commons. It is pointless for a  certain party to complain about British welfare legislation and parity issues  when, by not taking its seats in the House of Commons, it does little to change  the legislation.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Community Development: &nbsp;North Antrim</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">5. <strong>Mr  Paisley Jnr </strong>asked the Minister for Social Development for an update on the  delivery of the community development fund in north Antrim. (AQO 907/10<a name="AQO907/10" id="AQO907/10"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I congratulate Mr Paisley on his selection to follow in  his father&rsquo;s footsteps in north Antrim. I hope that he gets a much bigger vote  than Jim Allister, even if that leaves him a few thousand votes short of my  colleague Declan O&rsquo;Loan. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I presume that Mr Paisley refers to the range of community  support in north Antrim. We provide support and funding totalling &pound;527,000 to  community development in north Antrim through the following programmes: the  neighbourhood renewal programme, which covers Ballykeel and Ballee estates; the  small pockets of deprivation programme, which provides funding to the Carnany,  Castle and Glebeside areas of Ballymoney; the Dunclug community chest, which  seeks to build community cohesion; the areas at risk programme, which provides  support to communities in Harryville and the Doury Road area of Ballymena; the  community investment fund, which provides support to the Ballymoney Community  Resource Centre; and the community support programme, which provides funding  through district councils in the north Antrim constituency. I recall that the Member  has raised the issue of Doury Road  with me in the past. I am sure that he appreciates that there has been much  investment in community support in that constituency.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>:  I appreciate the Minister&rsquo;s good wishes, but I hope that her foretelling of the  future is faulty.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In my constituency, the Good Morning Ballycastle project  assists the elderly, the Ballykeel Community Association assists the young, the  elderly and business start-ups, and Mosside Community Association tries to  address all those needs. They provide a snapshot of community needs, and they  all benefit from DSD funding, as the Minister said.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: You must ask a question, Mr Paisley.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Paisley Jnr</strong>:  When that funding evaporates in March, what means has the Minister to ensure  that the valuable work that those associations carry out will continue for  another valuable period of investment?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I hear what the Member says about the good community  development that is taking place in those areas, and, from my visits to them, I  know about that good work and the involvement of local community volunteers in  promoting community cohesion and development.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">If the Member sends me further details, I will be  happy to look at them.</p>

    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>: I  welcome the move to allow for the devolution of policing and justice powers to  the Northern Ireland Assembly, and I support the motion. It is good that, as on  other issues, locally elected and locally accountable people will have the  opportunity to influence and direct policy on policing and justice matters and  to work with their colleagues in the Executive to bring some coherence to policing  and justice policy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also recognise that the devolution of policing and  justice is the final piece of the devolution process, which has been  outstanding since 1998. It is a good sign, despite the criticism that it has  drawn, that there now seems to be sufficient agreement to complete the  devolution process. I cannot see that there is a negative in that. So, that is  a good sign.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">From the beginning, much of the debate on the issue has  been characterised as rancorous, and it has only gone downhill since then.  People are tired of the tone of the debate, and certainly the public and the  people with whom I am in contact would like to see real debate and real  progress on the issues. People want to see the Assembly work and survive. They  do not want to see it move from crisis to crisis, and most of them recognise  that the devolution of policing and justice is a key aspect of progress.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">David Ford laid out the Alliance Party&rsquo;s position, and I  will not retread that ground. However, I want to look at some of the arguments  that were made for voting against the motion. The first and primary argument is  that the Executive are dysfunctional. I want to tackle that, because it is an  important issue in the mind of the public. I believe that the Executive are  dysfunctional and, on occasion, fail to perform. However, unlike those who put  forward that argument, I do not believe that that is entirely the  responsibility of the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in. All four parties in the Executive have  contributed at different times to its dysfunctionality. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>:  The Ulster Unionists are making a lot of noise in the corner, which is not  unusual. What ultimately matters, however, is how they handle these issues. It  is worth bearing it in mind that, when the DUP did to them what they are now  trying to do to the DUP, the DUP&rsquo;s stated aim was to destroy these  institutions. Is that what the Ulster Unionist Party is seriously about, and is  that the stance that it is taking out to its electorate? I wonder how clearly thought  through that position is.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Furthermore, part of the dysfunctionality has been due to  the fact that the smaller parties in the Executive have tried to be both in the  Executive and opposed to the Executive. That is dysfunctionality in essence,  and it needs to be addressed. When people are in the Executive, they need to  stand up and take decisions as a collective. That needs to be seen to happen,  as that is part of the dysfunctionality. When the Ulster Unionist Party leader  Sir Reg Empey and the SDLP leader Margaret Ritchie come together with their  task force, they will, hopefully, be able to bring forward proposals that will  deal with that part of the dysfunctionality, as well as all the other issues  that they have highlighted.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Danny Kennedy accused me of not listening to what the  Ulster Unionist Party said, but I did listen. He said that he was not happy  that the Executive now act only in the interests of the two and the few. I did  not hear Mr Kennedy raise his voice when his party was one of the two and the  few. Members need to be aware of consistency in their own behaviour.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At the core of the current issues about dysfunctionality is  the fact that we have lurched from crisis to crisis, much of it driven by the  focus on policing and justice. It has distracted Members from the ordinary  business of government. On many occasions, it has led to a hiatus on other  matters while people take hostages around the Executive table on policy issues  to further their position. The continuation of that uncertainty is not good for  governance or Executive functionality. The devolution of policing and justice  powers will make a significant contribution to resolving that dysfunctionality.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Alliance Party&rsquo;s position regarding the justice  Ministry has already been clarified for the public mind. The topic is not up  for debate today, although, given the ire that we have drawn from the SDLP in  particular, one would think that it was. Today, the Alliance Party speaks on  the SDLP side of the argument because we are in favour of the devolution of  policing and justice powers. I noticed that the former SDLP leader, Mark  Durkan, had to intervene during Dolores Kelly&rsquo;s speech to remind her that she  does not have common cause on this issue with the Ulster Unionist Party. From  listening to her speech, it sounded as if she did.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is hugely important that policing and justice &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  am grateful to the Member for giving way. Given the SDLP&rsquo;s inconsistencies  today, does she not think that it is ironic that one SDLP Member complains about  a potential protocol that would give the Justice Minister the ability to  interfere with operational aspects of the Chief Constable&rsquo;s role, which is a  smoke&shy;screen, and other Members complain that the PPS has too much independence  and there must be some interference. The SDLP is all over the place.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member will have an extra minute.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>: I  absolutely agree with my colleague. In some cases, we have seen inconsistency  on those issues. We had a debate on the CSI strategy, and that topic was raised  again today. Let us be very clear: the leader of the SDLP is happy to nominate  a Justice Minister without there being any progress at all on a shared future.  She is also willing to throw aside the common understanding of a shared future  by continuing to pigeonhole members of my party, who have made a stand to say  that we do not fit the two tribes mentality. She continues to pigeonhole us in  a sectarian way that does not reflect our expressed identity. That is not the  essence of a shared future.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When it comes to the position of the Ulster Unionist Party  &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>:  The position of the Ulster Unionist Party ultimately requires courage. What the  party has done tactically is foolish.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member should draw her remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>: It  is clear that the party has no influence on the process &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>: It  looks like petty electioneering. The UUP has differentiated itself from the  DUP.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>:  How does it differentiate itself from the TUV?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  Members will not be surprised to hear that I support the motion. I hope that  every Member, even those who have concerns, will recognise that certain groups  and certain people have put much hard work into this process so far. Other  Members here today &mdash; we heard them because the debate has been acrimonious to  say the least &mdash; sniped and made remarks not because they have that option but  because they stayed at the side of the playground, unwilling to play ball and  screaming foul play at any opportunity.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We are not tumbling into the devolution of policing and  justice powers headlong at full speed with no thought or consideration about  what we are doing. That could not be further from reality. It has taken a long  time to come to the decision to support the devolution of policing and justice  powers. That has ensured security for the people of the Province, as well as  &pound;800 million for policing, the police Reserve pension, hearing loss claims,  legal aid and the organisation of the Justice Department. We ensured that there  are adequate resources available for the future and for those who secured our  safety in days gone by. My colleague Ian Paisley Jnr made comments earlier  about Allan Bresland and Jimmy Spratt, and we recognise their contribution.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">After intense talks in the past, the DUP negotiating team  managed to pull together the deal that was needed to allow the Province to  prosper. Despite all the media attention and the machinations of some Members,  we achieved something that will satisfy the people of the Province. The  agreement will provide a constructive way forward.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Earlier today in the Chamber, we heard comprehensive  reports from the Chairperson of the Assembly and Executive Review Committee and  the deputy First Minister. They went into great detail about the precise nature  of the Bill and about what will happen next. I congratulate all those who  worked so hard in putting the agreement together because their contribution is  sometimes not recognised.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is no secret that I am well known for my constituency  work. I work hard on the ground and listen to what is said. For every person  who has expressed concern to me and whose concerns, heightened by  gossipmongers, I have allayed, 10 more have told me to get the job done so that  Northern Ireland can move forward. I have been approached by ex-servicemen from  the RUC and Army who have heard many rumours about the deal, spread by those  who seek to sow seeds of discord to suit their own political agenda.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have been able to state with certainty that there will be  no Sinn F&eacute;in control of policing and justice or a Sinn F&eacute;in Justice Minister.  That guarantee is and will remain enshrined; to that we are committed. I have  had Loyal Institution members in my office &mdash; more than one Member in the  Chamber is also a member of a Loyal Institution &mdash; who understood that the deal  was looked at by the Orange  and by the Black Institutions, which were satisfied with their gains. Those  people have told me so. The 95% of people who supported the deal on Saturday  past is a clear indication of that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The agreement means that the Parades Commission will not be  in place next year; that additional resources have been secured for the police  and the courts; that there is money for the part-time Reserve and more officers  on the streets; and that there is more money for those who suffered loss of  hearing in service and who fought for years to win it and have long deserved  it. We do not nor will we ever forget the sacrifice made by those men and women  in the past. The devolution of policing and justice makes provision for that  too. There will be more funding for legal aid, which means that people in need  of help from the courts will be able to receive it. Ask any mother embroiled in  a custody battle and she will say that that her legal aid is essential.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Now is not the time for Ulster Unionists to beat their  chests and say that they do not agree and want no part of the deal.  Unfortunately, that deal is here. It was secured by the Good Friday Agreement,  in which they had a very strong hand. We are tied into matters; therefore, we  have worked within the framework of the Executive, of which Ulster Unionists  are a part, to secure the best financial and security package for the Province.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Most Members in the Chamber are fathers or mothers who  remember when they were driving their kids somewhere in the car and the wee  ones in the back seat would ask, &ldquo;Are we there yet? Are we there yet?&rdquo;. There  they are &mdash; the Ulster Unionists &mdash; asking whether they are there yet. The DUP,  the SDLP, Sinn F&eacute;in and the Alliance Party are in the driving seat, and we are  moving forward. Those Ulster Unionist children are in the back seat saying,  &ldquo;Are we there yet?&rdquo;. They want us all to do the hard work, but they will not do  anything to contribute to it. If anyone wants to know who those people are,  they are the ones in the short trousers with the teddy bears.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I support the motion. The Ulster Unionists should stop  whingeing from the back seat; join in the conversation with everyone else in  the car; support the motion; and move forward with policing and justice.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member must bring his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Shannon</strong>:  They should do it now and have the guts to support us. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Sir Reg Empey</strong>:  Today&rsquo;s proceedings are the normal procedures of parliamentary democracy. They  are procedures that we have inherited from the Mother of Parliaments and, as in  any parliamentary democracy, there will be different points of view. Some  parties will agree with the motion, and some will not. That is how  parliamentary democracy functions. Those of us who find ourselves, in good  conscience, unable to support the motion believe that the conditions are not  yet right. We are doing what we were sent to this House to do: exercising our  judgement. We are seeking to serve the best interests of all the people of Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Those who have any understanding of Ulster Unionism will  know that we do not take pleasure in voting no. I am immensely proud of the  sacrifices my party has made for the cause of peace. Our determination to make  Stormont work for all the people of Northern Ireland &mdash; unionists,  nationalists, all of us &mdash; continues. Our wholehearted support for the brave men  and women of the PSNI continues unabated.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Before, during and after the Hillsborough process, my party  declared that it would make a judgement on the basis of three fundamental  principles. The first is the need for the power-sharing Executive to function  as a four-party coalition. To say that the Executive have not done so since May  2007 is to state the obvious. If the Executive are to represent all the people  of Northern Ireland,  they will have to function as any other coalition functions, on the basis of  equality between the coalition partners.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The second principle is the pressing need to ensure that  the Executive address rather than ignore the education debacle. For more than  two years, the Executive have not discussed post-primary transfer. That is not  the only matter in education &mdash; far from it &mdash; but it is holding up progress on  other fronts. My party does not expect others to agree with it about all  education issues. It is, however, looking for consensus in place of strife.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Thirdly, there is the matter of policing and justice  itself. Ulster Unionists believe in the devolution of policing and justice  powers. However, we do not believe in devolving those sensitive powers to an  Executive who are incapable of deciding how to transfer children from primary  to post-primary schools, for example. The stark fact is that the leaders of the  parties in the Executive have not had a single conversation together about how  to respond to the dissident threat or about how the institutions will approach  major disagreement between the parties on policing and justice matters. That  concerns me greatly. Does it not seem reasonable that, by this stage, we should  have had some preliminary talks to ensure that we are able to stand together  when the inevitable challenge comes from those elements?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">None of our three principles has been addressed in a  meaningful way. The Executive are still not working as they should, and there  is no prospect of them operating as a genuine coalition, as we saw from the  deputy First Minister&rsquo;s rant against my party this morning. The education  debacle remains unaddressed. The context for the devolution of policing and  justice powers remains unstable.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I recognise that the First Minister attempted to address  some of my party&rsquo;s concerns, but he faces the same issue that my party and I  face: Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s attitude. Progress is being held up by Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s unwillingness  to accept the normal democratic conventions of coalition government. Sinn  F&eacute;in&rsquo;s rejection of the Executive&rsquo;s working together as a coalition of equal  partners has been gravely disappointing. I hope that, in the days to come, Sinn  F&eacute;in will reflect on that and move to a position that is in the interests of  good government for all the people of Northern Ireland. When lecturing us  earlier about instability in the institutions, the deputy First Minister seemed  to forget that Sinn F&eacute;in is the party that brought the Executive to a  standstill for over 154 days during a global economic crisis. That same party  now has the bare-faced cheek to lecture others about the workings of the  Executive.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Ulster Unionist Party is unable to support the motion.  My party and I have, in good faith, sought compromise, and so we will exercise  our right according to the principles of parliamentary democracy. We will vote  against a motion that we believe is not in the best interests of our society at  this time, and we will do so as a democratic political party that is pledged to  making power-sharing work in an inclusive manner for all the people of Northern  Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member should bring his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Sir Reg Empey</strong>:  We exercise our right to refuse to bow to the blackmailing and bullying to  which we have been subjected in recent weeks.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. Ba mhaith liom tac&uacute; leis an r&uacute;n.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Despite the comments of the previous Member to speak and  some other Members and despite media commentary, the debate is not about the  Ulster Unionist Party; it is about the transfer of policing and justice powers  to the locally elected representatives in the Chamber. Everything does not have  to be perfect on day one &mdash; far from it &mdash; but local politicians must start to  build a new justice system and a new framework with which to manage policing  and justice matters.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As the final Sinn F&eacute;in Member to speak, I wish to comment  on a few of the contributions thus far. I want to nail &mdash; if necessary, I am  sure that Mr Speaker will correct me if I cannot use this terminology &mdash; the lie  that the SDLP has been using not only in the Chamber but on the airwaves about  how the Justice Minister will be appointed and about where the agreement to do  so came from. How to appoint the Justice Minister is not in the Hillsborough  agreement. It was not agreed or sorted out in Hillsborough. It was sorted out  in the Chamber on 1 December 2009 at 6.26 pm, as recorded in Hansard:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Question put and agreed to.</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">Resolved:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">That the Department of Justice Bill <span class="Italic">[NIA 1/09] do now pass.&rdquo;  &mdash; [Official Report, Vol 46, No 4, p254, col 1]</span>.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Perhaps the SDLP has not read the Bill, so I shall read  what it voted for at 6.26 pm on 1 December 2009. Clause 2 relates to the  Minister in charge of the Department of Justice. It states that the Department  of Justice is to be in the charge of a Minister appointed by virtue of a  nomination &mdash;</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;(a) made by one or more members of the Assembly; and</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">(b) approved by a resolution of the Assembly passed  with the support of &mdash;</p>
    <p class="BillAmend-AmendedTextIndent">(i) a majority of the members voting on  the motion for the resolution,</p>
    <p class="BillAmend-AmendedTextIndent">(ii) a majority of the designated  Nationalists voting, and</p>
    <p class="BillAmend-AmendedTextIndent">(iii) a majority of the designated  Unionists voting.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">At 6.26 pm on 1 December 2009, the SDLP voted for  that clause. If the SDLP is serious that that is gerrymandering, a corruption  of democracy and a dismantling of the Good Friday Agreement, why did it vote  for it at 6.26 pm on 1 December 2009? If the SDLP honestly believes that, why  did it vote for it? Mr Speaker, you will perhaps challenge me again, but I will  tell you why the SDLP voted for it: because it does not believe its own  propaganda. The SDLP knows that, when it goes on the airwaves and stands in the  Chamber and talks about Sinn F&eacute;in denying it its democratic right, it is lying,  because it voted for it. It was not arranged at Hillsborough or in any back  room anywhere else with the DUP. The SDLP voted for it in the Chamber.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In a recent interview, Margaret Ritchie spoke about the  beginning of her new leadership and how she would perhaps bring the parties to  court over the fact that the SDLP was being denied the justice ministry. That  would be an interesting court case. It would be entitled &lsquo;Ritchie v Ritchie&rsquo;,  because she is part of those who established the voting mechanisms for the  establishment of that ministry.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Moving on, today is not about the Ulster Unionist Party,  the SDLP or Sinn F&eacute;in. It is about the continuing building of the peace  process. While many on the opposite Benches &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maskey</strong>:  In the case of Ritchie v Ritchie, would it be appropriate for her to seek  counsel from Mr Maginness or Mr Attwood as former solicitors?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>: I  would advise her to seek legal advice from another quarter, but that is another  story.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">This is about building another chapter in the peace  process. Members on the opposite Benches rightly talk about their experiences  of the past, but it has not been an easy journey for republicans either. The  policing journey has not been an easy one for republicans, and we have had to  make many compromises that were difficult for us. Indeed, some republicans  could not go along with those compromises. I respect that. They have left and  have gone on to other ventures. I am not talking about those armed groups; I am  talking about the people who have decided that they cannot agree with the Sinn  F&eacute;in strategy, and that is fair enough. However, Members on the opposite  Benches, particularly those in Ulster Unionist Party who have just lectured the  deputy First Minister, need to realise that politics is about the art of  compromise.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Everything is not perfect in the Executive, and everything  is not perfect across many of its Departments, but if we are serious about  putting up a challenge to those who threaten violence on our streets today is  an opportunity to do that. It is an opportunity to move forward on the peace  process with a united voice and to bring justice and policing powers to the  Assembly whereby we appoint the Minister and the scrutiny Committee and we  start scrutinising and rebuilding a justice service that everybody can be  involved in.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On Sunday, I attended a march for a family who have been  waiting 20 years for an inquest for their son and brother. On Monday, I  attended a court case for six families who have been waiting three decades for  an inquest to be held into the death of their loved ones. The justice system  thus far has let down many people. We have the challenge of creating a justice  system that will not be perfect overnight, but it can deliver a new beginning  to policing and justice in this society.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I agree with the deputy First Minister that the devolution of policing and  justice is long overdue, and the very fact that we are discussing it today is a  tribute to the people who, over a long time, went about implementing the  changes to policing and justice that were outlined in the Good Friday  Agreement. It is also a tribute to those who joined the PSNI and who applied to  the PSNI, to the people who were members of the first and second Policing  Boards and to all the rest of the people who were advocates for change. This  vote today is first and foremost their achievement. However, in voting for the  devolution of justice and policing powers, we are not voting for the  Hillsborough agreement.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At the beginning of the debate, the deputy First Minister  explained that the motion is long because it was decided that it was necessary  to err on the side of completeness and transparency. He added that we were  entering an era of joint and equal working. If nationalism is to be excluded  from government, it will be not an era of joint and equal working but the  reverse. It is not to err on the side of completeness and transparency to do  deals on parading over the heads of the community or to fail, to date, to  publish a so-called agreement on a shared future. If the deputy First Minister  believes those words about transparency and an era of joint and equal working,  let us see the proof in the shared future strategy and on parading.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Dowd</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I am coming to you now.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr O&rsquo;Dowd spoke about how the SDLP has voted. The SDLP has  been consistent in voting for the principle of devolution of justice powers and  opposing its terms. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span> I will come to  the Department of Justice Bill.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  In every debate and vote on the matter in the Chamber, that has been the  principle. Unlike the principle that Mr O&rsquo;Dowd outlined on 1 December 2009,  when he said that, if the SDLP was interested in having an extra seat in  government, it should:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;fill in a CV, present it to the DUP and have  discussions on the matter.&rdquo; &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Official Report, Vol 46, No 4, p239, col 1]</span>.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic"><span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  In any case, if it is not unparliamentary to talk about a lie, Mr O&rsquo;Dowd said  that what we did in the vote was an endorsement of the exclusion of  nationalists from government and that that was when it happened. That is wrong.  On 9 February 2010, Martin McGuinness said something that deserves to come back  to haunt him. He said:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;Every single Member knew from the very beginning of  this term of the Assembly that there was no prospect whatsoever of the  Democratic Unionist Party agreeing to the transfer of policing and justice  powers in the context of the d&rsquo;Hondt mechanism.&rdquo; &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Official Report, Vol 48, No 2, p97, col 2]</span>.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">He said that &ldquo;every single Member&rdquo; knew: that is  you and you and you and you.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I will give way in a second. In May 2007, Sinn F&eacute;in knew that it was the  intention of Peter Robinson and the DUP not to go down the road of running  d&rsquo;Hondt. That is when the lie began; that is when the error was committed; and  that is when the injustice and inequality towards nationalism was introduced.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  Will the Member also acknowledge the consistency of the Alliance Party&rsquo;s  inconsistent approach? <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. The Member must be heard.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  It is curious that Mrs Long said that there were inconsistencies in how other  parties behaved. Will she answer the question that Mr Ford failed to answer  last week? Last November, Anna Lo, who, unfortunately, is not in the Chamber,  said that it would be almost impossible for progress to be made on justice  matters unless the Executive produced a cohesion, sharing and integration  strategy to show that they are doing all that they can to eradicate prejudice.  Mrs Long cannot have it both ways. Her party cannot, on the one hand, say that  the Executive have to produce a strategy and, on the other hand, on the basis  of an unpublished and unfinished secret document written by the First Minister  and the deputy First Minister, nominate for the justice Ministry. The Alliance  Party cannot have it both ways.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  No, I will not. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. Allow the Member to continue.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  We want to see the devolution of justice powers work to the maximum. Good  comments were made by Members, including Sinn F&eacute;in Members, in that regard. We  have differences with the UUP today over the vote, but I do not diminish by one  iota the fact that, for years, the UUP, unlike the DUP, attempted to make  progress on policing and politics, and it led when the DUP failed. What I find  utterly reprehensible is the behaviour, unseemly words and conduct of the  Secretary of State. That same behaviour was demonstrated this morning by the  deputy First Minister, who said that the UUP&rsquo;s was one of the most  dysfunctional political positions that he had ever come across. How those who,  along with loyalism and state forces &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I ask the Member to bring his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  &mdash; were responsible for threats and terror can refer to other people as having  dysfunctional political positions escapes me.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>:  With regard to policing, is it not, in fact, a good day for Northern Ireland  and its entire people? Northern    Ireland has come of age. It is a new day and  a new dawn. The hope that exists throughout Northern Ireland, in communities  from the west to the east, is that the Assembly can take responsibility for  policing and get it right.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As a unionist who has decried the loss of those powers when  I was just two years of age &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Dr Paisley says that I am a beautiful baby. I was two years  old when unionism lost those powers. I turned 40 years of age of Sunday. I am  delighted that unionism will regain those powers.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Of all the skills that policing requires, surely chief  among them is the ability to deliver justice. Many Members are able to  celebrate the time when they got elected. However, when I was originally  elected to Craigavon Borough Council in 1997, I could not celebrate because the  lives of Constable Graham and Reserve Constable Johnston were taken by brutal  acts of terrorism. I saw the blood of innocent heroes on the streets of Lurgan.  I can never celebrate becoming elected, because that memory will always be with  me.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It takes courage for men and women from all backgrounds to  continue to police Northern Ireland.  They literally risk life and limb. Constable Carroll was a hero who risked his  life, which he laid down for our tomorrow. Heroes, such as Peadar Heffron, have  lost limbs to defend me, my children and society in Northern Ireland. We owe a great  deal to those police officers.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Many Members, such as Mr Kelly and others, have received  death threats. When I was chairman of Craigavon District Policing Partnership,  death threats came to me. Police visited my wife at home. She was told that I  could not come home until I had been to the nearest police station. I had to  leave my young children.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It was then that we determined that we would never ever  give in. Policing had to be got right. The Chief Constable and the courts had  to be operationally independent. There could not be a Sinn F&eacute;in Justice  Minister. Is it not the case that had we not done what we are doing, 1,200  police officers would have been made redundant? Imagine that in the current  context of attacks on elderly people, antisocial behaviour and domestic  burglaries. What faith would the community have in the Assembly if it walked  away and made 1,200 police officers redundant? Great progress has been made.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Earlier, the House heard a half-hearted speech from Sir Reg  Empey. He is on the wrong side of history. I believe, genuinely, because of  contacts that I have, that many Members on those Benches do not agree with the  stance that their party has taken.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>:  Does the Member agree that the fact that that party&rsquo;s only MP, Lady Sylvia  Hermon, divulged to me just last Friday during a meeting at Bangor  police station that she supports the devolution of policing and justice to Northern Ireland  represents yet another split within the Ulster Unionist/Conservative Party?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member will have a minute added to his time.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>:  Thank you, Mr Speaker. The Member makes his point well.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the leader of Her Majesty&rsquo;s Opposition, Mr David  Cameron, and the shadow Secretary of State for Northern Ireland who have shown  statesmanship in their support of what the Assembly is doing today.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It appears that, for the Conservative Party, putting the  best interests of Northern    Ireland first is more important that the  paltry position of the Ulster Unionists. Is it not now the case that a great  gulf is fixed between the Conservative Party and the Ulster Unionist Party? One  party &mdash; the Conservative Party &mdash; is supporting us, while the other is playing  cheap party politics. I wonder whether, if C S Lewis were writing today, he  would term it &ldquo;the great divorce&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Kennedy told me that he did not want to go through the  Lobby that supported the deal for all the people of Northern Ireland. I am proud to be  in a Lobby that does not include his party. There are those with the bomb and  the bullet, and there are those like the TUV with the ballot, who are seeking  to destroy Northern Ireland  and take it backwards. In fact, the only voluntary coalition the TUV currently  has is with the dissident terrorists and some elements of the Ulster Unionist  Party. That is a Lobby that nobody will want to go through.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Now that David Cameron has abandoned Sir Reg, he is, in  this case, nobody&rsquo;s fool, but that is only because he freelances.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  support the motion. Today&rsquo;s vote is important for the reasons set out by David  Ford and Naomi Long earlier. We should recognise the efforts that have been  made by the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in to get us to this point today. The road has been  tortuous, but we are here, and we should recognise and celebrate that fact.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP claims that it has always been consistent on this  issue. In fact, it has not. It has flip-flopped on the issue. When the  principles of the Department of Justice Bill were being discussed at Second  Stage, the SDLP voted no. It then tried to amend the Bill, and failed at every  occasion. At the Bill&rsquo;s Final Stage, after realising the error of its ways, it  voted yes. We have seen the SDLP do a U-turn. It has not been consistent at  all.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, the importance of what happens today is not the  vote that is about to happen shortly. It is about what happens afterwards with  delivery; it is about the Executive delivering and beginning to function on a  much stronger partnership footing than has been the case up until now; it is  about delivering on policing and justice, with better services for victims and  witnesses, more visible policing on the streets, increased integrity in  sentencing, better management and rehabilitation of offenders, and the  prevention of offending and antisocial behaviour on the streets of Northern  Ireland. It is also about getting more joined-up government and ensuring that  the Department of Justice can work with other Departments to provide real  solutions to the people of Northern    Ireland. That is the real added value and  the real prize of devolution.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is also about progress on a shared future, which is  important both in its own right and to ensure that the divisions on the ground,  which are a difficult context for policing and justice, are also addressed to make  life easier and improve our criminal justice system.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There has been a lot of comment with regard to the Alliance  Party and the post of Minister. Let me make it clear: the Alliance Party has  never chased that post. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: We  have always sought to be constructive. Of course, we are ambitious to play a  role in Government, but we are more ambitious for this society. We have not  been interested in the perks of office; we have been interested in ensuring  that any Minister in post has the ability to deliver.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Long</strong>:  The things that we were concerned about were, for example, the structures into  which it would be devolved, the kind of programme that the Minister would be  able to follow, and progress on CSI. Does the Member not agree that those are  selfless things, because they benefit whoever the Minister might be?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member has a minute added onto his time.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  thank my colleague for her intervention. It is about ensuring that the system  works, irrespective of who happens to be sitting in that office. We have now  had clarity that the Minister will be a full member of the Executive, and we  have had clarity regarding the security of programme. Already, the Hillsborough  agreement has the outlines of what a programme could be, and we have progress  on a cohesion, sharing and integration strategy. For the first time ever under  devolution, we have the two leading parties finding some agreement on the most  difficult and challenging issue facing this society. The Ulster Unionist Party,  and particularly the SDLP, should not forget that when they were in charge,  they failed miserably to produce any policy in that area. Irony of ironies; it  was only when direct rule resumed that progress was finally made. I have not seen  the document, and no doubt it contains flaws; but what is important is that it  is issued for public consultation and that there is movement after 30 months of  deadlock in the Executive.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I agree with Reg Empey that he and the Ulster Unionist  Party are entitled to vote as they wish. If they wish to find themselves on the  wrong side of history, as was mentioned, they are entitled to place themselves  there. I think that it will be a betrayal of what that party has sought to  achieve over the past number of years in bringing peace and stability to Northern Ireland,  and I think it is well out of step with the majority of people who vote for  that party, but that is for that party to defend.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">What they are not entitled to do is to peddle falsehoods  and erect straw men. For example, Minister Michael McGimpsey was on &lsquo;Good  Morning Ulster&rsquo; this morning talking about the Executive interfering with the  hypothetical situation &mdash; which I hope we do not see &mdash; of the British Army being  recalled to the streets of Northern Ireland. This afternoon, that same Minister  spoke about the Justice Minister directing the recall of the British Army. That  is complete and utter rubbish, which is at clear odds with all of the published  documents. Frankly, I am astonished that any person would display such  ignorance, or, if they do understand what is going on, actually try to peddle  things that are false.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">What they are doing is putting themselves in league with  Jim Allister and the TUV: that is the argument that he is using. It is not a  reasoned argument coming from a mainstream, moderate unionist party; it is the  argument being made by reactionary unionism. It is ironic that the Ulster  Unionist Party is now trying to move itself to the right of the DUP; something  that will no doubt confuse the electorate. The integrity of UCUNF as a project  must now be in question. How can there be a situation in which some UCUNF  candidates go to the polls in May saying that they support the Hillsborough  agreement while their colleagues say that they do not? How can a party hold  such positions on one of the most important issues facing society?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Let us vote yes today, and let us vote to make the  Executive less dysfunctional. Let us vote for a better and shared future.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I  am proud of the role that my party has played over the last three years in  securing peace in Northern    Ireland. I am proud of the fact that we  forced issues that failed to be forced before. I am proud of the fact that Sinn  F&eacute;in had to sign up to support the rule of law and order in Northern Ireland,  and now have to sign up to a British justice system, which will be administered  here back home in Northern Ireland. It is the DUP that forced that issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am proud of the fact that we forced decommissioning on to  the agenda and ensured that those matters were dealt with before Sinn F&eacute;in  could enter government. That is not something that the Ulster Unionists did: it  is something that they failed to do. The body language of the leader of the  Ulster Unionist Party today tells the story. The members of that party do not  know where they are or where they are going. They have remained consistent in  one thing: consistently getting it wrong in the decisions that they took in  1998, and they are consistently getting those decisions wrong even today. In the  past, they have said yes to everything, and now they seem to be in a land of  delusion, and do not know what to be saying yes or no to any more.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs Foster</strong>:  Is it not strange today to see the Ulster Unionist Party taking the position of  lecturing our party about stability and the dysfunctionality of the Executive,  when it was that party that brought the Executive down, not once, not twice,  but three times in the past when it was in the position to do so? Does the  Member agree that when we talk about the dysfunctionality of the Executive, one  Minister in the Executive from the Ulster Unionist Party needs to look at his  role, in particular, in relation to dysfunctionality?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member will have an added minute in which to speak.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I  fully agree with the Member. We have heard a lot of huffing and puffing, but  one thing is for sure; the Ulster Unionist Party is not going to blow the house  down. We are going ahead with the project because we are interested in  delivering peace and better community relations. We are interested in  delivering jobs and in taking Northern    Ireland forward.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Ulster Unionists have not engaged in the issue on the  basis of a principle; they have engaged in it on the basis of pettiness. They  are throwing the toys out of the pram. I suggest to the Ulster Unionist Party  that the time has come for it to grow up and show a degree of maturity. Putting  Ken Maginnis on the radio this morning &mdash; the man who introduced 50:50  recruitment to the RUC &mdash; was not the best tactic to use when talking about  policing in Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We are getting rid of 50:50 recruitment at the end of this  year, and it is interesting that the Ulster Unionist Party&rsquo;s partners in UCUNF  voted last week to retain 50:50 recruitment in Northern Ireland. That is the  policy of the Ulster Unionist Party, yet it does not know to vote for a good  deal for unionism, a good deal that the DUP delivered at Hillsborough and  before.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">This morning, I heard Mr McGimpsey speak. He has got it  wrong so often. He got it wrong when he said that there would be a Sinn F&eacute;in  Minister. We have heard the discussion on how the vote will take place. There  will be a cross-community vote. The DUP ain&rsquo;t voting for a Sinn F&eacute;in Justice  Minister, so, in the cross-community vote, he must be referring to the Ulster  Unionist Party voting for a Sinn F&eacute;in Minister. We ain&rsquo;t doing it. Mr McGimpsey  then went on to tell us &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. Allow the Member to be heard.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I  understand why the Members do not want me to be heard. They do not like what  they are hearing, because those are the facts.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McGimpsey then went on to ask whether the Justice  Minister would call in the Army if the Chief Constable required its support.  How does Mr McGimpsey not know the facts? Did he not read the agreement? Has he  not read the legislation? Has he such a misunderstanding of political life and  of parliamentarianism that he does not know what he is talking about? The Chief  Constable will have operational control of the police, not the Justice  Minister. We ensured that at Hillsborough. Moreover, judges will not be  appointed by the First Minister or the deputy First Minister. They will also  retain their operational integrity.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is interesting to hear those who are against mandatory  coalition barking and complaining outside of the House. They are, in fact,  engaged in a voluntary coalition, and by &ldquo;they&rdquo; I mean the TUV of Mr Allister;  &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann, or whatever it is called; the Real IRA; and the Continuity  IRA. They all want to pull down this House and to destroy what is happening in Northern Ireland.  We are not going for that; we are delivering progress in Northern Ireland.  We are delivering the deal and moving things forward.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I can remember very well this House being pulled down on three  previous occasions by the then First Minister, David Trimble. The DUP has never  had to threaten to pull any House down once it got into the position that it is  in. It has been Sinn F&eacute;in that has threatened to pull the House down. Trimble  pulled it down because he was not getting what he wanted, and Sinn F&eacute;in  threatened to pull the House down because it has not got what it wanted. The  DUP has stood firm for the unionist community, and it will continue to do so.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am delighted that the ugly scaffolding of the Belfast  Agreement is being removed by appointing the Minister by cross-community vote.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Time is almost up.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>: I  hope that, in future, we will move to having cross-community votes for the  appointment of all Ministers and that mandatory coalition will be completely  removed.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Time is up.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Poots</strong>:  The Ulster Unionist Party wants to ensure that there is another nationalist  Minister in the Executive.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Purvis</strong>:  By this time, all that can possibly be said about policing and justice has been  said. I shall add the Progressive Unionist Party&rsquo;s policy on the devolution of  policing and justice to the record.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In summary, my party&rsquo;s policy is: get on with it. The  Progressive Unionist Party wants devolution to be completed. That is a key step  towards political maturity in the Province and towards elected representatives  taking full responsibility for the running of our country. The PUP believes  that the devolution of policing and justice is an opportunity for leadership  and a chance to make a genuine contribution to Northern Ireland&rsquo;s political  growth and development by publicly demonstrating that Members of the Assembly  have confidence in the abilities and stability of our governing institutions,  even when it comes to highly charged issues such as policing and justice.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Devolution of policing and justice will also deliver an  enhanced level of accountability to the people of Northern Ireland and allow  more direct representation of their needs to the Departments and agencies that  are responsible for delivering the services and benefits that are part of  justice and policing powers. That is my party&rsquo;s policy, and it is a very good  one.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I wish to make a couple of brief observations about the  debate. Whoever takes up the post of Justice Minister must work to extremely  high standards of impartiality and professionalism and demonstrate that he or  she has a comprehensive understanding of all the issues that affect community  safety, criminal justice and policing. I appeal to that individual to put those  standards first and to ignore the distractions of political point-scoring,  which are always a temptation, because they would undoubtedly damage this  important development.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Many individuals worked hard to make peace and political  progress a reality, and some Members have taken personal and political risks to  get to this stage. Outside the Chamber, many individuals make important  contributions to community safety and well-being every day and work hard to  keep relationships within and between communities, as well as between the  police and communities, constructive and effective. In some ways, those men and  women have taken policing and justice into their own hands in the very best  sense of that phrase. They have filled the vacuum that was left behind as the  political process struggled towards this day. They have come up with creative,  productive and local solutions to problems that were left in the wake of the  Troubles and by the enduring impact of poverty, deprivation and isolation. I  commend those individuals for their work. I hope that we will soon see the  benefits of putting locally accountable political representatives in charge of  the services that are associated with policing and justice. I support the  motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B Wilson</strong>:  I also support the motion. Indeed, I believe that policing and justice should  have been devolved many years ago. The devolution of policing and justice is important  because it is seen by many, inside and outside Northern Ireland, as the next stage  in moving to a normal, democratic society. The Green Party has always supported  a devolved local Assembly, because we feel that that is the only way to deal  with the major social and economic issues facing the people of Northern Ireland.  Deadlock over policing has threatened the institutions, and the people of Northern Ireland  have a right to expect more responsible behaviour from their politicians than  they have seen.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">This debate has extended over many months, and, at times,  has descended into farce, with Prime Ministers jetting in and out of Belfast,  and politicians from across the globe phoning our political leaders at all  times of the day and night. Although all political parties profess to support  the devolution of policing, some of them seem to be going out of their way to  find reasons why they should not. Anything less than an overwhelming vote in  favour of the motion will seriously undermine the credibility of the Assembly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The credibility of the Assembly has been seriously eroded  in the past year. The people want the Assembly to work, but they see it  gridlocked on virtually every issue. Some Members pointed out that there is  public concern about the Assembly&rsquo;s failure to deliver and its perceived  inability to make difficult decisions. Instead of political leaders trying to  reach agreement, politics has been reduced to the traditional zero-sum game.  Every issue is presented in such a way that there must be a clear winner and  loser, leaving no room for compromise. Instead of looking for a win-win  situation in which all parties gain and therefore increase confidence in all  sides of the community, there appears to be more value placed on defeating  political rivals than on good governance. The devolution of policing and  justice is a win-win situation. All parties profess to agree that it needs to  happen and that it has widespread public support, so why do the Ulster  Unionists seem to be so keen to reject it?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The long debate on policing and justice has been littered  with red herrings as various factions try to undermine it. First, it was the  condition of resolving the parading issue. Did anyone seriously believe that  the parading issue, which has bedevilled the country for more than 200 years,  could be resolved in a few days? That was a deliberate attempt to prevent an  agreement. However, the most cynical and petty attempt to disrupt progress was  to introduce the 11-plus as a precondition. Although we all want the 11-plus  mess to be resolved, no one could seriously have expected it to be resolved in  that timescale.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Members of the Ulster Unionist Party have tried to portray  themselves as macho men who will not be bullied by Woodward, Cameron, Brown,  Bush or Clinton. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span> In fact, they are  not macho. They are seen as ineffective, and their decision to oppose the  devolution of policing and justice powers is another kick in the teeth for the  ordinary unionist voter in north Down who wants the Assembly to succeed. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B Wilson</strong>:  The discussion goes beyond policing and justice. Resolution of this issue will  be a sign that the two main parties can reach agreement on a major issue, and  it will provide hope for further progress on issues such as the economy,  education and health. That is a positive feature that can be built on.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have been active in Northern Ireland politics for more  than 40 years, and throughout that time I have always campaigned for a devolved  government that is based on power sharing. Therefore, I strongly supported the  Belfast Agreement and felt that it was a major step towards full power sharing  devolution. That devolution was to evolve and was to include the devolution of  policing and justice powers. Unfortunately, over the past few years, gridlock  and stagnation have blighted that evolution. The vacuum that was created by  stagnation has been filled by cynicism, dissident republicans and the TUV.  Today&rsquo;s motion is an opportunity to get Northern Ireland back on track, to  dispel cynicism and to undermine dissident republicans and the TUV. We have  reached a level of political maturity. The motion reinforces the Belfast  Agreement, and therefore, I support the motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister (Mr P Robinson)</strong>: Today the Assembly is being asked to complete the  process of devolution. This vote represents the end of one process and the  beginning of another. It is yet another step towards a better future for  everyone in Northern Ireland.  Progress will allow the Executive to refocus on the issues that really concern  the people of Northern    Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Whenever I approach the issue of policing and justice, I do  so on the basis of the commitments that my party made during the 2007 Assembly  elections. The promises and pledges that we made are in our manifesto, which  was authored by the party officers and endorsed by the party executive and by  the overwhelming majority of the unionist electorate. One of the co-authors of  that manifesto, which indicates that we support the devolution of policing and  justice, was one Jim Allister. With his DUP party officer colleagues, Jim  Allister co-authored that document. He voted for it in the party officer  meeting. He voted for it in the party executive. He campaigned on it for our  candidates in the country, and he voted for it in that election. Therefore,  support for the devolution of policing and justice powers goes throughout the  unionist community. At least it did, until one person changed his mind and took  some colleagues with him. I am committed to fulfilling the pledge that I made  to the Northern Ireland  electorate to devolve the powers of policing and justice in the right  circumstances. I believe firmly that we have the right circumstances.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Ulster Unionist Party has made it clear that it  supports the devolution of policing and justice powers in principle and that it  has always done so. Its approach today is more a matter of tactics or strategy  than of principle. I understand that. That is the cut and thrust of politics,  and perhaps it is a normal part of politics. However, it is a little  disappointing that some of the Ulster Unionist Party&rsquo;s criticisms of the  devolution of policing and justice powers are simply factually inaccurate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Earlier in the debate this morning and as recently as this  afternoon, the Health Minister, Mr McGimpsey, said that the Executive would  have a role to play if it were necessary to bring the Army back into Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In fact, while hyperventilating during his &lsquo;Good Morning  Ulster&rsquo; interview, he asked what would happen if a Justice Minister wanted to  bring in the Army because of the dissident threat. What would happen if the  Chief Constable said that he needed the support of the Army? Would he get the  support of the Executive? Would Sinn F&eacute;in Ministers put their hands up for it?</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I would have thought that any Member of the Assembly would  have done sufficient research for a debate to be aware of the factual position,  and I would certainly have thought that a ministerial colleague would have done  so. However, clearly he has either not done that work or is attempting to  deceive people outside the House, so let me put clearly on the record what the  position is. Paragraph 2.2 of the annexe to the national security protocol  makes it clear &mdash; I quote for Mr McGimpsey and others &mdash; that:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The police operational response, including any  request for military assistance, is a matter for the Chief Constable who has  operational responsibility and is independent&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I hope that that kills off the nonsense that has  been poured out by some elements of the Ulster Unionist Party.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr McGimpsey was not prepared to stop there. During that  interview he went on to talk some crazy claptrap about an Irish language Act,  North/South bodies and on-the-runs, while his colleague has talked about the  Army having to leave by October. Where do they get this nonsense? Who makes it  up for them? It is complete trash, and the Ulster Unionist Party knows it is  trash, which makes it all the more sorry.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Ulster Unionist Party&rsquo;s degree of desperation in trying  to blacken the process of the devolution of policing and justice causes it to  scrape around in the gutter. It is prepared to take up any old &mdash; I was going to  say &ldquo;lie&rdquo;, and I can say that. I am talking about the Ulster Unionist Party,  and it is permissible in those circumstances. That party knows that what it  said is not true and that it is simply a means of scaremongering and deceiving  those outside the House. It is the product of the manure heap. It would be  disgraceful behaviour from any Member of the Assembly, but it is all the more  unforgiveable when it comes from a Minister.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have also heard that Jim Allister, in the course of some  broadcast, has tried to add to the scaremongering by saying that there will be  a Sinn F&eacute;in Minister of Justice in 2012. If Jim Allister or the Ulster Unionist  Party want to vote for a Sinn F&eacute;in Justice Minister in 2012, they can, but the  DUP will not be doing so.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Wilson</strong>:  They would have one now.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The First  Minister</strong>: Yes. Let us be clear: the proposal that was made by the Ulster  Unionist Party for the election of the Justice Minister would have operated  through d&rsquo;Hondt, so Sinn F&eacute;in would have had a chance of taking that post after  the next election if it was to become the largest party. Happily, however, the  unionist electorate will have sufficient sense to ensure that Sinn F&eacute;in does  not become the largest party, and it will continue to support the strong and  consistent unionist party that is the DUP.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have done all that I can to encourage the Ulster Unionist  Party to support the motion. I entered the process of engagement with that  party, both at Hillsborough   Castle and afterwards, in  good faith. I wanted that party to be fully involved, and, as a result of the  Hillsborough Castle Agreement, Sir Reg Empey and Margaret Ritchie are now  chairing an important Executive working group on the functioning of the  Executive. Good work is being done by that working group. We have not been able  to reach all-party agreement on those matters as yet, but last night I offered  Sir Reg tangible evidence of a four-party coalition and a public assurance that  the DUP would not use its votes on the Executive to override the votes of any  three Ministers if they wanted a matter to be further considered. That offer was  made in the context of the UUP supporting the devolution of policing and  justice, and I am disappointed that it does not appear that that will happen.  Nonetheless, I am prepared to repeat that offer in circumstances in which the  Ulster Unionist Party and the SDLP approach Executive business in good faith.  Whatever the outcome of the vote today, we should not be distracted from doing  what is right.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That working group is making constructive proposals, and my  party has been able to offer support for the ideas that have been tabled so  far. We continue to support proposals that can improve the performance of the  Executive. However, I must point out that the current Executive are already  functioning better than their predecessor. During the current Administration,  we have taken 539 decisions, whereas the previous Administration, led by the  Ulster Unionist Party and the SDLP, took only 320. Yet those are the two  parties that talk about dysfunctionality. The current Executive function almost  twice as well as theirs. Their Executive had to be suspended on three occasions  before eventually collapsing after a fourth suspension. That demonstrates a  greater level of functionality and performance by this Executive. We have also  been able to handle more difficult decisions than the previous Administration  were able to take on board.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The basic argument being advanced by the Ulster Unionist  Party on why it is not prepared to agree to today&rsquo;s motion is that it does not  believe that the Assembly and Executive are yet ready for the powers to be  devolved. I say to Sir Reg that he should not make the perfect the enemy of the  good. I believe that it is right that we continue to improve the performance of  the Executive. It is right that we continue to improve the processes of the Executive  and the way in which we operate. As has already been seen, year on year we are  able to take more and better decisions as an Executive, and I hope that that  will continue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member for North Down Mr McFarland recalled his days as  a member of the Preparation for Government Committee when it was dealing with  policing and justice. I hope that Mr McFarland remembers what he said on that  occasion, because he did not remind the House of it. He acknowledged that there  was not sufficient confidence in the unionist community to allow the devolution  of policing and justice powers at that time. He said that it was, therefore,  not possible to agree to devolution. However, he went on to say that, should  the barrier of Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s refusal to announce its support for the police be  removed and devolution restored to Northern Ireland &mdash; both of which things have  happened &mdash; his party would believe that the time was right for the devolution  of policing and justice powers. That was the position of the Member for North Down  then. In the intervening period, he seems to have moved away from that position  for party political reasons.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Let us make no mistake about it: the Ulster Unionist Party  wants the motion to pass today. It simply wants to preen itself as though it is  against the proposition. Not only does the Ulster Unionist Party&rsquo;s partner, the  Conservative Party, want it to happen, not only does the wider unionist  community want it to happen, but it is clear from five separate polls that the  party&rsquo;s voters want it to happen. Privately, many of the Ulster Unionist  Assembly Members want it to happen as well.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is time for us all to move forward. There must be no  going back to the bad old days. Throughout history, there are times of  challenge and defining moments. This is such a time; this is such a moment. The  motion refers to the transfer of policing and justice functions. It puts back  in place the powers that the founders of the state won for us almost 100 years  ago and that were taken out of local control in the 1970s. However, the  decision that we take today is about so much more.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Some have not embraced the new era of politics and do not  yet accept the validity of the institutions, probably because they did not take  the lead role in their construction. For that reason, they have dithered,  dallied or sought to destroy or damage the institutions. I do not suggest that  anyone in the Chamber or outside thinks that the system is flawless. Any  coalition is difficult to operate, and a mandatory coalition is the most  difficult of all. The vote is a matter of completing and maintaining  devolution. It is about whether we move forward together as a society. It is  about whether we have the courage to give leadership to our community.  Leadership is not about saying, &ldquo;After you&rdquo;; it is about saying, &ldquo;Follow me&rdquo;.  Leadership is not about choosing what is easiest or what best suits our party  interests; it is about doing what is right for our people.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Northern    Ireland does not need leaders who are timid  or leaders who dither and dally. We need leaders who can stretch their  imagination. We need to push the boundaries of change and progress in Northern Ireland.  As leaders in our society, we can settle for continuing to reflect the  divisions in society, or we can work to heal those divisions. That is the  journey that my party is on, and I hope that everyone in the House will join us  on that journey. I commend the motion to the House.</p>

    <p class="H4StageHeading">Amendment of Standing Orders</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour and 30  minutes for the debate. The proposer of the motion will have 10 minutes in  which to propose the motion and 10 minutes in which to make a winding-up  speech. All other Members who are called to speak will have five minutes.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee on Procedures (Lord Morrow)</strong>: I beg to move</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">After Standing Order 44 insert &ndash;</p>
    <p class="BillAmend-AmendedText">&ldquo;44A. OFFICE OF MINISTER OF JUSTICE</p>
    <p class="BillAmend-AmendedText">(1) The office of Minister of Justice must be  filled by applying the procedures set out in paragraph 3D(4) to (8) in Part 1A  of Schedule 4A to the Northern Ireland Act 1998 within a period of seven days  beginning with the day on which &ndash;</p>
    <p class="BillAmend-AmendedTextIndent">(a) the determination mentioned in  paragraph 3D(2)(a) takes effect;</p>
    <p class="BillAmend-AmendedTextIndent">(b) the resolution mentioned in paragraph  3D(2)(b) is passed;</p>
    <p class="BillAmend-AmendedTextIndent">(c) the direction mentioned in paragraph  3D(2)(c) is given;</p>
    <p class="BillAmend-AmendedTextIndent">(d) the period of exclusion mentioned in  paragraph 3D(2)(d) comes to an end as so mentioned; or</p>
    <p class="BillAmend-AmendedTextIndent">(e) the Minister of Justice ceases to hold  office as mentioned in paragraph 3D(14), otherwise than by virtue of an  Assembly election.</p>
    <p class="BillAmend-AmendedText">(2) Where under paragraph 3D in Part 1A of Schedule  4A to the Northern Ireland  Act 1998 a person is nominated to be Minister of Justice &ndash;</p>
    <p class="BillAmend-AmendedTextIndent">(a) that nomination must take effect; and</p>
    <p class="BillAmend-AmendedTextIndent">(b) the person nominated must affirm the  terms of the pledge of office and take up the office;</p>
    <p class="BillAmend-AmendedText">within 30 minutes of the nomination, unless the  person nominated, or another member of the Assembly asks the Assembly to extend  that time limit, and gives a reason or reasons for so asking, and the Assembly  approves the extension.</p>
    <p class="BillAmend-AmendedText">(3) If a vote to fill the office of Minister of  Justice is delayed under Standing Order 28(1) in order to comply with a  petition of concern, the time periods set out in paragraphs (1) and (2) shall  not run for the period of that delay, provided that that delay is no longer  than one sitting day.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Amendments need to be made to Standing Orders as a result  of the anticipated devolution of policing and justice powers. The Committee on  Procedures has been working for some considerable time on producing Standing  Orders to facilitate the transfer, although, as with all such matters, there  has been a last-minute rush to get everything finalised. I thank the Committee  for its hard work on what were, at times, quite technical issues. I also thank  the Committee Clerk and other staff who have been extremely helpful and  hard-working.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion is one of a number that the Committee on  Procedures will bring forward before the end of the month. There is a  possibility that the Minister of Justice could be nominated before 12 April,  when policing and justice powers are due to be devolved. The Assembly needs to  have this Standing Order in place now to allow the nomination to be made and  for the Assembly to vote on it, just in case the decision is taken to appoint  the Minister before 12 April.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Northern Ireland Act 1998, which was amended in 2006  and 2009, sets out in detail the procedure for appointing a Minister of  Justice. The Act allows for Standing Orders to provide some supplementary  detail on the procedure, and the Standing Order before the House today provides  that detail. It is based on the 2009 model for the appointment of the Minister.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The new Standing Order 44A will make provision for the  nomination of the Minister of Justice following the model used for the  nomination of other Ministers. It states that the office of the Minister of  Justice must be filled within seven days of certain events taking place, such  as the determination, resolution, direction and other events as listed in  schedule 1 to the Northern Ireland Act 2009.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">5.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It also states that the nomination must take effect and  that the person who is nominated as Minister of Justice must affirm the Pledge  of Office and take up office within 30 minutes of the nomination. The period  for the appointment of other Ministers is 15 minutes, but it has been set at 30  minutes for the appointment of the Minister of Justice to allow for the  possibility of a division. As Members know, there is no vote on the appointment  of other Ministers. The title of Standing Order 44 will be expanded to make it  clear that it does not apply to the Minister of Justice.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Among the issues considered by the Committee was how a  petition of concern will impact on the nomination and taking up of office.  Members will be aware that the effect of a petition of concern is to delay the  vote by one day and turn it into a cross-community vote. In the event that a  valid petition of concern is tabled, it is necessary for the Standing Order to  make provision that the one-day delay does not impact on the seven-day and  30-minute timescales that I mentioned earlier. Accordingly, the one-day delay  will be discounted when calculating the time period within which the Minister  of Justice must be appointed. As the vote on a Minister of Justice is already  on a parallel consent basis, no further change is needed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I said, the Committee on Procedures will bring more  Standing Orders on policing and justice, and an amended Standing Order on sub  judice, to the House before the end of March. If the Assembly agrees to today&rsquo;s  motion, and to the amendments to Standing Orders that will be tabled later this  month, the Committee on Procedures agrees that the reprint of all the  amendments will be issued together to keep the amount of paper used to a  minimum. However, the revised Standing Order presented today will be available  on the Assembly&rsquo;s website from tomorrow, provided that it is agreed by Members.  I commend the motion to the House.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCartney</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Ba mhaith liom bu&iacute;ochas a ghabh&aacute;il  leis an Chathaoirleach agus leis an Chl&eacute;ireach. I thank the Chairperson for  tabling the motion and acknowledge his work in bringing the changes to Standing  Orders to the Assembly. I also want to acknowledge the work of the Committee  Clerk and her staff.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have just had an important debate on the devolution of  policing and justice powers, as indicated by the attendance in the Chamber and  the media attention. That should not undermine the important work that has been  carried out by the Committee in relation to Standing Orders. The decision that  has just been made must be reflected in Standing Orders. Indeed, without the  relevant Standing Orders, the important decision that was made five or ten  minutes ago would have no standing. I acknowledge the work that was carried out  by the Committee, the Chairperson and the Committee staff. We support the  changes to Standing Orders.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr K Robinson</strong>:  I will follow the example of Lord Morrow, who presented the Standing Orders to  the Assembly with brevity. As Mr McCartney said, we have just had an important  debate on the devolution of policing and justice powers. My party put forward  its concerns and principles. The House chose to go in another direction, and we  accept the democratic situation that flows from that. I pay tribute to the  Committee Clerk and the staff who helped us to work through the Standing Orders  in the knowledge that a Minister of Justice may be appointed one day.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The procedures outlined in the motion aim to make the  situation as clear as possible. Only time will tell whether the person  nominated for the office of Minister of Justice is taking a poisoned chalice.  Nevertheless, that person will have 30 minutes to take up office after his or  her nomination. It does not seem as though there will be a rush for the job.  However, some may be persuaded to take it on and others not. Thirty minutes  seems to be a reasonable period of time. Our concern is whether whoever is  nominated and takes up office will have the legal competence to face the  difficult tasks that lie ahead and that will be addressed by further Standing  Orders.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is nothing else that I and my party want to say,  other than the changes to Standing Orders are fairly straightforward. We  support them, and we thank all those who helped us to get to this situation.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: The  amendment to Standing Orders is the technical stage of what has been decided.  It creates the formal arrangements for the appointment of a Minister of  Justice. My party has made its views heard on the nature of the previous  motion. I will not repeat them or challenge the proposed amendment of Standing  Orders.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Permit me to say something; it will not be lengthy. This  should be a day of celebration that, at long last, the Assembly takes control  of the justice function. The SDLP has long called for that. However, it can  only be a day of very qualified celebration. In the previous debate, Mark  Durkan spoke of how the additional function could add to the cohesion of the  Executive, and I am sure that that possibility exists. However, to achieve  that, it would have been wise to have started well. We have not started well.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The comment has been made that this day, on which we make a  momentous decision on the devolution of justice powers, is the first  anniversary of the death of Constable Stephen Carroll. I heard his widow Kate  speaking on the radio this morning, as I am sure many other Members did. Hers  was a voice of wholeness and integrity. Wholeness and integrity are not what  have marked out this process. On the contrary, it has been marked out by  dishonesty and hypocrisy. That is nowhere more evident than in the designs to  appoint a Minister of Justice. The d&rsquo;Hondt mechanism of proportionality was not  accidental; it was a key element of the Good Friday Agreement. It may not last  forever, but, at this stage, it is a vital part of the architecture that holds  us together.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The party that is constantly referred to in relation to the  post of Minister of Justice has chosen to be opportunistic, rather than  principled. It should hardly need saying that a Minister of Justice should have  an instinct for justice. A prospective Minister who cannot see the point of the  Saville Inquiry into the deaths on Bloody Sunday has no such instinct.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, and this summarises what I have to say &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr I McCrea</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. Will you rule on whether this has  anything to do with what we are here to debate? The Member has just gone off on  a political rant that has nothing to do with an amendment to Standing Orders.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I am sure that the Member will want to stick to the subject.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>:  As I said, I will be brief. We are dealing with an amendment to the Standing  Orders that enable the creation of a Ministry of Justice. It is fair that I  should comment on them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, I have a very deep concern. It is that, as  we build further the superstructure of this Assembly, we simultaneously  undermine its foundations.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Neeson</strong>: I  thank the Committee Clerk and her staff, the Chairperson, Deputy Chairperson  and my colleagues on the Committee on Procedures. We have been busy preparing  for the devolution of policing and justice in recent weeks.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Today is a momentous day not only for the Assembly but for  the people of Northern    Ireland. I welcome the decision that has  been taken.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Committee has been dealing with many of the issues  related to policing and justice. The amendment to Standing Orders is necessary  for the appointment of a Minister for policing and justice. Next week, we will  deal with the appointment of a Committee for policing and justice. The  Committee on Procedures has been busy drawing up draft amendments to Standing  Orders for that. I support the motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I,  too, support the motion.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The amendment to Standing Orders puts into practice what  has been agreed by the Assembly on the way forward. They are Standing Orders to  elect or re-elect a Minister irrespective of the personality, and I regret Mr  O&rsquo;Loan&rsquo;s comments about personalities. I could make comments about the personality  of any candidate, and point out that more than one person has announced their  candidacy. I will not do that. It is not appropriate to the debate or for the  Assembly to go down to that sort of level.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The SDLP is entitled to make its argument about d&rsquo;Hondt and  the structures of the Good Friday Agreement ad nauseam, but I am not required  to agree with what is said. A cross-community vote as a means of electing a  Minister is an enhancement of power sharing; far from detracting from power  sharing, it will build confidence. How can anyone argue that a person elected  by a cross-community vote is illegitimate, because people from all backgrounds  &mdash; unionist, nationalist and other &mdash; would have shown their confidence for that  person?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr O&rsquo;Loan</strong>: I  will put the argument to the Member so that he may begin to understand why a  cross-community vote may not represent what it is purported to be and what the  Member argues it to be, namely, something that is in the best interest of the  whole community. Is it not conceivable that we could have a situation in which  there is a numerically dominant party in each section of our community, and  that it may suit each of those parties very well, for their very separate  reasons, to agree on a particular outcome despite what they say about what they  wish to achieve? They may, in the end, have agreed on a very different outcome,  and that very different outcome, sought by each party for its own selfish,  particular interests, may not in fact serve the whole community.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  That was a rather convoluted argument from Mr O&rsquo;Loan. Let me put it this way: I  support the Good Friday Agreement and the principle of power sharing. Power  sharing is what lies at the heart of the agreement, not d&rsquo;Hondt, which is a  system of proportionality; indeed, it is one of several systems of  proportionality that could have been used to determine an Executive.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are other ways that an Executive can be formed in a  power-sharing context. My party and I have argued for electing an Executive  based on parties coming together voluntarily around an agreed programme and  seeking cross-community legitimacy in the Chamber, and having a situation  whereby parties can move in and out of Government depending on the  circumstances. I qualify that by saying that all parties, particularly Sinn  F&eacute;in, should be entitled to move in and out of Government and that that system  is not designed to do down any political tradition or party. It is about  ensuring that we have good government.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That is what I would like to see, and my party will  continue to campaign for that to improve the structures. At this stage,  however, we are talking about one mechanism to elect one Minister: it is not a  Trojan Horse for a much wider reappraisal of the Executive and the way that it  is formed. That is a debate for another day. However, there is a major  deficiency in the election under d&rsquo;Hondt, because, in essence, it puts  Ministers in silos based on how a particular mathematical formula would work  out.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have seen evidence of how one party can impose its will  on the policy outcomes of a particular aspect of the Executive. For example,  the DUP imposed its will on whether we have an environmental protection agency:  it said no; four other parties said yes, but the DUP&rsquo;s view prevailed. In  education, four parties are working together to find common interim  arrangements. One party, which happens to control the Ministry, is saying no,  and its view prevails.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Power sharing is not, as the SDLP often says, about a power  carve-up. However, I think that its understanding of power sharing is  fundamentally different from mine. Power sharing is about ensuring the  collective ownership of decisions that are taken on behalf of the common good  of society; it is not about dividing society up into little fiefdoms. A  Minister from a particular party can impose his or her will on an agenda  because of the lucky dip nature of d&rsquo;Hondt. We cannot afford to have that  situation in this society.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">5.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We should not be naive about the importance of the justice  issue. It was justice issues that brought down the Stormont Parliament in 1972.  It was such a difficult issue in 1998 that it could not be devolved at that  time. It is only this afternoon that the Assembly has finally requested &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Member please draw his remarks to a close?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  Therefore &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Your time is up. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy  Chairperson of the Committee on Procedures (Mr Storey)</strong>: The debate has been  slightly longer than is usual when it comes to speeches or discussions in the  House regarding Standing Orders. I thank the Members who made contributions.  The debate recognises the importance of what has taken place in the House  today. As the Chairperson mentioned at the start of the debate, the Committee  on Procedures worked hard to prepare all the Standing Orders on policing and  justice powers so that the Assembly is ready to facilitate the transfer of  those powers. The appointment of the Minister of Justice will probably be the  first step, followed by the establishment of the justice Committee. Members can  look forward to a raft of amendments in the near future, including those to  cover the establishment and membership of the new justice Committee and various  consequential amendments.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Raymond McCartney referred to the work of the Committee  staff. I place on record my appreciation to the staff for the way in which they  have dealt with the issue to date. Ken Robinson accepted the democratic  situation in which we find ourselves in relation to the previous debate. He  commented on the office of the Minister of Justice being taken up within 30  minutes of nomination and the rationale for that period of time.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is unfortunate, and regrettable, that Mr O&rsquo;Loan took the  opportunity to make a political point. Those comments should have been made in  the previous debate. Mr Neeson and Mr Farry supported the establishment of  these Standing Orders and the changes that will flow from them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I commend the motion to the House.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Before we proceed to the Question, I remind Members that the  motion requires cross-community support.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>

    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic" style="page-break-before:always;">Motion made:</p>

    <p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="7"></a>Adjournment</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">School Newbuilds: Holywood</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The proposer of the topic will have 15 minutes in which to speak.  All other Members who speak will have approximately six minutes.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: I  see that I am speaking to a rapt House. We do not quite have the earlier  atmosphere. I suspect that today&rsquo;s Adjournment debate on the newbuild and the  education sector in Holywood may not make the headlines tonight. Nevertheless,  the issue is vital to the people of Holywood; to those who are involved with  the schools; to parents in north Down and east Belfast whose children attend the  schools; to teachers at the schools; and to everyone who has an interest  Holywood schools.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Let me say at the start that although there is some  community frustration at the lack of clarity on the way forward, the debate is  not an attempt to have a go at the Minister. That frustration pre-dates the  Minister. The debate is a sincere bid to secure some clarity and certainty for  the people of Holywood and to get some assurance that there is a positive way  forward. The debate was sparked by the Department&rsquo;s failure, in response to my  questions for written answer, to make it absolutely clear when or if things  were moving ahead. I hope that the Minister will be able to provide some  assurance on that to the House today.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the past, a lot of the focus has fallen on one  particular Holywood school, but this scheme affects four schools in the town.  It involves Priory Integrated School;  Holywood and Redburn primary schools, which, it is proposed, will be  amalgamated; and Holywood   Nursery School. The  proposals are wide-ranging in many ways. By its nature, the project is  multi-school and multi-sector; it involves the integrated and controlled  sectors. It also affects a wide range of pupils, from preschool age to school  leavers.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">All of the schools that I have mentioned have made an  outstanding contribution to education in north Down. I could quote chapter and  verse of the various school inspections that reflect on the good work that they  do. In many ways, those schools are a model for the future. Between them, they  encompass more than 1,000 children, so the issue is not inconsiderable.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, the excellent work that is being done by teachers  on issues like sustainability, the revised curriculum and the entitlement  framework is being hampered by a long-running problem in Holywood. To quote one  member of staff, the school buildings are no longer viable. That has been the  case for a long time. Indeed, I had the opportunity a while ago to visit one of  the schools, and I could see that the fabric of the building was in a very poor  state. There was a clear need for capital build.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That need has been recognised for a considerable time and  has resulted in an overall appraisal of the schools, which resulted in what is  called option 4. Option 4 is a multi-school approach that involves a newbuild  450-pupil post-primary school at the Redburn site, demolition of the old Priory Integrated  College building, the construction of  a new 21-classroom primary school at the Priory site and a new nursery school  at the Holywood Primary School site.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Thus, in effect, there would be a newbuild for Priory; the  amalgamated Holywood and Redburn primary schools, which between them have a  current enrolment of about 520, would go onto the old Priory site; and the  nursery school would move to the old Holywood Primary site. That was agreed a  number of years ago. On 1 March 2006, the then direct rule Minister, Angela  Smith, said that, as part of a package of overall investment that included  other schools such as Bangor   Grammar School, a  holistic approach would be taken to schooling in Holywood. It is worth quoting  a couple of her remarks:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;It is crucial that all our children have the best  facilities possible &hellip; My announcement today holds the promise for thousands of  children to learn, and teachers and other staff to work, in modern facilities.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Since that announcement, another block to progress  has been that the anticipation of capital newbuilds has restricted the amount  of maintenance work being done, particularly by the education board.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In June 2006, the project took a further step forward when  the then Minister Maria Eagle announced how the investment was to be procured.  At the time, all capital projects were expected to proceed under traditional  procurement procedures.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At the beginning of 2007, a problem arose when the  Secretary of State indicated that the project, which had already been approved,  needed to be reviewed in light of the Bain review. That created a degree of  delay. Nevertheless, although there were issues about numbers at Priory Integrated   College, it demonstrated  that it is oversubscribed and that it meets the Bain targets. Indeed, the lack  of newbuild is the only thing that is holding the project back.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Shortly before devolution, Maria Eagle confirmed that the  project could proceed. From that point on there has been a degree of  frustration about the lack of movement on the schools project. Although work  was scheduled to begin this year, as a result of capital-spend restrictions on  the Department as part of wider pressures on the Executive, the project is  again in question. We are seeking the Minister&rsquo;s assurance that it will go  ahead and that a definitive timeframe can be ascribed to it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Holywood children, like those in every other part of Northern Ireland,  deserve to be educated in the best possible facilities, which must be fit for  purpose and adequate. Therefore, I issue a simple plea to the Minister to give  that assurance, clarity and certainty by giving the green light to the children  and parents of Holywood so that they know that the capital-build elements of  the project will move ahead on time. I look forward to the debate and to  hearing the Minister&rsquo;s remarks. Hopefully, she will also give us her assurance.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Cree</strong>: I  apologise because I will only be able to stay for a short time. I am pleased to  see the Minister looking resplendent in the corner. I just hope that she is  listening. She always does. I also hope that she will try to move the matter on  for us.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The development of Priory Integrated   College has been under  consideration for a long time. The school does excellent work, and it is  greatly respected throughout north Down. The present scheme is innovative,  because it proposes an holistic approach and a complementary solution to  education in Holywood. I know of no other school that covers all three  education levels, which do and will work together.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Some four months ago, an economic appraisal was sent to the  relevant education and library board, but we have heard nothing since. We know  from questions to the Minister that a review of the project and the capital  spend is under way; however, we would like to know when that process will be  resolved. Many plans have been made, but they are being held up. I am sure that  the Minister has studied the matter, so I urge her to look at the merits of the  composite scheme and to give the matter a push in the right direction. The work  has been done, and the cause is a deserving one that is in the interests of  educating young people, so it deserves immediate action.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Flattery is always worth a try.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Member for North  Down for bringing the debate to the Floor. I share his concerns about the  issues that have arisen in relation to the Holywood schools. Indeed, the  problem is more widespread than the Holywood area.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In 2003, a Department of Education press release featured Holywood Primary School,  Redburn Primary   School and Priory   Integrated College  on a list of newbuilds.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In 2008, I noticed that in the Council for Integrated  Education&rsquo;s magazine, &lsquo;Learning together&rsquo;, there was a photograph of the  Minister accepting a thank-you card from the then acting principal of Priory  Integrated College, Peter McCreadie, and some pupils. However, two years later,  no sod has been cut, and there is still uncertainty about the future of the  project. There is disappointment among governors, teachers, parents, pupils and  past pupils. There is confusion in Holywood about what the future holds, and  there is confusion everywhere that newbuilds are awaited. That is not  surprising, because there is also confusion emanating from the Department.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">5.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I said earlier, departmental officials have told members  of the Education Committee on several occasions that there will be no newbuilds  in the coming year. The Minister issued a press statement saying that there  would be &pound;170 million available for newbuilds in the coming year, and she told  us that projects may or may not go ahead, depending on the ongoing review. There  seem to be contradictory messages coming from the Department, and schools that  were told that their projects would be on site in the spring of this year are  still awaiting word. Schools that are affected include, in my constituency, St  Joseph&rsquo;s Primary School, Madden; St Oliver Plunkett Primary School, Forkhill;  Dromintee Primary School; Abbey and St Clare&rsquo;s primary schools, Newry; St  Joseph&rsquo;s Primary School, Newry; and, in South Down, Carrick Primary School,  Burren. I am sure that there are many others throughout the North of Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Department of Education officials gave the Committee a  paper entitled &lsquo;Schools Estate &mdash; Capital Programme&rsquo;. According to that paper,  there was &pound;192 million available for capital works. When the Executive&rsquo;s  reduction of &pound;22 million was netted from that, &pound;170 million remained. However,  that figure is almost committed already. For example, &pound;101 million is committed  to PPP payments, &pound;17&middot;2 million is committed to existing major works that are  under way, &pound;30 million is committed to minor works, and &pound;22 million is  committed to site works and other fees.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The sum of those figures indicates that the &pound;170 million  that the Minister mentioned in her press release has already been used up by  existing schemes, and that seems to indicate that there is no headroom  expenditure for fresh, major capital projects. I do not know whether the  Minister realises that that is the case, and one wonders who is correct. Are  her officials correct, or is she correct? We need to know the answer to that  question. We need to know what exactly is happening in the review of capital  schemes and what stage it is at. When will it be finished? Is there money for  new capital projects? If so, how much money is there? When will schools, such  as those in Holywood that are awaiting newbuild premises, know for certain  where they stand?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Governors, teachers, principals and pupils of the schools  in Holywood, and the other schools that I have referred to, need to know the  facts. I hope that the Minister will be in a position today to clear up the  confusion and tell us exactly what the future holds for new capital schemes,  not just in Holywood but throughout the North of Ireland. Go raibh m&iacute;le maith  agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  declare an interest as a member of the board of governors of Priory Integrated   College and as a member  of North Down Borough Council. I thank Peter Weir for securing this important  Adjournment debate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In some respects, this is a d&eacute;j&agrave; vu experience for us all,  because we had an Adjournment debate on Priory Integrated   College in November 2007.  It occurred in the context of the go-ahead for the college having been put on  hold by the direct rule Ministers in light of the Bain report&rsquo;s  recommendations.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At that stage, we were using our good offices to ask the  Minister to move ahead with the scheme for the redevelopment of the schools in  Holywood. I was pleased, and the governors and the wider community in Holywood,  including the parents and pupils, were more delighted when in February 2008,  the Minister gave the go-ahead for the redevelopment. Since then, tremendous progress  has been made in trying to deliver on the new vision for education in Holywood.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I appreciate that we have hit some difficulties, given the  financial context in which Northern    Ireland finds itself. Indeed, Dominic  Bradley outlined some of those issues in greater detail. However, I take  consolation from the fact that the Minister has said that money is available  for ongoing capital investment. Things are not grinding to a halt, but it is  obvious that times are more difficult. Continued capital investment is  important not only for our construction industry and the wider economy but in  enabling us to continue to invest in our schools estate. Such investment is  important not only in providing a better environment for children to learn but  in ensuring that we are providing a modern infrastructure. In many respects,  the proposals for Holywood meet that vision.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is more to the situation than our merely seeking to  rebuild a number of schools. The issue is about addressing the new policy  environment, particularly the worthy policies on sustainable schools that the  Minister has articulated. It is also about area planning and collaboration  between schools through the entitlement framework. What is happening in  Holywood is a strong example of that. For example, Priory Integrated College  has taken a powerful lead in a lot of learning areas, and that is applied not  only in Holywood but down the Ards Peninsula. It is to be welcomed that  children are moving between Priory Integrated College and other schools and that  they are taking advantage of different courses and having a more rounded access  to education.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister also recognises the importance of investment  in the infrastructure. I congratulate her on visiting Priory Integrated College  in her first few weeks in office. I think that that visit was back in May 2007.  At that stage, I am sure that she could not have helped but notice the poor  state of repair of the college building, which is well over 50 years old.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The schools in Holywood are working closely with the  community. There is strong support in the community in Holywood and elsewhere  for reinvestment in the schools estate, and the community is keen to help those  students who are involved. There is also potential for North Down Borough  Council to collaborate with Priory Integrated College on the development of a  new 3G sports facility, which the community and pupils in the school could use.  That is a clear example of the potential for joined-up government in that it  ensures that we use our scarce resources to the maximum benefit, and in doing  so, help our students and the wider community with their development.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The proposal is also a rationalisation of the schools  estate. It is important that we do not lose sight of that. It is a way of  making the schools estate more efficient. We are not asking for an increase in  the level of funding to do more; we are looking for an invest-to-save  initiative. In particular, we are seeing the merger of two primary schools on  one site. Priory Integrated College is heavily oversubscribed and has to turn  people away. We could have a primary school with a roll of over 500 students,  which would make it one of the larger primary schools in Northern Ireland and  well above the Bain threshold. There is also a heavy demand for nursery places  in Holywood. We want sites to be juggled so that Priory Integrated College will  move on to the Redburn Primary School site, Redburn Primary School and Holywood  Primary School will merge on the old Priory Integrated College site, and,  finally, the Holywood Primary School site can be used for the new nursery unit.  However, we need to continue with the Priory Integrated College scheme, which  has gone to planning. Although that has been placed under a certain degree of  uncertainty, it is important that we deliver all elements of that new vision  for Holywood.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I know that the Minister is well aware of the situation. I  appreciate that she is in a difficult financial position, but I am sure that  she agrees that this project makes a lot of sense.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>:  Draw your remarks to a close, please.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  Hopefully the review will be concluded and have the right result.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>: I  welcome the opportunity to speak on this important matter, which involves  education in my constituency of North Down. I also want to say well done to my  colleague Mr Weir, who secured the Adjournment debate on this important issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The proposal to build a new 450-place post-primary school  at the Redburn site, to demolish the old Priory Integrated College building and  to construct a new 21-classroom primary school at the site, as well as a new  nursery school at the Holywood Primary School site, is considered to be the  best way forward to ensure the necessary education provision for pupils who  currently attend controlled schools in Holywood and those who are likely to  attend in the future. Therefore, it is recommended for acceptance.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As far back as March 2006, which is four years ago, the  then Education Minister Angela Smith announced a &pound;380 million investment for  school building programmes. Contained in that announcement was the acceptance  of the proposal that is the subject of this debate. It was, however, subject to  review in accordance with the Bain report. Nevertheless, in March 2007,  Education Minister Eagle stated:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;I would like the remaining assessments for the  schemes on hold completed with the relevant authorities within the next two  months to see whether there is a strong case for the schemes to proceed.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At the end of March 2007, the SEELB asked the Department of  Education for clarification on what additional information it required in order  to allow the delayed projects to be released. In May 2007, the Department  responded to the SEELB, raising concerns about the number of pupils attending Priory College.  Later in May, the board responded and the Department accepted that the project  met all the criteria set out in the Bain report.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, in September 2007, the Department raised yet more  concerns about the school&rsquo;s religious balance, whether parents supported the  move to the Redburn site, and how developments at other schools would impact on  Priory Integrated College.  The board responded later that month. In November 2007, a debate was held in  this very Chamber. Although the Minister acknowledged that the school was below  the threshold determined by Bain, she stated that if a school provided a high  standard of service, the threshold did not necessarily have to be met.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On a visit to the school in May 2007, the Minister said  that she was impressed by the good work of the principal and staff, as well as  their evident commitment to the delivery of quality education in the school.  She added that she hoped that a decision would be made on the application as  soon as possible, but that she did not have development plans for the school in  front of her. The board, however, said that the Department had sufficient  information in its possession to enable it to make a decision.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Three years later, we are still waiting. The question that  comes to mind immediately is where the money went for the plan that was  announced by Education Minister Smith in 2006. This delay is completely  unacceptable. I call on the Minister to make a decision on this application, to  let it go forward, and to find the money for it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McFarland</strong>:  I thank my colleague Peter Weir for securing the debate. Three of my colleagues  have now gone through the factual history of all of this. Mr Deputy Speaker,  you will be glad to hear that I do not propose to do the same.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I know that one of the earliest visits that the Minister  made in office was to Priory   Integrated College.  Therefore, she has been there and is in no doubt of the issues that are  involved. She will have seen how particularly useful this plan is for the  development of schools in North Down. It is neat and covers a number of schools  that might otherwise require separate builds. It made lots of sense when she  visited the college; it has made lots of sense since.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I understand that she is in difficult financial straits  with regard to a number of capital builds. However, this project is a  particularly good one. It would be a terrible pity if the hopes of people in  Holywood and North Down, the children who attend these schools and the staff  who teach them were dashed if that excellent plan were to crash at this stage.  As other colleagues have done, I ask the Minister to find the money for this  and to let it go ahead.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">5.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B Wilson</strong>:  Like my colleagues, I congratulate Peter Weir on initiating the debate. I  declare an interest as a member of North Down Borough Council. As Mr Farry  pointed out, the council is discussing potential joint efforts with Priory Integrated   College.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to come back to Angela Smith&rsquo;s statement of 1 March  2006 on investment in a school building programme. There were around 10  different schools in the South Eastern Education and Library Board, and very  few of them have got very far. Bangor   Grammar School was one of  the first to be informed that it would benefit from the programme, followed by three  schools in Holywood. In addition, as a member of the board of governors of St  Columbanus College, I raised with the Minister previously the fact that its  building project has also been delayed. I understand that it was due to be on  site last month.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Dominic Bradley put the issue into a wider context. Most of  the schemes are under review. I understand that most of them have passed their  review, but they are still waiting for a response. As has been pointed out, it  is very frustrating that that response has been delayed. I understand that  architects are being laid off by certain schools because they cannot go ahead  with the development.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As far as I am concerned, Priory Integrated   College is a special  school. My son went there when it was Holywood High School.  In 1995, it voted to become an integrated school and, at that stage, there was  concern about its long-term future. The situation was reviewed in the Bain  report. However, the college has expanded in the past few years, and its  student numbers have greatly exceeded the numbers required. There was a need  for a new school when my son went there in 1996, and now, 14 years later, the  need is much greater.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The plan that was devised to incorporate primary, secondary  and nursery schools is an ideal solution for the education facilities in  Holywood. I feel that it should be given priority if money becomes available. I  ask the Minister to consider the benefits to the community as it very much  involves providing facilities for the community. I ask the Minister to take  that into consideration when she is deciding on the allocation of the cash.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Education (Ms Ruane)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Tugaim  bu&iacute;ochas don Chomhalta as an deis seo a thabhairt dom chun pl&eacute; a dh&eacute;anamh ar na  tionscadail chaipitil at&aacute; beartaithe in Ard Mhic Nasca. &Oacute; ceapadh i mo Aire  Oideachais m&eacute;, creidim gur thug m&eacute; le tuiscint go soil&eacute;ir go bhfuil s&eacute; mar  aidhm agam oideachas ardchaighde&aacute;in a dhearbh&uacute; do gach p&aacute;iste agus duine &oacute;g  agus go bhfuil comhionannas mar chro&iacute;l&aacute;r ag gach rud a dh&eacute;anamid, lena  n-&aacute;ir&iacute;tear sol&aacute;thar scoileanna nua.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Member who secured the debate for providing the  opportunity to discuss the proposed capital projects for Holywood. Since I  became Minister of Education, I believe that I have made it clear that my  overall aim is to ensure a quality education for all our children and young  people and to ensure that equality is at the core of everything that we do,  which includes the delivery of new schools.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have made good progress in updating the schools estate  in many areas, with new schools just completed and occupied and more on site.  However, I want to take a fresh look at how we deliver capital projects. I want  to make sure that we put the right type of school in the right place to meet  the needs of children and young people, and I want to avoid making the mistakes  that were made in the past because of the lack of area planning. Since 2007, 39  major projects have been completed, and 16 projects are on site.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Most Members here will be aware that in October 2009, I  commissioned a review of current projects to validate that all are consistent  with the policy framework that I am putting in place to ensure that we meet our  statutory duties on equality and targeting on the basis of identified need. The  policies driving that review include, to name but a few: sustainable schools;  the revised curriculum; the entitlement framework; Every School a Good School;  the revised literacy and numeracy strategy; the early-years strategy; the  special educational needs review; an inclusion review; and the review of  Irish-medium education. I will reiterate briefly some of the detail of those  policies and highlight their importance to our education system as we seek to  ensure that the right capital projects are delivered.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The sustainable schools policy is crucial to improving the  system for all our children, because the education system &mdash; as Members will  have heard me say on many occasions &mdash; is letting down too many children. We  need to ensure that all our young people get a first-class education,  regardless of their background or where they live.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">To that end, the policy sets out six criteria for helping  to assess the viability of schools. Those criteria are both quantitative and  qualitative. Consideration will be given to the educational experience of the  children; the financial position; leadership and management of the school;  accessibility; enrolments and links with the community; and, above all, the  provision of a quality education. The latter must be the overriding  consideration. Obviously, equality needs to be at the core of all that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">From September 2010, all pupils in our schools will be  taught through the revised curriculum, which has at its core a focus on  knowledge and on the skills that pupils need to apply that knowledge in  everyday situations. It concentrates on raising standards in reading, writing  and maths, and on preparing young people for all aspects of life and work,  while giving schools and teachers greater flexibility to deliver lessons in a  way that suits pupils&rsquo; needs.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have also recently introduced Every School a Good School:  a policy for school improvement to raise standards in all schools across the  North of Ireland. That is a pupil-centred policy with equality and improvement  at its heart. It sets out my Department&rsquo;s commitment to raising standards and  reducing educational underachievement. Every child should, and must, have  access to high-quality education in a school setting that is characterised by  good leadership, excellent teaching and strong links between school, parents  and communities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I know that there are good schools that are already doing  what is advocated in Every School a Good   School, and I do not seek  to detract from that. However, there are still too many schools where pupils  are not reaching their full potential. I believe that all schools are capable  of improvement, even the good ones.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The strategy for raising achievement in literacy and  numeracy is a vital component of my Department&rsquo;s approach to improving  standards, thereby assisting young people to acquire the literacy and numeracy  capabilities that allow them to realise their full potential.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The review of Irish-medium education includes a specific  recommendation regarding the develop&shy;ment of Irish-medium post-primary provision.  I have accepted that recommendation in full recognition of the fact that the  sector has grown steadily at primary level over the past number of years,  resulting in increased demand for Irish-medium post-primary provision. It is my  sincere intention to make Irish-medium education available at all levels to the  parents and children who wish to avail themselves of it. The Irish-medium  review also identified the issue of poor accommodation in many Irish-medium  primary schools, and I am looking into that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">All the policies that I have detailed are intertwined and  designed to ensure the best possible outcomes for all. Given the financial  constraints that we face, I am sure that Members will agree that it is crucial  to get the investment right. I look forward to support from all the parties in  the House for getting further resources, because we are all aware of the  importance of school builds. That matter affects all our constituencies. It is  against those policies and the wider financial context that all proposed  capital projects are being assessed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Progress of the capital projects for Priory  Integrated College,  Holywood Primary   School and Holywood   Nursery School will be  dependent on the outcome of the review. The outcome will inform the development  of a more strategic approach to capital investment decisions and management of  the schools estate. Projects will then be prioritised for progression in the  coming financial year, taking account of available resources.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">T&aacute; &aacute;thas orm go raibh deis agam an tionchar a mh&iacute;ni&uacute; go  hioml&aacute;n a bheidh ag na beartais chomhl&aacute;ntacha ar east&aacute;t na scoileanna agus an  d&oacute;igh a gcruth&oacute;idh sol&aacute;thar scoileanna nua c&oacute;ras n&iacute;os fearr oideachais.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am pleased to have had the opportunity to explain fully  how the complementary policies will impact on the schools estate and how the  delivery of the new schools will create a better education system.</p>
