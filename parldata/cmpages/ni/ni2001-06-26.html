                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have received notice from the Minister of
                Agriculture and Rural Development that she wishes to make a
                statement on foot-and-mouth disease.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Agriculture and Rural
                Development (Ms Rodgers):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is now several weeks since I last
                addressed the Assembly on the subject of foot-and-mouth disease.
                As Members will doubtless be aware, the position — in Northern
                Ireland at least — has continued to improve during that time.
                There have been no further outbreaks of the disease; there are
                no suspected cases at this time; and the serology testing we
                have been carrying out on sheep demonstrates that the virus is
                not, and has not been, generally present in sheep outside the
                flocks which we detected and dealt with.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In recognition of that, the European Union
                granted regional foot-and-mouth disease status to Northern
                Ireland on 5 June. That decision has allowed the immediate
                resumption of exports of live pigs and certain products from
                susceptible animals — excluding beef, because of BSE. Sheep
                will again be eligible for export with effect from 1 July.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am continuing to look at the remaining
                controls on the agriculture sector with a view to dismantling,
                or at least relaxing, them as the disease situation permits. I
                have particular concerns about the plight of the livestock
                marts, which remain closed. My intention is to permit the marts
                to reopen on a phased basis and under a suitable disease control
                regime as soon as it is safe for them to do so. This process
                should be able to start in the next few weeks.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Looking beyond the farming sector, the
                improvement in Northern Ireland’s foot-and-mouth disease
                situation is such that two weeks ago the Executive was able to
                issue revised guidelines allowing the reopening of land and
                property which had, until then, been closed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is hoped that we will be able to advance
                in the next few days by allowing some of the remaining controls
                and measures to be stepped down, while continuing to protect
                Northern Ireland against the threat of foot-and- mouth disease.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The disease situation in Northern Ireland
                stands in stark contrast to that in Great Britain, where
                foot-and-mouth disease continues to occur. This difference means
                that the controls that I imposed on the movement of livestock,
                products and people from Great Britain will have to remain in
                place until the picture there improves significantly. However, I
                have agreed that horses can again be imported from Great
                Britain; this is a change which I know the industry was keen to
                see.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the risk decreases, I intend to scale down
                the effort that the Department has been devoting to control of
                the disease. I will redirect the resources released by this move
                to deal with other pressures.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Agriculture and Rural
                Development was testing about 10,000 sheep blood samples a day
                at one stage in the serology testing programme that I referred
                to earlier. Over 300,000 sheep or 10% of the Northern Ireland
                sheep population have been tested under that programme. That is
                a huge effort by any standards. The serology testing was carried
                out in those areas that were judged by the Veterinary Service to
                pose the greatest risk. The work is labour-intensive, and,
                bearing in mind resource implications and competing priorities,
                I am now exploring what further testing may be required for
                epidemiological purposes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The dedicated foot-and-mouth disease helpline
                that I set up at the start of the crisis was no longer
                fulfilling the purpose for which it was established, so I closed
                it with effect from Friday 22 June. However, the departmental
                helpline and the special arrangement that I made for handling
                queries from Members are still available.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no further need for me to make
                regular statements to the Assembly as I have done since the
                disease first hit Northern Ireland in February. Therefore this
                is the last such statement unless the disease situation dictates
                otherwise.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is to be hoped that Northern Ireland is
                now coming towards the end of the foot-and-mouth disease crisis.
                It is therefore crucial that the Department of Agriculture and
                Rural Development refocus its energy on other important
                objectives. In the next six months, as the problems associated
                with foot-and- mouth disease recede, I will concentrate on a
                recovery plan for the agrifood sector, taking account of both
                national developments of interest to Northern Ireland and the
                outcome of the work of the vision group. That group met again
                yesterday, and its work will continue over the summer. I expect
                to receive a report from the group in September which will take
                account of issues arising from foot-and-mouth disease.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Further work will be done during the final
                phase of foot-and-mouth disease, but the Department’s handling
                of the outbreak will be scrutinised through external review.
                This will dovetail with any equivalent review in
                Great&nbsp;Britain, and the Department will wish to liaise with
                the authorities in Dublin to ensure that cross-border lessons
                are also taken into account. I will make a further announcement
                on that in due course.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will also turn my attention to achieving
                low-incidence status for beef exports. The difficulties that
                Northern Ireland still faces on that front should not be
                underestimated. Confidence remains low in Europe, and much will
                depend on the outcome of the Department’s testing regime as it
                moves again into top gear to reduce the number of tests
                undertaken for foot-and- mouth disease purposes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Success in that endeavour will depend on
                farmers’ cattle identification and herd records being in good
                order. The Department of Agriculture and Rural Development will
                give whatever help it can, but ultimately Northern Ireland
                farmers must demonstrate that they have reliable herd records
                and cattle traceability. I urge farmers to turn their attention
                to that as soon as possible.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Programme for Government introduced the
                concept of rural proofing in Northern Ireland. Over the coming
                months we need to flesh out that idea so as to appreciate how
                the concept will work.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Department will presently roll out the
                rural development strategy and its proposals for the Peace II
                programme, which will include consultation. I look forward to
                seeing the proposals that will emerge from the community.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Together with the North/South Ministerial
                Council, the Department will be developing issues with a strong
                North/South dimension. In particular, animal health will be the
                focus of further work. We also need to work with the authorities
                in Dublin to agree the most productive approach to the reform of
                the common agricultural policy (CAP), so that I can integrate it
                in the development of the United Kingdom negotiating stance.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have been giving much thought to our
                forestry policy in recent months. I hope to present our draft
                proposals to the Committee and the Assembly after the policy
                review.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have attempted to set out my main strategic
                objectives for the months ahead. Additionally, a massive amount
                of work is daily being undertaken by the Department. As we move
                out of the foot-and-mouth disease crisis, staff will be
                returning to normal duties. We will pursue all the objectives in
                the Department’s business plan with our customary energy. In
                particular, we must step up our efforts in tuberculosis and
                brucellosis control, and we must tackle the substantial backlog
                of BSE testing in cattle.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I assure the House that as well as focusing
                on relevant agrifood sector matters, I will be paying
                considerable attention to the problems in the fishing industry.
                At present, those problems are considerable, and more work must
                be done before the crucial Fisheries Council meeting in
                December.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to end on a cautionary note. The
                fact that we escaped the epidemic that occurred in GB was due to
                a great deal of hard work and sacrifice by everyone in the
                industry. It would be disastrous if, having gone through all
                this, we were to drop our collective guard prematurely and
                foot-and-mouth disease were to recur here. Although we are
                relaxing our controls in a proportionate way in response to the
                improvement in our situation, it is important that we continue
                to adopt the fortress mentality that has served us so well. The
                foot-and-mouth virus is still circulating just a few miles away,
                across the Irish Sea. The controls we have set up at ports,
                airports and farm gates will continue to be necessary for some
                time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will end by expressing my personal
                gratitude to the Assembly for its assistance and support during
                the foot-and-mouth disease crisis. I also want to express my
                gratitude to the industry and to the public for their
                co-operation and forbearance over the past four months. The fact
                that we managed to escape the worst of the outbreak was due to
                the co-operation of Government, industry and the public. It has
                been a difficult period for all of us, and the effects of
                foot-and-mouth disease will be with us for some time. It was
                gratifying that we were able to work together so effectively in
                the industry’s best interests.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Agriculture and Rural
                Development Committee (Rev Dr Ian Paisley):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is certainly gratifying that we do not
                have this disease to the same extent as they do in the rest of
                the UK. Does the Minister agree that, given the serious
                announcements and fresh outbreaks in various parts of the UK, we
                need to be even more careful in guarding our ports as the summer
                months approach? As we have been able to stop the disease from
                getting a grip on Northern Ireland, it would be terrible if,
                given the summer traffic, there were to be any let-up in the
                very successful way that the ports have been guarded. Perhaps
                the Minister would like to comment on that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Can the Minister tell us how much money has
                been paid in compensation during this time, and how much remains
                to be paid? What were the findings as regards fraud in this
                matter? I understand that the permanent secretary made a report
                on this matter in which he cited a view among officials that a
                strong stand had not been taken on this issue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like the Minister to comment on why
                officials thought that. If everything had been all right then
                there would have been no need for that statement to have been
                made. That issue needs to be clarified.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Dr Paisley for his remarks and
                questions. I agree with Dr Paisley that we need to maintain
                precautionary measures and vigilance at the ports, particularly
                as the holiday season approaches and more visitors come here. We
                will do that; we will make sure that every precaution is taken
                at the marinas as well.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have paid out £7 million so far in direct
                compensation, and £0·5 million remains to be paid.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fraud is being investigated in the same way
                as in other years. The first advance payments of the sheep
                annual premium (SAP) scheme are, as a rule, paid in early July.
                Farmers who have submitted subsidy claims which require
                clarification, further information or which are being queried,
                will receive letters from the Department of Agriculture and
                Rural Development to that effect in mid-July.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Paisley may be aware that information on
                the culls in Northern Ireland, GB and the Republic has been
                sought by the European Union. The information will be supplied
                in the second half of July, when it is complete.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report by the permanent secretary of the

                allegation made by a Member of the Assembly that a blind eye was
                being turned to fraud in south Armagh. The permanent secretary
                had an investigation carried out, and he then made a report to
                me. The summary at the end of that report states:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;In conclusion, therefore, this review

                turned to fraud and that normal procedures will apply in
                relation to subsidy claims.&quot;</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for her statement and
                welcome her intention to permit the reopening of livestock
                markets in the next few weeks. In relation to the live export of
                sheep from 1 July, some buyers have expressed the concern to me
                that they will be unable to avail of the opportunity to get
                sheep away for export. In the light of that, we could do with
                buyers from the Irish Republic buying sheep at the collection
                points that we have already set up. Our farmers would therefore
                be able to avail of the higher price for sheep over 21 kilos. It
                would be a good idea for the buyers to purchase the sheep at the
                collection points rather than to go around the various farms.
                Perhaps the Minister could give that her earliest consideration.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The question is that we want the Minister to
                consider the proposal that buyers should come to the collection
                points to buy sheep.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Rodgers:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As usual, Mr Armstrong is trying to push the
                door a little bit further in. I established collection points at
                marts to facilitate the farmers who had difficulty, for example,
                in bringing three or four lambs the whole way from County Down
                to Derry. Those collection points meant that farmers could bring
                their fat lambs there, which was convenient.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Armstrong seems to be suggesting that
                farmers, from the South or elsewhere, should be able to come to
                these collection points and buy sheep. I received a letter from
                him on the subject this morning, but I have not had time to
                study it. I will consider that possibility, but it looks
                suspiciously like opening the marts for sheep sales. I must
                inform him that, although I am looking seriously at the question
                of reopening the marts — because I recognise the problems of
                the mart owners and farmers — the first step will be to open
                them for cattle sales. Sheep sales will happen later, because we
                are still somewhat nervous of the problems with the flock. I
                will be guided by advice from veterinary experts. I will examine
                Mr Armstrong’s suggestion, but I am not holding out much hope
                that it will be possible to implement it.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGrady:</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for her &quot;state of
                the agricultural nation&quot; statement. I am delighted that the
                threat of foot-and-mouth disease is receding. I welcome the
                announcement that the Department will focus its attention on
                other problems affecting the industry, not least in fishing and
                forestry, which are germane to my constituency.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like the Minister to explain some
                points in more detail. We welcome the opening of the livestock
                marts, but will she tell us which animals will be allowed to be
                processed through the marts, in what order and when?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition, is the Minister aware that there
                is a charitable fund, called the Addington Fund, which assists
                farmers in GB? Although it is a private charitable fund, it
                receives public and private donations. Can she ensure that
                Northern Ireland farmers have access to it to obtain funding
                from it?</p>
                <b>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope to open the marts for cattle and pig
                sales in the next few weeks. The best guesstimate that I can
                make for this is mid-July. At that stage, they will not be open
                for sheep.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Addington Fund is a private fund for the
                assistance of farmers. I understand that Northern Irish farmers
                have already received some assistance from it. Because it is a
                private fund, it is not a matter for Government. However, I
                understand that it has been operating through the Ulster Farmers’
                Union and the Northern Ireland Agricultural Producers’
                Association (NIAPA). It is outside the remit of Government, but
                it has provided some help to farmers who were beleaguered and
                required financial assistance.</p>

                I welcome the Minister’s lengthy statement, which mentioned
                future plans and the vision group. The possibility of the marts
                reopening for cattle sales in mid-July will be welcomed in
                Fermanagh, which exports nearly all its cattle.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What is being done to ensure that we have
                learned the lessons of foot-and-mouth disease? What action has
                the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development taken to
                ensure that the British Government put in place measures to
                prevent future outbreaks which, as in this case, could be
                followed by the movement of the disease into Ireland?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I expect that the British Government will
                carry out their own review of the episode to find out how it
                happened and what lessons can be learned from it. There will be
                a ministerial meeting next Wednesday between the regional
                Ministers and the new Minister of the Environment, Food and
                Rural Affairs, Margaret Beckett. I have no doubt that those

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A subgroup of the vision group is looking at
                the lessons we can learn from foot-and-mouth disease and will
                report to me in September. I intend to establish a review of the
                crisis outside the Department.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Breeding animals that come in from the
                Republic must have veterinary certification. That matter must be
                discussed, and my officials are in discussions with officials in
                the Republic about all matters, including that one.</p>

                answering questions on foot-and-mouth disease, she will be here
                to talk about animal health, forestry, fisheries and rural
                proofing. I look forward to hearing some detail on those points,
                which have been sadly neglected in recent months.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What is the full remit of the external review
                of the Department’s handling of foot-and-mouth disease?
                Specifically, what is the earliest date that it will consider?
                Will it include, in particular, the work of the Department of
                Agriculture and Rural Development in inspecting the ports before
                the diagnosis of foot-and-mouth disease in GB in February? The
                issue is not just the handling of the disease when it arrived,
                but the failure to prevent its arrival.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister mentioned the resources for the
                serology testing and hinted that it was to end soon. What is the
                present basis — not the historic pattern — on which the
                serology tests are being carried out? How are farms selected for
                that testing? What is the level of testing? Has she plans to
                wind it down soon?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have just announced the external review,
                and I have not looked at it in detail. The details have yet to
                be decided, but I will obviously want it to take account of all
                aspects of foot-and-mouth disease. It would be a useless
                exercise if we looked at only some parts of it. We will look at
                all the aspects, including the precautions at the ports that Mr
                Ford mentioned.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are now in the final stages of the
                serology testing and strategic targeting of other areas that we
                want to investigate. We have finished testing in the Sperrins,
                the Mournes and the Glens of Antrim, which were the areas of
                greatest concern. We are continuing to test in the lowland areas
                and will take a significant number of samples there. I cannot go
                into every detail as I am not a veterinary expert, but we test a
                significant number of samples. In the areas that I first
                referred to, we have sampled 10% of sheep. Considering there are
                three million sheep in Northern Ireland, that is a large number.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am aware that the 20-day holding period
                causes difficulties, but I must also remind the House that the
                free and frequent movement of sheep in the initial stages of the
                disease created a huge problem. It was virtually impossible for
                us to identify where the virus was present, and our reaction to
                it was delayed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We will consult the industry and all
                stakeholders on how we deal with the problem of moving sheep.
                Sometimes I fear that when we are out of the woods and things
                begin to look better, people will forget how bad it was and how
                bad it could have been. We cannot ignore the fact that the very
                frequent movement of sheep made it difficult for us to establish
                where they were or where the infection was.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In answer to Mr Kane, I am aware of the
                problem, and we will look at what can be done. Whatever we do,
                we must ensure that we are not faced with such a problem again
                and that the industry is protected. A balance must be found
                between the need to enable the industry to operate and the need
                to ensure that we are not threatened by another disease with
                such negative implications for agriculture.</p>

                move on from foot-and-mouth disease and return to achieving
                low-incidence BSE status. That seems to have assumed some of the
                characteristics of the quest for the Holy Grail.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am sure the Minister is aware that the new
                and more rigorous European Union beef labelling regulations come
                into force in January 2002. I understand that the Department of
                Agriculture and Rural Development does not intend to introduce
                them into Northern Ireland legislation until at least the end of
                the first quarter of 2002.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Minister agree that this new regime
                of labelling should eradicate the possibility of imported beef’s
                being in any way labelled as Northern Ireland produce? That
                possibility could compromise the traceability scheme. Can the

                the success of the regionalisation bid, my officials will meet
                their counterparts next Wednesday to review any issues regarding
                the resumption of trade between Northern Ireland and the

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.
                I welcome the Minister’s statement and recognise the part
                played by her and her Department in curtailing foot-and-mouth
                disease. Turning to cattle traceability and identification, the
                need for records to be in good order and the achievement of
                low-incidence BSE status, may I suggest that the Minister
                undertake to change the ear-tagging and identification scheme?
                The Minister will be aware that Northern Irish beef is tagged as
                being UK sourced. I propose that when marketing Northern Irish
                beef in future, the UK tag should be changed to a Northern Irish
                tag. Does the Minister agree?</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Rodgers:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Mr Murphy for his question. We do not
                have any control over being part of the member state of the
                United Kingdom. We might wish it to be otherwise; I might wish
                it to be otherwise, and so might Mr Murphy, but the fact is that
                the member state is the United Kingdom, and European regulations
                dictate that ear tags must show that beef is sourced in the
                United Kingdom. Cattle can be classed as belonging to the
                Republic of Ireland or to the United Kingdom, and in our case,
                whether we like it or not — and some of us do not like it but
                we must accept it until there is consent for change — we are
                in the United Kingdom. Therefore the ear tags must show that.
                However, there is nothing to prevent the industry here, when
                marketing its beef and produce, from agreeing on a marketing
                label that would be different from the ear tags. The label could
                suggest something such as the food island initiative or Irish
                beef, because Irish beef — whether from North or South — is
                a marketable commodity. There is nothing to prevent private or
                commercial concerns from identifying beef with their own label
                for marketing purposes. However, under the EU regulations we do
                not have a choice about what is on the tags.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Minister’s staunch defence of
                the Union. The Minister might now be a Member of Parliament as
                well, had she picked a different constituency. With her
                popularity in the farming community, that would have gone down

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I congratulate the Minister and her

                now receive a more upbeat and positive statement from the
                Minister. The Minister has said that certain measures will
                remain in place. Can she then tell the House if she is giving
                the green light to a return to normality for sport and tourism
                in the Province? Is the Minister content that those measures are
                adequate to protect Northern Ireland at this time? Has she made
                any progress towards consequential compensation, and how often
                does she raise that matter with the Government?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With whom is she raising the matter, and what
                does she expect the response to be? What consequential
                compensation does she expect to secure for those who have been
                drastically affected by the ravages of foot-and- mouth disease?</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Rodgers:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Mr Paisley for his questions. First,
                I would like to make it clear that I was not defending the
                Union; I was reluctantly accepting the status quo because we
                recognised the principle of consent in the agreement that we
                signed. However much I will try to get consent for what I want,
                I accept the status quo for the moment. I hope that we can
                continue to work together until we convince people like Mr
                Paisley that we might be better off in an all-Ireland state, a
                member state which we often look to with envy in our dealings
                with Europe.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to a green light for a return to
                normality in sport, the Executive’s guidelines should be
                amended shortly to give a qualified green light. We are not over
                the threat from GB, but we are over the threat in the North.
                Given that fact, in the next week we will issue further
                guidelines that will enable people to take a common-sense
                approach to angling and other sports. If a person has not been
                in contact with live animals, he will be able to go ahead with
                the sport. We will be issuing clear guidelines in the next few
                days.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Consequential compensation is being dealt
                with by the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First
                Minister and the Department of Finance and Personnel.
                Discussions about that are ongoing with the British Government.
                We will be meeting the regional Ministers and Mrs Beckett next
                week. I will be anxious to hear what the position is, and I will
                be pressing for Northern Ireland to get a fair share of any
                consequential compensation being considered by the Treasury.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr J Wilson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that the Minister will not mind my
                saying that we do not expect to hear from her again on this
                matter for a long time. I share other people’s concerns about
                the marts. Will the Minister assure me that someone will see the
                process through to the end if the reopening of the marts is
                going to be phased and is not going to begin for some weeks?
                Some mart owners may not be back in business until the autumn. I
                hope that she shares my concern that the person at the end of
                the process will be able to reopen the marts, because they have
                all been closed for a long time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The angling estate that is managed by the
                Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure is open, with the
                exception of one or two difficult locations. However, will the
                Minister have regard for the fact that our rivers are still
                inaccessible? Even if she announced today that the situation
                were about to change, there would still have to be lengthy
                consultation between angling clubs and farmers that might go on
                into the autumn. I hope that it rains during the summer,
                although others will have a different view, and they will
                probably get their way.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the water levels are very low, the
                slightest import of pollutant can be catastrophic. Anglers are
                the best policemen of the rivers, and the sooner we get them
                back out on the rivers where they can watch out for pollutants,
                the better. I hope that the Minister will bear that in mind.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Rodgers:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Mr Wilson for his comments and for
                telling me that he hopes not to be hearing from me for some
                time. I hope that he is right.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A phased process for reopening of the marts
                means that, by necessity, the introduction of sheep sales into
                the marts will be at the end of the queue rather than at the
                beginning. I said in response to Mr McGrady’s question — and
                he is not here at the moment — that the reopening of the marts
                would take place by mid-July. That might have been a little
                optimistic. It will probably be closer to the end of July,
                although it is difficult to be precise. Cattle sales will be the
                first to be introduced, then pigs and, further down the line,
                sheep. Members will understand the reason for that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to rivers not being accessible to
                anglers, in the Executive’s most recent guidelines I stated
                that angling could proceed again provided that anglers were not
                in contact with farm animals. That will clearly have to be
                discussed with the angling clubs and local farmers. It is a
                matter of applying common sense, and I will be issuing further
                guidelines.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the Strule River area, for instance —
                which I have come to know fairly well in the last four or five
                weeks — there are many angling clubs. Only a very small
                portion of the river crosses farmland. For the most part, access
                to the river does not involve going through farmland or contact
                with farm animals. Common sense is required, and I take the
                point that anglers would be the first to become aware of
                pollution. It is very important that they can alert people to
                that.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My question is closely related to the
                concerns of other Members. The Minister is only too aware that
                our fledging rural tourism industry has, in general, been
                devastated by foot-and-mouth disease. Can the Minister assure

                plug into that and that local communities, councils and private
                enterprise come forward with projects that can boost, improve
                and exploit the natural resources that we have in Northern

                am very anxious to ensure that rural tourism is supported and

                especially the section on the opening of the livestock markets.
                She said that, in the short term, this will involve cattle only
                and that sheep will be at the end of the queue. What is the
                Department’s position on the sale of rams, as the season for
                sales is approaching? It takes six to eight weeks for those
                planning the sales to organise catalogues, and several people
                have asked me about this. Can the issue be examined, and perhaps
                dealt with first, if the sale of sheep is to be pushed to the

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the encouraging news we have had
                this morning. I am reassured that we are still keeping up our
                guard against the external threat. Having reached this stage, it
                is very important that we do not now suddenly import the dreaded
                threat once again.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Tyrone and Fermanagh have less favoured areas
                in greater acreage and queues of livestock for grazing — and
                we are well into the grazing season. Under the phased reopening
                of the marts, I appeal for the marts of Enniskillen, Clogher and
                Omagh, which are modern marts able to cater for any necessary
                health regime, to be given first-phase priority.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My second point relates to the traceability,
                credibility and promotion of our meat. We are now looking at how
                we can market our product in the future, and one of the greatest
                lessons we have learnt is about our inability to trace sheep
                accurately — look at the case of the 60 missing sheep. We now
                have a regime that is traceability proof, as far as is humanly
                possible. Farmers should be encouraged to ensure 100% accuracy.
                By the same token, there should be a penalty on those who thwart
                accurate traceability. It is very important to encourage farmers
                to help themselves, but we are asking the Minister to help them
                with marketing so that we can restore confidence to an industry
                that has been debilitated for six years.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In response to Mr Gibson’s other point
                about effective tracing, I agree that that is important. One of
                the problems we have had in trying to stay ahead of the disease,
                particularly in the initial stages, and since, has been the
                absence of effective tracing mechanisms for sheep, and we will
                have to establish them. In doing this we will take account of
                the views of the vision group and our external review and in
                consultation with the industry. I take the Member’s point.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also agree that finding effective ways of

                to see our moving ahead. The issue will be discussed, and there
                will be consultation with the farming unions and the industry.
                We will take on board the proposals from the vision group and
                the findings of our review. I agree that we need to look at

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Parity also enables us to use the same
                computer system in Northern Ireland and Great Britain for child
                support and social security, thus making it cost-effective.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, parity is a two-edged sword. Rights
                to benefits must be matched by obligations to society. It is
                right that we should enjoy the same rights and benefits as
                people in Great Britain; however, it is equally right that we
                play our part in tackling the problem of benefit fraud.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Parity covers not only the content of the
                legislation but also the timing of its implementation. To ensure
                that the proposals are implemented at the same time as in
                Britain, the necessary powers must be available as soon as
                possible. The UK spends over £100 billion each year on social
                security. It is our duty to make sure that the system is secure
                from both fraud and error, so that the right money goes to the
                right people. That duty is reflected in the Department’s
                objective to reduce losses from fraud and error in social
                security benefits by 5% per annum over the spending review
                period April 2001 to March 2004.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the United Kingdom, social security fraud
                costs at least £2 billion a year. That is clearly unacceptable,
                and we are determined to play our part in stemming the flow. The
                vast majority of people who claim benefits are honest, and it is
                unfair to them and to the taxpayers who foot the bill that a
                minority is cheating the benefits system.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A wide variety of fraud is perpetrated
                against the system, ranging from the opportunist, such as the
                person who does not tell us that he has started to work, to the
                highly organised criminal gangs involved in counterfeiting or
                stealing instruments of payment and running false identity
                fraud.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Grabiner Report on the informal economy
                contained recommendations to combat benefit fraud. This Bill
                seeks to combat benefit fraud by putting many of those
                recommendations into action.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Before turning to the details of the Bill’s
                proposals, I will set them in context by illustrating the broad
                nature of social security fraud. Fraud takes place when people
                lie about their circumstances to gain benefit. There are many
                types of fraud. One is working and not declaring earnings,
                including those of a partner. Commonly this happens when a
                person claims to be unemployed but is working. Another type
                involves undeclared capital, when a person either fails to
                inform the Department of his assets or misrepresents their true
                value.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A third involves undeclared income from other
                sources. An example of this is where a person has unearned
                income or income from a private pension scheme. There is fraud
                involving family circumstances, where a person does not declare
                a partner who is living with him. Then there is residency fraud,
                where a person claims to reside at one address, but, in fact,
                lives at another. Identity fraud involves the hijacking of a
                real identity, or the creation of a false one, although with
                tougher checks on claims, the latter is becoming much more
                difficult.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is estimated that in Northern Ireland
                about £73 million per annum is lost from public money due to
                benefit fraud.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Madam Deputy Speaker [Ms Morrice] in the
                Chair).</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">11.30 am</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fraud is not a small-time activity or a
                victimless crime, although it is often portrayed as such.
                Rather, it is more often a planned, calculated act, and it
                diverts a great deal of public money away from other objectives.
                The provisions of the Bill will help to reduce that loss, both
                through prevention and earlier detection, using the powers to
                acquire data from the private sector; and through deterrence,
                using the powers to remove benefit from persistent benefit
                offenders and the swift, effective punishment of collusive
                employers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Turning now to the measures proposed by the
                Bill, one of the key recommendations in Lord Grabiner’s report
                on the informal economy was a power to take benefits away from
                people who persistently abused the benefits system. Rights to
                benefits must be matched by obligations to society. If we are to
                restore the public’s confidence in the social security system,
                we must deter hard-core benefit cheats by getting across a
                strong message that they cannot repeatedly commit fraud and
                still expect to be able to claim benefit again as if nothing had
                happened. For the vast majority of benefit cheats, their first
                conviction is their last, because the process of being
                interviewed under caution, appearing in court, being sentenced
                and finding themselves named in their local paper is an
                extremely salutary experience. However, there are hard-core
                cheats who simply refuse to learn their lesson and continue to
                offend. They must be made to realise that they cannot abuse the
                benefit system and steal from the rest of society with impunity.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This Bill provides that those convicted of
                benefit fraud will be warned that a further conviction within
                three years would mean that they could lose benefits for a
                period of 13 weeks. This would happen when they defrauded
                virtually any social security benefit. These are known as
                disqualifying benefits. However, the sanction itself will apply
                to a smaller range: the sanctionable benefits. We will not apply
                the sanctions to benefits that are specifically for children
                (child benefit and guardian’s allowance) or to those which
                meet the extra costs of disability (disability living allowance
                and attendance allowance). Nor will we sanction retirement
                pension, as research has shown this benefit to be virtually free
                of fraud.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The measures are intended to be tough, but,
                as with other sanctions in the social security system, they
                include fallback provisions to protect the most vulnerable —
                those people and their families who rely on income- related
                benefits. People on income-related jobseeker’s allowance will
                be able to apply for help under a hardship scheme. If their
                other circumstances are not such as to protect them from
                hardship, they will be paid at a rate which reduces the offender’s
                personal allowance by 40%, or 20% for cases of particular
                interest: for example, where a member of the household is
                seriously ill. Benefits for the rest of the household will be
                unaffected. For people on income support, access to such a
                scheme would be automatic. Housing benefit would remain in
                payment, as would access to other benefits such as milk tokens
                and free school meals.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The scheme closely mirrors the hardship
                scheme that already operates for labour market sanctions, a
                scheme which has been tried and tested. We believe that this
                scheme is fair in that it strikes the right balance between, on
                the one hand, a punishment which brings home the point that
                fraud will not be tolerated, and on the other, ensuring that
                offenders, and their families in particular, do not suffer
                unduly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I should stress that the main aim of this
                measure is deterrence. We do not want to see it being applied to
                large numbers of people: indeed, quite the reverse. The fewer
                people who are subject to the sanction, the better, because that
                means it is having the intended deterrent effect.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A second key to cracking benefit fraud
                identified by the Grabiner Report is the need for access to
                independent information about a claimant’s financial and other
                circumstances. Fraud is committed by people telling lies or
                concealing the facts about their circumstances. If we are to
                succeed in rooting fraud out of the system, we need to be able
                to check what people tell us with third parties. For example, if
                we suspect that a person is claiming benefit and is concealing
                his earnings from work, cross-checking the information that we
                hold with additional independent sources, for example banks,
                would help to establish the fraud.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill includes measures to allow officers
                authorised by the Department or the Housing Executive to require
                information from specified private- or public-sector
                organisations, including banks, building societies and credit
                reference agencies, where we have reasonable grounds for
                suspicion. I must stress that these powers do not provide carte
                blanche to pry into people’s bank accounts. The Bill is clear
                on that, and it will also be made clear in a publicly available
                code of practice that will set out how the powers will be used.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Mr Speaker in the Chair)</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, it is important to say that what
                constitutes reasonable grounds will vary from case to case, and
                for that reason it is not appropriate to put specific conditions
                into the legislation. There would be reasonable grounds for
                suspicion where there were reasons to believe that a person was
                receiving or claiming benefit fraudulently. Staff authorised to
                use these powers will need to analyse their records and note
                their suspicions. They will always consider whether there could
                be an innocent explanation for any circumstances. Examples of
                what would be taken into account are tip-offs from members of
                the public, suspicious behaviour on the part of a claimant or
                unsatisfactory identity documents.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Objective statistical evidence that a person
                was disproportionately likely to commit fraud would also provide
                reasonable grounds. For example, we know that people who have
                committed benefit fraud before are more likely to do so again. I
                stress that the evidence would need to be objective, and
                obviously these powers would not be used on grounds such as
                community background, race or sex.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill also seeks to tackle the problem of
                housing benefit being paid on empty properties. In some cases,
                that is a calculated fraud, where the address is being used to
                support a claim for income support or jobseeker’s allowance
                under a false identity — known in the trade as a &quot;giro
                drop&quot;. In others, the fraud is committed by the landlord,
                who does not tell the Housing Executive that the tenant has
                moved out. In other instances, the tenant simply abandons the
                property without bothering to tell the landlord or the Housing
                Executive. To help to put a stop to this and other types of
                fraud, the Bill will enable us to obtain information from the
                utility companies about abnormal levels of consumption that may
                indicate benefit fraud.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have already referred to the problem of
                people working and claiming benefit. We have looked beyond the
                problem itself to one of its major facilitators — employers
                who are more than happy to have the state subsidise their wage
                and National Insurance bills by colluding with their employees
                in committing this type of benefit fraud. They are taking
                advantage of their workforce by denying them proper terms of
                employment, and they gain unfair advantage in the market by
                paying low wages. That is unfair competition against honest
                employers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The prosecution of employers who have
                colluded in benefit fraud can be lengthy and costly and may not
                always be the most effective way of tackling this problem.
                Obviously, we will continue to prosecute the most serious cases.
                For the less serious cases, the Bill allows the application of a
                swift civil penalty that will bring home the message that
                operating in the informal economy carries a high price and will
                not be tolerated. That will strengthen the ability of the
                Department and the Housing Executive to bring to book employers
                who collude with their employees in social security fraud. The
                measures provide for an administrative penalty of between
                £1,000 and £5,000 to be paid by a colluding employer as an
                alternative to prosecution. The penalty would be subject to the
                same safeguards that apply to administrative penalties for
                claimants — the employer will have the option of having the
                court decide the case. If an employer accepts the penalty as an
                alternative to going to court, he has up to 28 days to change
                his mind.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is estimated that up to 70% of fraud
                occurs not at the start of a claim, but during its currency,
                when changes of circumstances which affect benefit entitlement
                go unreported.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Current legislation fails to impose a
                watertight duty on claimants to report changes and is therefore
                inadequate for cases where payment is made directly to a bank
                account and where no signed declaration of unchanged
                circumstances is available. We are reforming those powers to
                ensure that they are effective and to give a clear message that
                such sins of omission are crimes nonetheless and will be
                punished.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, the Bill contains tidying-up
                measures that will clarify the legislation that enables
                prosecution when claimants deliberately fail to report changes
                of circumstances. It will allow the Department and the Housing
                Executive to act together to offer administrative penalties in
                place of prosecution in cases involving housing benefit as well
                as Department for Social Development administered benefits. It
                will strengthen arrangements for the supply of information by
                the Housing Executive to the Department, or to the Secretary of
                State for Social Security, by specifying in directions rather
                than regulations what information is required.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The provisions of the Bill are a measured
                response to the problem. Considerable care has been taken to
                ensure that the Great Britain and Northern Ireland Bills are
                compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In conclusion, the Bill contains important
                measures that will significantly reduce fraud in the benefit
                system and thereby restore the public’s confidence in it. I
                commend the Bill to the Assembly.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Paisley Jnr:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today’s debate need not have taken place.
                It is only taking place because accelerated passage was denied
                to the Bill a few weeks ago. We are here to commence a gestated
                period of debate because of that denial. I had hoped that
                accelerated passage would have been given to the Bill, because
                it is important that the Assembly offer an immediate response to
                an immediate and ongoing problem.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Millions of pounds are lost to the Social
                Security Agency every year because people defraud it. Of course,
                there are people who do not claim their benefit, but the fear of
                fraud and the concerns about it are a problem that must be dealt
                with. It is very disappointing that this Bill cannot go through
                the House quickly, so that we send out all the right messages to
                those who are trying to steal money from other people’s
                pockets.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is unfortunate that a certain party
                decided to oppose accelerated passage. However, given that the
                Assembly has chosen the normal course for passage of this Bill,
                I am amazed that that party is not even here today. They are not
                even here to give us their view. People will watch the gestated
                period of Committee proceedings and further readings carefully
                to see whether that party is interested in making a major
                contribution to change this Bill. The party’s denial of
                accelerated passage was more to do with political opposition to
                the Minister and political opposition to catching the fraudster
                than a constructive approach to the Bill.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important that the Assembly send out
                all the right messages when tackling fraud — and that it sends
                out a clear signal on this matter. Some people may be reluctant,
                but it is absolutely necessary that we do that. The Minister
                said that the Bill is about protecting the vulnerable. That is a
                key issue. It is about protecting those who are having their
                rights taken from them. It is crucial that everything is done to
                ensure the delivery of benefit payments to the right people at
                the right time, all the time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Social Security Fraud Bill is one way to
                protect the vulnerable from losing their rights. I understand
                that £73 million has been lost because of social security fraud
                in Northern Ireland.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is an amazing amount of money, and it
                could have been used for a far greater good than going to false
                claimants. It is unfair to honest claimants and to the public in
                general that a small minority of claimants can cheat the system
                and make big money.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly is aware of the problem of
                fraud; Mr Billy Bell highlighted some of those problems in a
                previous report. I am all the more amazed, therefore, that the
                Assembly should try to slow the passage of the Bill, after his
                investigation into fraud in the social security system. Just
                today, Members received a press release on the Northern Ireland
                Audit Office’s report on the agency’s management of social
                security debt collection and fraud. It highlights the need for
                active encouragement for work to tackle fraud in Northern
                Ireland. Unfortunately, any delay in the tackling of fraud will
                cost Northern Ireland hundreds of thousands of pounds every
                month.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the Minister said, parity is a two-edged
                sword. It is correct that we should enjoy the same rights and
                benefits as people in Great Britain, and it is equally right
                that we play our part in tackling benefit fraud. With the right
                to benefit comes the responsibility to tackle those who defraud
                the benefits system. I agree wholeheartedly with the Minister
                about that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also agree with the Minister that the Bill
                is not draconian, nor is it a great axe that he looks forward to
                wielding. It is a deterrent. It is important that people keep
                things in perspective. The Bill will help the Department to
                prosecute the more serious cases, and it will deter those who
                see other people cheating the system from thinking that they can
                get away with it too. The Minister made it clear that the
                Department hopes that the deterrent value will be such that it
                will not have to use those powers repeatedly. The ability to
                check information will itself be a significant deterrent to
                would-be fraudsters. The Bill allows for the checking of the
                information that a claimant must give; it does not ask for
                anything special.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to refer to clauses 1 and 2.
                Fraud takes place when people knowingly lie about their
                circumstances in order to obtain benefit. They have not made a
                mistake; they deliberately try to mislead the Department. By
                definition, a person who engages in fraud will not volunteer the
                truth. People lie about whether they have a job. There should be
                a deterrent to stop people lying about that.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order. The Member may be under some
                misunderstanding about the passage of the Bill. He said earlier
                that, with accelerated passage, this debate need not have taken
                place. That is not correct. With accelerated passage, there
                would still be a Second Stage; it is only the Committee Stage
                that would not take place. The purpose of this Stage is for
                discussion of the general principles of the Bill, but the Member
                is now moving into a discussion of each clause. That is properly
                the function of the Committee Stage, which will now take place,
                according to procedure. This is a debate about the broad
                principles of the Bill.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Paisley Jnr:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Speaker for that direction. I
                will stick to the broad principles contained in clauses 1, 2 and
                15.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order. The debate is about the broad
                principles of the Bill, not the broad principles of clauses 1
                and 2.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Paisley Jnr:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Bill is an attempt to clamp down on
                people who lie about whether they have a job, whether they have
                savings, whether their partner works and about who they are and
                where they live. It is essential that the Department have the
                strength to investigate those matters to find out whether the
                information is correct and to ensure that the right money goes
                to the right people at the right time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also look forward to seeing the code of
                practice and the safeguards contained in it. It is essential
                that the Department attempt to ensure that social security money
                goes to the right people, not to those who try by mischief to
                defraud the Department.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the powers to obtain information are not
                introduced in Northern Ireland at the same time and date as in
                the rest of the United Kingdom, Northern Ireland will lose a
                vast amount of money. I have read that that loss could be as
                much as £400,000 a month. It will be interesting to find out
                whether that loss is incurred if we do not put this instrument
                in place at the same time as in the rest of the United Kingdom.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other important clauses in the Bill would
                make it an offence to fail to notify a change in circumstances.
                Will the Minister tell the House how many cases last year could
                have been affected by the absence of the Social Security Fraud
                Bill, particularly in regard to those matters outlined in clause
                15?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will finish with an apocryphal story — or
                perhaps it is not an apocryphal one. Some time ago, a certain
                politician, it is believed, used a car under the motability
                scheme when that person ought not to have done so. After a
                television documentary, it appeared that some people’s
                concerns about motability fraud still had not changed. However,
                the prospect of a mayoral car was seen as a measure to prevent
                further motability fraud. That did not seem to do the trick,
                because yet another political party did not believe that that
                was the right strategy to tackle motability fraud.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today, the House should send out a clear
                &quot;No&quot; to fraud and give the Department every
                encouragement and strength to tackle any attempt to prevent the
                right money going to the right people at the right time. Even
                though the legislation must go through a Committee Stage, I hope
                that the Minister can take encouragement that there are parties
                in the Assembly that are willing to back him in his fight to
                tackle fraud as it raises its head in the social security
                system.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Morrow:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome Mr Paisley Jnr’s comments. He has
                spoken in support of what the Department for Social Development
                is trying to achieve. I will not go through a long winding-up
                speech. Mr Paisley Jnr asked how many cases could have been
                affected by the absence of a provision similar to clause 15. He
                is entitled to the most accurate answer that I can give him.
                Last year, there were 228 fraud cases involving payment by
                automated credit transfer, with the potential — and I
                emphasise &quot;potential&quot; — to be prosecuted. However,
                the absence of the provision contained in clause 15 precluded
                such action in those cases. Therefore the Department for Social
                Development will be better armed and better equipped to deal
                directly in cases of fraud when the Social Security Fraud Bill
                becomes law.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The code of practice is now available and
                will be in the public domain shortly. When I went before the
                Committee for Social Development to explain the different parts
                of the Bill, Members expressed their concern about the
                availability of the code of practice.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am happy to confirm that the code of
                practice is in place and will be made available. I welcome the
                comments made by Mr Paisley Jnr and his wholehearted support for
                what we are trying to achieve.</p>

                have been widely welcomed by Members and users of trust law. The
                Bill will undoubtedly facilitate better administration of
                charitable and private trusts. It will help trustees and
                beneficiaries alike. In some respects, the changes are overdue

                to access. They are wholly dependent on adults to raise and deal
                with their concerns.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are almost 500,000 children in Northern
                Ireland, and they represent 30% of the population. Although the
                vast majority of our children have a healthy, happy and secure
                childhood, we are all too familiar with the horror stories of
                neglect, abuse or exploitation of our children and young people.
                All too often, we read in the press about the tragic
                consequences of failures by systems to protect children. In many
                cases, the failure is as a result of a lack of co-operation and
                co-ordination between organisations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Just a couple of weeks ago, the local
                newspapers screamed headlines of &quot;Agencies Blasted Over Boy’s
                Death&quot;; and &quot;Tragic Teenager Failed By Systems&quot;.
                These headlines reported the tragic death of a 14-year-old
                Belfast boy who should have been in secure care accommodation.
                The magistrate in the case is quoted as having said:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;This court and the general public will
                want to know why Government agencies failed to protect this
                vulnerable young man and many other boys and girls&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The announcement in the House on 29 January
                by the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister of their
                intention to appoint a children’s commissioner for Northern
                Ireland was given a widespread welcome. It was welcomed as a
                step towards ensuring that our children can grow up in a
                society, safe from exploitation and abuse, where their rights
                are protected and where their needs are met.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After that announcement, the Committee of the
                Centre embarked on an inquiry to examine the proposal and
                consider the role and remit of a children’s commissioner. Over
                a six-week period the Committee listened to more than 13 hours
                of oral evidence and questioned 51 individuals from 27
                organisations, including statutory and voluntary bodies. We also
                listened to the views of a group of 11 young people and what
                they thought of the proposal. We invited representatives from
                Wales and Norway to hear at first hand about their experience of
                a children’s commissioner. There were many diverse interests
                among those organisations, but they all had one thing in common
                — they all argued passionately in favour of having a children’s
                commissioner.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the evidence sessions the Committee
                heard shocking and dramatic statistics about some of the most
                vulnerable groups of children in our society. These included
                children born in Northern Ireland who were described as being
                &quot;destined to fail&quot; and who needed support right from
                birth to help them to break that cycle.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We heard about the intolerable levels of
                physical and sexual abuse in our society, and we heard that in
                Northern Ireland three children are raped every week, and
                another 12 are indecently assaulted. The Committee heard about
                the number of children in the juvenile justice system. Last
                year, over 340 children between the ages of 10 and 17 were
                locked up in Northern Ireland. We heard that at any given time
                about 30 children are locked up in our two juvenile justice
                centres, and over 600 are subject to statutory supervision
                orders in the community. Why is that happening? Can we not do
                better?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In 1999, there were 2,324 children in public
                care in Northern Ireland. Sixty-five per cent of them are in
                foster care in people’s homes throughout Northern Ireland. I
                hold in highest regard those people who open their homes to
                children who have not had a good start in life to try to give
                them a chance. Many of the children will have experienced
                difficulties in their lives. They have the right to feel safe
                and protected from abuse and neglect.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We learned that approximately 11% of children
                in public care are in residential care. We also heard a very
                alarming statistic: one in five girls aged 16 to 18 will become
                pregnant within six months of leaving care.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We heard about children whose lives are
                affected by the criminal justice system because they or their
                parents have been involved in court proceedings. The children of
                prisoners seem to have received little attention in the past.
                Recent research in England and Wales shows that 63% of boys
                whose fathers have a criminal conviction will be involved in
                court proceedings by the age of 15. The figure rises to a
                dramatic 93% in cases where both parents have had criminal
                convictions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We learned that 71% of young offenders and
                young men under the age of 21 given community sentences will
                have fathered one child. Forty-two per cent of them will have
                fathered two or more children. This is further compounded by the
                fact that 62% of those young men, by the age of 23, will have no
                further contact with their children.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee heard about the problems faced
                by children in ethnic minority groups. This is particularly
                evident in the travelling community. For example, 18% of
                travellers are under five years of age, compared with 8% in the
                settled community. Fifty-three per cent of travellers are under
                17 years of age. Infant mortality and physical disability rates
                are three times higher among travellers than among the settled
                community. They also suffer from higher levels of chronic
                illness.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is estimated that there are 14,000
                children with a disability in Northern Ireland. The term
                &quot;children with a disability&quot; refers to a large and
                varied group, often with different and complex needs. It was
                pointed out to the Committee that regardless of this statistic,
                the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 does not apply to
                children under 16 years of age. The Disability Discrimination
                Act is being reviewed, and this group was cited as an example of
                where a children’s commissioner could make a difference. The
                commissioner could ensure that the needs of children with
                disabilities are taken into account.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are 76,000 one-parent families in
                Northern Ireland, with approximately 145,000 children — almost
                one third of the children in our Province live in one-parent
                families. In 7% of those families the parent is under 20 years
                of age; they are little more than children themselves.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Human Rights Commission argued for a
                commissioner to act as a watchdog for the rights of children.
                The Commission called for someone with status and respect to
                monitor the implementation of the United Nations Convention on
                the Rights of the Child and to cover every aspect of children’s
                lives. The Commission called for the children’s commissioner
                to have strong investigative powers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Equality Commission reminded us that
                children are not a homogenous group; there is a vast array of
                children, and they have multiple identities. As part of its
                approval of equality schemes, the Equality Commission identified
                a gap in the carrying out of direct consultation with children
                and young people. This was particularly evident for young people
                with learning disabilities. The Equality Commission argued
                strongly that there was no substitute for children being their
                own advocates as part of a direct consultation process.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many organisations in the voluntary care
                sector came together under the banner of Putting Children First.
                This was co-ordinated by Child Care NI. This group has been
                campaigning for some time for a children’s commissioner in
                Northern Ireland and put a strong and convincing case to the
                Committee. Thanks to the co-ordination of Child Care NI, and Mrs
                Mary Cunningham in particular, the Committee was able to hear
                the views of 15 organisations during two days of evidence. They
                argued that children are our most valuable and, sometimes, our
                most vulnerable citizens.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They called for a children’s commissioner
                who would work not only with those in difficulties, such as
                those living in poverty, those who are abused, those who are in
                the care system or those in the juvenile justice system, but who
                would work with and for all children.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The organisations called for the commissioner
                to have strong powers to investigate all forms of abuse and gave
                examples of how he could take action on sexual abuse in children’s
                homes, bullying in schools or on behalf of children detained
                under mental health legislation. They highlighted the need for a
                holistic approach to strike a balance between parents’ rights
                and children’s rights and argued that he would need to consult
                parents and guardians on promoting children’s rights.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several groups that work directly with
                children in care or in the juvenile justice system reported
                young people’s views on a children’s commissioner. They
                clearly want someone who will listen to what they say and do
                something about it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee met a group of young people,
                mainly in the 14 to 17 age range, at Magee College in
                Londonderry. The group from the north-west was brought together
                by the Western Young People’s Steering Committee, which is
                organised by the Western Health and Social Services Board. The
                young people were very forthright and wanted assurance that a
                commissioner would be someone with whom they could identify and
                communicate. Although the number of young people who gave direct
                evidence to the inquiry was limited, it highlighted to the
                Committee the absolute need, if there was ever any doubt, to
                involve young people in drawing up the proposals for a children’s
                commissioner.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While at Magee College the Committee also
                heard from the Derry Children’s Commission, an organisation
                made up of statutory organisations, including the council and
                health services board and voluntary and community groups that
                are working for children’s rights in the area. The group had
                very strong views on the role of a children’s commissioner.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Northern Ireland branch of the British
                Association of Social Workers argued strongly for a children’s
                strategy here and for the children’s commissioner to be
                responsible for its implementation. The association saw the
                primary value of a commissioner as someone who could see the big
                picture and draw attention to the positive and negative aspects
                of practice.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Guardian Ad Litem Agency and the Law
                Society of Northern Ireland joined forces to give evidence. They
                strongly welcomed the proposals for a children’s commissioner
                and highlighted some issues in their field that might be
                addressed by him.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One example related to article 12 of the
                United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. Under that
                article, children capable of forming views have a right to be
                heard in any judicial or administrative proceedings affecting
                them, and although that obligation is fully met in public law
                proceedings, it is not met in private law cases, such as
                contested custody hearings. They argued that a children’s
                commissioner could ensure that such areas were addressed and
                resolved.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly Ombudsman gave evidence to the
                Committee about the potential overlap between his office and
                that of the proposed children’s commissioner. He argued that
                acting as a champion for children should be the core role of a
                children’s commissioner, as it encompasses advocacy, research,
                monitoring and assistance with enforcement.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Health and Social
                Services Committee of the National Assembly for Wales told us of
                her experience. The Commissioner for Children in Wales has only
                recently been appointed, and it is too early to see results.
                However, there are valuable lessons for the Committee in how the
                consultation and appointment were carried out.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The innovative way in which young people in
                Wales were involved in the appointment of the Commissioner for
                Children particularly impressed the Committee. A group of 15
                young people were directly involved in agreeing the assessment
                process and took part in the selection of candidates. After
                comprehensive training and guidance, those young people were
                invited to meet and interview all the shortlisted candidates.
                Two were then delegated to sit in on the formal selection panel.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was most appropriate that the final
                evidence session was from the Ombudsman for Children in Norway,
                the first country to make such an appointment. Up to then, the
                Committee had listened to well-reasoned arguments and people’s
                hopes and aspirations for a children’s commissioner here. For
                the first time we were given an insight into how it worked in
                practice.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee heard at first hand from
                someone who is tackling the problems that had been highlighted
                by others. One of the most interesting things about the session
                was that before it arguments had concentrated on the need to
                co-ordinate, monitor and enforce statutory services for
                children. In Norway, the Ombudsman also deals with those issues,
                but children set his agenda to a large extent. Many of the
                issues are more general cases of principle.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.45 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He highlighted recent concerns there about
                infections resulting from body-piercing, which is not regulated
                in Norway. Another example was the campaign to ban cosmetic
                surgery for 16- to 18-year-olds. The Ombudsman illustrated the
                type of issues he tackles with private companies:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;In Norway we do not have school
                uniforms as you have here. This means that we have one of the
                most expensive school uniforms in the world. You have to wear
                the right jacket, have the Nokia 3310, and wear the right shoes.
                Companies identify the most popular children in the school yard,
                who then receive free clothes for a few months. Advertising is
                not allowed in schools, but the children are used as indirect
                commercials.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a result of that investigation the
                Ombudsman is about to publish a report on the commercial
                pressure on children. Censure by the Ombudsman is taken very
                seriously in Norway and can achieve very positive results.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Ombudsman also examined the age of
                consent. Adults in Norway had been considering lowering it, but
                young people did not want that, and the Ombudsman drove forward
                their point of view.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Having listened to all the detailed
                arguments, the Committee strongly and unanimously supports the
                proposals for a children’s commissioner for Northern Ireland.
                It also supports the development of a comprehensive strategy for
                Northern Ireland and sees the appointment of a children’s
                commissioner as a core element of that. The Committee considered
                the role of the children’s commissioner in significant detail
                and made 35 recommendations in its inquiry report. I do not
                intend to go into those in detail, but a few of them are central
                to the appointment of the children’s commissioner.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee heard many calls for the
                children’s commissioner to be independent, and the possibility
                of the post’s being part of an existing organisation was
                explored. We concluded, however, that the commissioner must be
                totally separate from all Government, departmental and public
                bodies. That would ensure a distinct identity and that any
                challenge or oversight function could be carried out
                independently of such bodies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee also concluded that the
                commissioner must have a broad remit for all children so that he
                can study all aspects of children’s lives and be a champion
                for them. That was described as &quot;having a helicopter
                view&quot; and &quot;being able to see the big picture&quot;. By
                having that overview, the commissioner could draw attention to
                areas where there are gaps or a lack of proper co-ordination.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That role, however, must not extend to
                include interference in family life. The primary responsibility
                for children must remain with the parents. Government agencies
                or the commissioner should step in only when the well-being of
                children is threatened by the failure of parents to meet their
                responsibilities.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There was unanimous agreement among witnesses
                and Committee members that the commissioner’s role must
                include reserved matters. The commissioner must be able to
                ensure that children in the juvenile justice system receive
                their full rights. Some of the statistics mentioned earlier
                highlight the difficulties faced by children in this area and
                the enormity of the task to be tackled by the children’s
                commissioner.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee also decided that the
                commissioner must have full powers of investigation, including
                the power to investigate complaints and initiate enquiries. As
                part of that, the commissioner should be able to compel the
                production of evidence, including the disclosure of documents,
                the power to enter premises and to subpoena witnesses.
                Similarly, the commissioner must be able to support children in
                court cases or to initiate cases on their behalf. However, the
                Committee was equally clear that those powers should be used
                strategically, only when all other avenues had been exhausted.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The most important people in the debate are
                children and young people. We must never lose sight of the fact
                that they are the reason for appointing a children’s
                commissioner. I have already mentioned the need for meaningful
                consultation with young people in drawing up the commissioner’s
                remit. When it comes to the appointment process, children and
                young people must be at the forefront of everyone’s mind. They
                must remain our primary focus. The primary criterion for the
                post of commissioner must be the ability to relate directly to
                children. That is more important than a qualification in law or
                social work.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Norway, the first ombudsman was a
                psychologist, and the next was a children’s television
                personality — an entertainer. Several times in the evidence
                sessions we heard calls for the commissioner to be someone who
                is as much at ease when talking to nursery-school children as
                when addressing politicians.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How can we ensure that someone with that
                special quality is appointed? The Committee believes that the
                best way to do that is to have young people directly involved in
                the appointment process. When appointed, the commissioner must
                identify with children and listen to the issues that concern
                them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We heard much during the evidence sessions
                about children’s rights. I am sure that most children do not
                understand a great deal about the UN Convention on the Rights of
                the Child. However, as someone said during the inquiry, children
                have a keen sense of what is fair and unfair. That is the
                language of rights that they understand; it is important to them
                that things are fair. Therefore when the commissioner is
                appointed, children must be able to feel that they know and can
                trust that person. They must feel that the commissioner is on
                their side and is someone who will ensure that they get a fair
                deal.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although the commissioner must have teeth to
                act when necessary, he or she must also be able to promote the
                positive achievements and vision of children. As the Norwegian
                Ombudsman put it:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;People grow tired of you if you act as
                a watchdog that bites every day. If you are going to be a
                spokesperson for children, you must also represent the vision of
                children for the future&quot;.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I submit the report to the Assembly and
                invite Members to give it their full endorsement.</p>
                <b>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Given that this is a time-limited debate —
                with a limit of two hours — and that we must leave the usual
                amount of time for the Minister to respond, I am forced to ask
                Members to restrict their comments to not more than seven
                minutes. Even with that we may not get through all the Members
                who wish to speak. Therefore I appeal to those who can be more
                concise than seven minutes to oblige the House by doing so. I
                ask all Members who are speaking, including the Chairperson in
                his winding-up speech, to keep it to not more than seven
                minutes.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy Chairperson of the Committee of
                the Centre (Mr Gibson):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All Committee members were struck by the
                enthusiasm, genuineness and sincerity of the presentations.
                Without doubt, they proved the need for a commissioner for
                children and demonstrated that there is a failing in the present
                system. There is no means of dovetailing and co-ordinating the
                work of the various statutory and other agencies that try as
                best they can to deal with the small percentage of people whom
                one person described as being &quot;destined to fail&quot;. The
                appointment of a children’s commissioner is seen as a means of
                breaking that cycle.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Not only was the case proven, but it was also
                made clear that the scope of a commissioner’s role should
                cover every child from day one to age 18. In cases where the
                person may have been in care or need additional help, the
                commissioner’s involvement should be extended for at least
                five years after that person becomes 18.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It was interesting to hear the different
                views. The present Ombudsman made the point that there should
                perhaps be a sharper focus on the role of a commissioner.
                However, the majority and strength of the evidence showed that
                the commissioner’s remit should be broadband and cover all
                aspects of children’s lives. Those recommendations are
                embodied in the report.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Childproofing legislation was also looked at,
                and the Committee made eight recommendations on the children’s
                commissioner’s remit for that area. The Committee debated
                whether that remit should extend to reserved matters. It
                recommends that the commissioner for children should have the
                ability to intervene in the juvenile court system and be able to
                advocate and raise areas of concern.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There was much discussion about how young
                people could be given a voice. It is generally felt that we all
                sometimes take the view that adults know best. However, the view
                that we should give children a voice came across very forcibly.
                Therefore we made a further eight recommendations on how a
                commissioner should develop a role for children.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We discussed how far a commissioner should be
                able to intervene in the legal system. We recommended that a
                children’s commissioner should have the power to intervene in
                legal cases so that the rights of the child could be fully
                considered. We also considered to whom the commissioner should
                be accountable. We felt very strongly that the commissioner
                should be independent. However, in a democracy we must decide
                where the commissioner should report. We decided that the
                commissioner should submit an annual report to the Office of the
                First Minister and the Deputy First Minister and report to the
                appropriate Assembly Committee. That seemed to be the only
                secure way to address the issue. We studied the independence of
                all bodies and organisations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We also studied the criteria for making the
                appointment, and we made suggestions on that matter. If a
                children’s commissioner is appointed, the Assembly and the
                Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister
                should turn their attention to the final important
                recommendation in paragraph 4.7.11.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;the commissioner for children should be
                given adequate resources to carry out the full remit. In setting
                the initial budget for the commissioner the First Minister and
                the Deputy First Minister should take account of funding for
                Commissioners in other European countries bearing in mind any
                differences in size or population.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The amount of funding certainly varied from
                one country to the next, but there were suggestive indications
                in the evidence.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The appointment of a children’s
                commissioner is seen as a core element of a wider strategy that
                sets out a vision for the future of the children of Northern
                Ireland. I commend our report to the Assembly. I thank those who
                gave evidence, and our staff, who were very supportive and
                courteous. The report is worth sincere consideration by the
                Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson of the Committee for Health,
                Social Services and Public Safety (Dr Hendron):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I congratulate Mr Poots and his Committee on
                this excellent report. Last December, in its report to the
                Assembly on residential and secure accommodation for children in
                Northern Ireland, the Health, Social Services and Public Safety
                Committee called for the appointment of a commissioner for
                children. Therefore the Committee welcomes the report from the
                Committee of the Centre. We now need to move speedily to
                introduce the necessary legislation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the roles recommended for the
                commissioner in the report involves assessing legislation and
                submitting proposals and recommendations for change. That is
                laudable, but I would like the commissioner to have the power to
                ensure that the present legislation is fully implemented.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.00 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the commissioner ensures that the Children
                (Northern Ireland) Order 1995 is fully implemented, we will be
                going a long way towards resolving many problems facing the most
                underprivileged children in Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with most of the report. However, I
                would like to have some idea of the cost of implementing the 35
                recommendations. In recommendation 19 the Committee suggests
                that the commissioner should have power to intervene in legal
                cases. As soon as I hear the word &quot;legal&quot; I get very
                nervous about costs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There have been arguments for a minister for
                children. However, as has already been mentioned, such a person
                would be an integral part of Government, whereas an independent
                commissioner could provide children’s causes with much needed
                profile, as well as advise the Executive of their
                responsibilities under the United Nations Convention on the
                Rights of the Child.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Committee strongly believes that the
                treatment of children and young people in adult psychiatric
                wards should cease. I wonder what mental health services are to
                be developed for 16- to 18-year-olds. Mr Poots raised that issue
                also. The rights of the child are paramount, especially those of
                the most vulnerable children, such as those going into care,
                those already in care or those coming out of care. It is wrong
                that trusts can place children in homes already operating at
                full capacity and where there is a shortage of appropriately
                trained staff.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Before planned admission, the relevant agency
                should complete a placement and risk analysis. A care plan for
                each child should include a protective strategy, approved by the
                registration and inspection unit, setting out action to reduce
                risk and taking into account the needs of the child. All of this
                activity would be under the commissioner’s remit.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree with the Committee’s findings that
                the role of the commissioner for children should extend to
                reserved matters, including the juvenile justice system. Mr
                Poots mentioned the little boy who lost his life recently. I
                recall that little boy and the magistrate’s comments. I pay
                tribute to resident magistrate, Mr Desmond Perry, who, with his
                colleagues, continually emphasises the need for collective
                responsibility for young people before the courts.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report emphasises the need for
                communication with children in language that they understand,
                and we support that. The Chairperson of the Health and Social
                Services Committee of the National Assembly for Wales made the
                important point that the commissioner should have the
                opportunity to scrutinise how the police treat children and the
                policies that they employ towards children. Regardless of
                whether it is on the Falls Road or the Shankill Road, in
                Northern Ireland, England, Ireland or elsewhere, people who are
                in an unhappy environment — particularly vulnerable
                adolescents — have a habit of getting into trouble with the
                law. Therefore it is very important that a commissioner for
                children look into those matters. It is important also that a
                children’s commissioner should have powers of investigation,
                discovery and subpoena.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, we are aware of the number of
                suicides in Northern Ireland. That can be only the tip of the
                iceberg. There are hundreds of young people in Northern Ireland
                who are unhappy and suffer from low self-esteem and depression
                and who are therefore very vulnerable. We look forward to the
                appointment of a children’s commissioner as soon as possible.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr C Murphy:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I
                welcome the report; it is a very good report. It was largely
                compiled, agreed, drafted and redrafted in the middle of an
                election campaign, and that was no mean feat for the Committee
                of the Centre. I commend the staff who helped us. I would also
                like to place on record my appreciation of the many groups who
                gave evidence to us. By and large, they were very professional
                in their presentations and well informed on the issues.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The process of taking evidence and exchanging
                views with those organisations has given the Committee knowledge
                of the issue that will stand it in good stead when examining the
                legislative proposals when they come from the Office of the
                First Minister and the Deputy First Minister.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some of the key recommendations or
                requirements for an effective children’s commissioner kept
                jumping out at us from the evidence that was given. Most of them
                are reflected in the report, and I will list what I regard to be
                some of the most important. The children’s commissioner should
                act as an independent watchdog for the rights of children. The
                commissioner should childproof existing and new legislation and
                policy for compliance with domestic and international human
                rights standards. The commissioner should be able to take cases
                in his or her own name or fund children to take cases where
                there has been a denial of children’s rights. The commissioner
                should be empowered to enter and seize any documents, and he or
                she should receive adequate resources to fulfil those functions.
                The commissioner should be able to intervene, where appropriate,
                in legal proceedings that may have implications for children’s
                rights. In response to Dr Hendron, costs should not be a factor
                here, as the protection of children’s rights supersedes any
                cost issues that might arise.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The commissioner should actively engage, and
                consult directly with, children and young people, and have all
                the necessary powers to undertake effective investigations into
                any aspect of children’s rights. He or she should encourage,
                resource and conduct research into children’s rights and
                should consult regularly with children’s rights organisations
                and monitor the delivery or denial of children’s rights for
                compliance with domestic and international human rights
                standards. The commissioner should also have the remit for all
                matters pertaining to children, including those matters at
                present reserved. He or she should be able to act as an advocate
                for children’s rights and a channel for children’s voices.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The commissioner should promote understanding
                and education of children’s rights. He or she should also have
                the necessary powers to compile information and statistics on
                children and produce an annual report on the state of children.
                The commissioner should promote a culture of children’s
                rights. The key themes emerging from all the evidence that we
                heard are that the office or post of children’s commissioner
                should have adequate powers and resources, and it should be
                totally independent, although accountable to the Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I commend this report to the Assembly. Most
                of the recommendations from the various groups are contained in
                the report. I have no doubt that the record of today’s debate
                will be studied by the Office of the First Minister and the
                Deputy First Minister. That Office now has an opportunity to set
                a standard for others in the remit, powers and resources that it
                will propose to give to the children’s commissioner. I hope
                that it will make use of this report and that it will build upon
                it to ensure the creation of a children’s commissioner’s
                post that will effectively promote, protect and serve the
                interests of all our children. I recommend this report to the
                Assembly. Go raibh maith agat.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs E Bell:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion. The Chairman of the
                Committee of the Centre must be congratulated for his
                comprehensive address. I will keep my remarks general.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today is another important stepping stone on
                the path to the appointment of a children’s commissioner for
                Northern Ireland. It is also significant because of the
                consensus across the parties that was evident as we worked at
                the report on this necessary appointment. There may be
                differences regarding the role, responsibilities, duties and
                powers to be given, but there is general agreement that in the
                current climate it is important to appoint a designated
                commissioner or even a minister for children. That will ensure
                that the concerns, needs and opinions of children and young
                people affect the policies of all Departments, thereby improving
                their situation in a more meaningful and practical way.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The statistics read out by the Chairman of
                the Committee of the Centre leave one in no doubt that children
                are disadvantaged, abused and hurt in different ways, almost
                every day. This appointment is, therefore, long overdue. All the
                evidence and submissions that came to the Committee pointed out
                that this appointment should be open and transparent. They made
                it clear that the office should be independent, accessible and
                given adequate resources — financial and staffing — to carry
                out its duties without fear or favour.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is also vital that children and young
                people from all backgrounds and situations are involved —
                although not necessarily in the actual appointment — in
                working with the commissioner in the implementation of the full
                range of duties and the development of the policies. That will
                ensure that childproofing takes place from the very beginning of
                a policy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I refer to the recommendations on the roles
                and responsibilities — recommendations 9 and 14 — which
                Members can read for themselves. These outline the Committee’s
                wish that the commissioner should work to improve the means of
                communication with children and young people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The postholder must be accessible to all
                children, not just those with major problems, so that there is a
                vehicle of advice and support for every child. Organisations
                such as Childline, NSPCC and Barnardos will confirm that
                children, like adults, can benefit from having a contact who
                takes time to listen to their problems. Most children
                approaching the commissioner will probably do so through the
                courts — as a result of juvenile justice cases, social
                services referrals or divorce and custody cases — but the
                commissioner should be open to everyone who needs independent,
                objective advice and information.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The powers and duties laid out in the
                recommendations focus on children’s rights, and they should
                prove to be a major step forward for children who find
                themselves, through no fault of their own, in care, detention,
                or suffering from mental trauma or illness caused by tragedy.
                Children do not recognise the difference between reserved and
                transferred matters, but that must not be allowed to affect
                their rights or prevent improvements to their situation. It is
                essential that we offer effective and efficient support in all
                situations. We must always remember that children are, first and
                foremost, children, and the fact that they are young offenders
                or victims of abuse or violence is secondary.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The recommendations also highlight the need
                for competent interaction between all relevant agencies. The
                commissioner could act as a co-ordinator so that children’s
                rights are paramount. For that reason, the commissioner for
                children should also be directly accountable to the Assembly,
                through the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First
                Minister, in order to ensure that all cases receive the utmost
                propriety. Good work with children augurs well for everybody’s
                future. The section on the appointment of the commissioner for
                children was considered carefully, in the light of all the
                concerns that were expressed. We hope that those concerns will
                be addressed. The Budget requirements of such an important post,
                with such a wide remit, must also be taken into account.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank my Colleagues on the Committee of the
                Centre and the Committee Clerks, who prepared the report, for
                all their hard work. I also wish to thank all the deputations
                who came to see us. They were most efficient and gave us much
                food for thought. It was a pleasure to work together on such an
                issue. I hope that the recommendations of the report will be
                considered and implemented.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Morrice:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We welcome the publication of the report. It
                was a pleasure to see Committee members working together so
                constructively, and we congratulate the Committee on a valuable
                and timely document. We also applaud the Committee for taking
                evidence from key organisations, moving around the country and
                involving young people. That was a valuable process, and we hope
                that it will continue; it demonstrates what Members can do when
                they work together.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We agree that the Office of the First
                Minister and the Deputy First Minister should take account of
                the recommendations. The Women’s Coalition put forward its own
                private Member’s Bill on the issue. Many of the principles of
                our Bill are included in the report, so there is similar
                thinking. I look forward to the full implementation of the
                report’s recommendations by the Office of the First Minister
                and the Deputy First Minister.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The role of the commissioner should be
                extended to cover children who are in receipt of post-care
                services, even if they are over 18. The commissioner should also
                be involved in the childproofing of legislation.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This role is particularly important. The
                Executive should be required to have all Bills that are likely
                to be relevant to children passed as of right to the
                commissioner. The commissioner should also have the right to ask
                for legislation that has not been automatically passed to him or
                her.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee report also provides for the
                commissioner to make an annual report. We support this; we also
                suggest that the commissioner should have the power to make
                other reports as he or she sees fit. Such reports may contain
                recommendations for action by others. In particular, the
                commissioner should be able to report recommendations for
                compliance with the provision of the UN Convention on the Rights
                of the Child, as ratified by the Government.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It would be useful if the Executive were to
                produce a code that sets out how the commissioner will be
                consulted. We strongly support the recommendation that the
                commissioner should also deal with reserved matters of juvenile
                justice. We are pleased that the Committee envisages a
                commissioner with adequate powers to investigate complaints,
                including the power to require disclosure of documents. This is
                a valuable recommendation; in fact, it should be the minimum
                standard for such offices. We lobbied for this standard when the
                Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission was being set up.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Similarly, the proposal to enable the
                commissioner to make strategic interventions in legal
                proceedings is very wise. I must commend the statistics that the
                Chairperson gave this afternoon — they were horrifying and
                disturbing, but they represent a valuable resource for
                policy-making. The fact that the children’s commissioner will
                be able to commission research on issues of concern, such as the
                number of children living below the poverty line, is very
                welcome. However, we should be careful that the children’s
                commissioner does not spend the money that the Executive should
                be spending on research. There is no doubt that valuable
                statistics are essential to a good policy on children.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee of the Centre envisages an
                ambitious remit for the commissioner. That is to be applauded
                and has our support. However, we must be given guarantees that
                when this remit is agreed, it will command adequate resources to
                carry out the tasks effectively for our children. Members have
                stressed the need for the commissioner to play the pivotal role
                in a strategy for children. If the commissioner is to be linked
                to a wider strategy for children, that must be taken into
                account. We strongly recommend the development of a strategy for
                children.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In conclusion, the fact that we need and want
                a children’s commissioner is in no doubt. I am sure that the
                vote of the Assembly will prove that. As every Member has said
                today, this is long overdue. A commissioner must now be
                appointed as speedily as possible. We call on the Office of the
                First Minister and the Deputy First Minister to advance its own
                legislation — or perhaps to seek to amend our Bill, as that
                would allow the process to dovetail — so that we can provide
                children and young people with this valuable watchdog as soon as
                possible.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Beggs:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion. I found my
                participation in the Committee of the Centre on this report
                worthwhile and interesting. I thank all the voluntary
                organisations and everyone who provided evidence to the
                Committee. It was worthwhile and timely that in the early stages
                information from the organisations directly involved should
                become available and be brought together by the Committee. It is
                to be hoped that that information will have a major impact on
                the functions of our commissioner for children.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will pick out a few issues that are
                particularly relevant and should be reinforced — issues to
                which I contributed in the Committee Stage. Recommendation 2
                talks about extending the remit of the commissioner to cover all
                those under the age of 21. Several Committee Members have said
                that there is evidence of a need for continuing support for
                young people, particularly when leaving care. There is evidence
                of low educational attainment and high rates of pregnancy
                shortly after leaving care. A cycle may be developing, and
                attention should be given to that vulnerable group so that the
                community can continue to support it and help to break that
                cycle.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recommendation 7 recommends giving the
                commissioner an ability to childproof legislation. It is very
                important that there should be interaction at an early stage,
                and the views of young people should be put before the Assembly
                or the relevant Committee. It is too easy to overlook the effect
                of legislation on young people, and giving someone this
                responsibility will assist in drawing the relevant facts to
                everyone’s attention.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Play facilities are almost completely
                overlooked in the planning process. There is little provision
                for green space for children, and little provision for quality
                play facilities, even in areas where hundreds of new houses are
                being developed. Developers are making large profits, and there
                should be a requirement, in the early stages, for space to be
                set aside for the young people who will live in those areas. I
                urge that when giving developers planning permissions, space
                should be set aside for play. It is of no benefit to deal with
                this later. It should be done at the beginning, so that people
                buying their houses know that a play facility will be built, and
                they cannot object later. Sometimes space is set aside and,
                subsequently, residents close to it decide that it is not in
                their best interests. It should be happening at the planning
                stage.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am concerned about pre-school education. I
                have raised with the Minister my concern about the requirement
                for funding of pre-school groups that there should be at least
                eight children in the immediate pre-school year. The trouble
                with that is that smaller and rural communities will have no
                pre-school funding from the Department. I suggest that if we had
                a commissioner for children, that would not be allowed. Surely
                seven pre-school children can come together on a worthwhile
                basis and learn social skills. Six children, four children, what
                is the limit? It is not the number involved, it is the quality
                of the experience and education in that pre-school group that is
                important.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We talked about where the commissioner should
                highlight areas of research and where statistics are required.
                An important point is that the commissioner should not be doing
                everything himself. He needs to co-ordinate and give his views
                to all the other agencies to minimise duplication, so that
                everyone is working together, gathering the relevant
                information, and bringing benefit to everyone.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Initially I was shocked to find that, in
                Wales, young people were involved in the selection process. Most
                adults will find that strange, but after investigation I can see
                many benefits.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The main function of a commissioner is to
                reach out to vulnerable children. Unless a commissioner can
                communicate with those children and make them feel that he is
                acting in their interests, his level of professionalism or
                skills is irrelevant. What better way of establishing that
                communication than to involve young people? I will not stipulate
                exactly how they should be involved, but they should play a part
                in the selection process.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is recommended that a commissioner’s
                term run for four years. According to the evidence received by
                the Committee, a one-or two-year term is not long enough a
                period in which to establish the office and network within the
                system. There was concern that a longer term could be
                disadvantageous if the right person were not selected at the
                outset. However, if everyone were satisfied with the
                commissioner’s performance, it would be sensible to extend the
                initial appointment. I hope that the Office of the First
                Minister and the Deputy First Minister will take this issue on
                board along with our many other recommendations.</p>

                children aged 18 and under in the North, few Government
                structures have been put in place to promote their needs. Those
                needs are great, given the fact that 37% of children in the
                North live in families that earn less than half of the average
                national income. Many of our children’s services are poorly
                funded. Our education system does not provide equality of
                opportunity, particularly for deprived children, as a result of
                which far too many leave school without any qualifications.
                Children are abused at home and neglected in care, and our young
                people are often kept in Victorian conditions under the criminal
                justice system.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is because of these problems that the
                announcement by the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister
                on 29 January this year of their intention to establish a
                commissioner for children was so welcome. After years of
                campaigning and getting nowhere under direct rule, those who
                worked with our children at the coalface finally found, in the
                devolved Administration, Ministers who would listen and act.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This proves that our new Government
                institutions are working, and that devolution is making a
                difference. I hope that all Assembly parties will do everything
                possible to preserve these institutions. Otherwise, if we return
                to the neglect of direct rule, such important initiatives as the
                children’s commissioner might be lost. All parties owe it to
                children to ensure that we do not face collapse in the coming
                weeks.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important that we get the details right
                when establishing a children’s commissioner. The Committee of
                the Centre believes that it has done that. We believe that a
                commissioner for children, along the lines suggested, would
                clearly reflect best practice and set an example for the rest of
                the world to follow.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We envisage several distinct roles for the
                commissioner. First, he would promote a culture of children’s
                rights through fostering education and acting as a source of
                information and advice. Secondly, the commissioner should act as
                an advocate for children — that means taking cases to
                establish children’s rights and checking that policies,
                practices and governmental procedures respect the rights of
                children. Thirdly, the commissioner should have full
                investigative powers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A number of agencies are already engaged in
                the protection of children. It would make no sense for the
                children’s commission to act as an appeal body for all of
                these, or to duplicate their functions.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.30 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The commissioner should be able to help
                children when other people cannot, and should above all be able
                to investigate how other bodies and agencies handle complaints
                from children. In any case, if an agency has fallen down in its
                duty, the commissioner must be able to investigate that
                thoroughly and have all necessary powers to do so. Only if the
                commissioner has those powers will he or she be taken seriously.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, it is critical that the commissioner
                is not limited to the devolved Administration. The First
                Minister and the Deputy First Minister are aware of the
                importance of ensuring that children in the criminal justice
                system are safeguarded, and they have invited the Northern
                Ireland Office onto the interdepartmental working group. It is
                vital that the Northern Ireland Office share in the devolved
                Administration’s vision of a strong, independent and powerful
                children’s commissioner.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee of the Centre listens to
                Ministers, officials, statutory agencies and those working in
                the non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to secure the rights
                of all children. As my other Committee Colleagues have done, I
                thank them for all their help. I am pleased to see that the
                Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister is
                adopting the same inclusive approach and that, to this end, it
                has established an NGO forum.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important to listen before you act and
                not, as some have done, to rush into proposals that are not well
                thought through. I hope that the Office of the First Minister
                and the Deputy First Minister listens to all that has been said
                here today, and I look forward to seeing it act for the sake of
                children and their future. I support the motion.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Gildernew:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle.
                I am delighted that we have finally reached this stage with
                regard to a children’s commissioner. It is something we should
                have done long ago. I welcome the report by the Committee of the
                Centre and was glad to be able to contribute to it at Committee
                meetings.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the junior Minister to the debate
                and ask him if there is a timetable for this matter. The
                Committee has worked very hard in a short time, and that dynamic
                must continue until the commissioner has been appointed.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This appointment will mark a massive step
                forward for society and prove that we are serious about the
                needs and rights of children and not just paying lip service to
                them. To secure the best future for children, it is critical
                that we establish a children’s commissioner from a children’s
                rights’ perspective, as opposed to a child welfare or
                protection perspective.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Committee’s recommendations
                that the children’s commissioner should be independent and
                that he or she should have an input into reserved matters such
                as the juvenile justice system. This is a field where young
                people and the areas in which they live have been badly let down
                by successive British Ministers who have looked at the problem
                in a short-sighted way. They treated the matter as one for
                punishment, without putting thought or resources into
                reintegration and the problems that this causes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although I am very glad that we are finally
                about to have a children’s commissioner, some matters still
                need to be addressed before we proceed. It is vital that we get
                this right so that the children’s commissioner is approachable
                and accountable, not just to the Assembly but to the people whom
                he or she will be representing — children and young people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another crucial area concerns the powers that
                the commissioner will have. It would be a disgrace if we
                appointed a children’s commissioner who was, in effect, a lame
                duck. We must ensure that he is properly resourced to carry out
                his duties and make a real difference to children’s lives. Mr
                Hendron said earlier that the Children (Northern Ireland) Order
                1995 was a good piece of work. However, while it was a positive
                piece of legislation, it was not well resourced. The
                commissioner must be adequately resourced.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In that light, I am concerned that in
                paragraph 4.4.4 of the report the words &quot;where other
                avenues of redress have failed&quot; are included in the
                proposals under the heading &quot;Duties and Powers&quot;. The
                denial of rights may demand immediate action by an independent
                body like the commissioner; in cases of abuse, for example.
                There may also be situations in which it is those involved in
                the investigating process who are denying children’s rights.
                We should not have to wait for other avenues to be exhausted
                before the commissioner can act. The commissioner should have
                the power to carry out investigations as and when he or she
                thinks fit in the best interests of a child, or when approached
                by agencies, groups or individuals to get involved.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Paragraph 4.4.9 of the report states that the
                commissioner should have the power to intervene in legal cases.
                It is essential to clarify whether this means the power to
                undertake third-party interventions. This power, if it is to be
                of benefit to the commissioner, must include both sets of
                circumstances.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has not been recommended that the
                commissioner be empowered to assist a child where there is a
                breach of the child’s rights. I recognise the need for a
                strategic casework approach, but it is vital that the
                commissioner is in a position to assist — including
                financially — in individual cases where the rights of children
                have been denied.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The role of the children’s commissioner is
                potentially of major benefit in the area of children’s rights,
                if the Assembly can iron out the details. Getting it right at
                this stage will be one of the most important things that the
                Assembly has done to date, and it will be something that Members
                will have just cause to be proud of.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Committee staff for their hard
                work on the report. Addressing the report’s recommendations
                will enable the children’s commissioner to become a champion
                of children’s rights, and it will empower our children —
                especially the most vulnerable in society. Go raibh míle maith
                agat.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr K Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Committee staff for the excellent
                way in which they helped us in this mammoth process.
                Congratulations are also to be extended to the Chairperson, who
                conducted the very weighty business in a fair and professional
                manner. I pay tribute to my Colleagues from all parties, because
                this undertaking is central to society.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report represents a realistic and
                common-sense approach to what has unfortunately been a blight
                upon society up to now; the manner in which we have treated our
                children — the most vulnerable and valuable asset in society.
                The report also represents a firm signpost indicating that our
                community may now address the oversights, insensitivities and
                abuses of the past and provide a future that is bright, safe and
                positive for our children.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee received 26 oral submissions
                and 24 written submissions. These came from a variety of
                statutory and voluntary organisations, which approached the
                situation in a positive and professional manner and agreed that
                there was a need for a children’s commissioner.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Trond Waage, the Commissioner for Children in
                Norway, was one of the most impressive witnesses. Mr Waage not
                only spoke of the mechanics of the commission and how Norwegians
                have been edging towards their current situation since 1970; he
                also opened the Committee’s eyes to the fact that adults
                sometimes fail to appreciate children’s view points and
                approaches to life. My Colleague, Mr Beggs, said that Committee
                members listened in awe as Mr Waage explained how Norwegians
                involve their children. They use e-government and all the powers
                they have to allow children at every level; as individuals; in
                school councils; and in local areas, to voice their concerns and
                to share their hopes and aspirations for the future with adults.
                In Norway, adults listened.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee is presenting the Assembly with
                a framework. We can do no more. It is for the Assembly and the
                Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister to
                treat the framework — the signpost — with the respect that
                is its due. It is pointing us forward. Although some of my
                Colleagues have mentioned some shortcomings in the mechanics of
                the exercise, we all have a clear vision of the future.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The submission that impressed me most —
                apart from that of the Norwegian Commissioner — was from the
                young people in Londonderry. They said that there must be a
                complete change of attitude and in ways of thinking, because
                young people and adults almost speak different languages. That
                should make us pause. It is fundamental. We are trying to solve
                a problem from an adult perspective while young people are
                telling us that we cannot communicate with them at a basic
                linguistic level.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Gulbenkian Foundation inquiry into
                effective government structures for children supported the need
                for a children’s commissioner. Some colleagues have referred
                to the United Nation’s Committee on the Rights of the Child,
                and the Council of Europe, which, in its European Strategy for
                Children, proposes the appointment of a commissioner. We are all
                agreed on the appointment of a commissioner.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There have been some sad references along the
                way. When the Chairperson of the Health and Social Services
                Committee of the National Assembly for Wales gave evidence she
                spoke about the ‘Lost in Care’ report which was based on a
                series of child abuse allegations in Wales. This event caused
                that community to stop, take stock and look at ways in which the
                situation might be redressed. Their recommendation was that a
                commissioner should be appointed. The Welsh Assembly Member
                impressed us with her submission.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Northern Ireland voluntary sector
                document, ‘Putting Children First’ represents a campaign for
                a commissioner which has been running for many years. It
                recommends that the commissioner should not be appointed in
                isolation but as part as an overall strategy, so that all
                Departments will look to the needs and vital issues affecting
                our children. It is important that the statutory and voluntary
                agencies know their roles and the areas of interface with other
                organisations to ensure that no child is allowed to slip through
                the net. The child should always be at the centre of our
                concerns.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our commissioner is going to be all things to
                all people. However, he or she must be a champion for children,
                a watchdog for children, and if necessary a whistle-blower for
                children. We cannot allow the abuses and inactivity of the past
                to continue.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am glad to say that the commissioner will
                report to the Assembly annually. That requirement does not
                impinge upon the independence of his post. It is a positive sign
                that he or she will be required to appear, at least once, before
                the Committee of the Centre. The commissioner will be there to
                be questioned; to report, and to let us review any of the issues
                raised in the Chamber so that they may be put right. I have no
                hesitation in commending the Committee’s report to the House.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Courtney:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a member of the Committee of the Centre I
                support the motion. I commend the organisations that gave freely
                of their time in providing evidence to the Committee.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson detailed the processes
                involved in the Committee coming to its conclusions, and I do
                not intend to dwell on those. Our proposals have come about
                following wide consultation with all bodies dealing with
                children and young people. We received presentations from the
                Assembly Ombudsman for Northern Ireland, the Norwegian Children’s
                Ombudsman, and the National Assembly for Wales, which has
                appointed a children’s commissioner recently. All parties
                involved made clear presentations and answered questions from
                Committee members who sought clarification on certain issues.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The results of those meetings form part of
                the recommendations presented to the House today. I draw
                particular attention to recommendation 7, which discusses the
                childproofing of legislation; and recommendation 32, which says
                that young people should be involved in the appointment of a
                commissioner, and that the Committee commends the process used
                by the Welsh Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee sought the views of young
                people, and for that reason we held a separate meeting at Magee
                College in Derry where we heard directly from young people about
                their concerns. They were forthright in their views, and we
                learned a lot from them. They felt that a commissioner could
                make a difference, because they were at a loss at times to
                understand who was responsible for looking after them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We heard the views of the Derry Children’s
                Commission, which has been working with children and young
                people for the past couple of years and has gained valuable
                expertise in the subject. I fully support the appointment of a
                commissioner, and I support the Chairperson, Mr Poots, in his
                call for the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister to
                take full account of the report’s 35 recommendations.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">3.45 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report is the result of many weeks of
                intensive consultation and is one of the most important
                documents to be tabled in the House.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The initial proposal to appoint a children’s
                commissioner has the support of all the parties represented
                here. These recommendations put the flesh on the bones of that
                proposal and will enable it to be implemented. That is why I am
                pleased to commend the report to the House. I also commend
                everyone involved, the Chairperson, my Committee Colleagues and
                the staff who worked tirelessly to get the report published in
                time.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Shannon:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I rise to support the proposal and to thank
                the Chairperson for his leadership and the Committee members for
                their contributions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There can be no doubt that there is a real
                need for a children’s commissioner to be appointed here with a
                remit to look after the affairs of young people and children.
                For too long legislation has not been equal to the goals of
                preventing child abuse while maintaining parental authority.
                Parental authority is crucial to the maintenance of social
                integrity, but it is equally important that we, as public
                representatives, do our best to ensure that children remain free
                from bad parenting, abuse, maltreatment and exploitation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Anyone who has read the report will know that
                all those who made a representation supported, in principle, the
                appointment of a children’s commissioner. The United Nations
                Convention on the Rights of the Child was ratified by our
                Government, and the Council of Europe has called for the
                establishment of independent offices for children. That makes
                the call for such an appointment here irresistible. In other
                countries where a commissioner for children has been appointed
                there was as much evidence to support the appointment as there
                is in Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The need for children to have their voices
                heard and acknowledged is crucial to the development of society.
                The report recommends working through schools, youth clubs,
                youth councils and involving IT to enable children to deliver
                their opinions and attitudes properly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is also essential that the appointment of
                any new commissioner, especially one to deal with children’s
                issues, be an integral part of a wider political strategy. The
                appointment must encompass all aspects of life affecting
                children, whether in family centres, fostering or adoption
                services, domiciliary care, private and voluntary hospitals, day
                care or child-minding services.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a legitimate argument that we could
                go too far with children’s rights. In these days of
                politically correct madness, there is every possibility that
                this could happen. To balance that, we must therefore ensure
                that no measure taken to put children first on our list of
                priorities undermines the authority of their parents. The
                minority who abuse their own and other people’s children must
                not be allowed to weaken the fabric of society. The results can
                be positive if we strike the right balance.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The role and responsibility of a new
                commissioner must be founded on a commitment to represent every
                single child on any issue brought to his office — irrespective
                of race, religion, culture, social background or whether the
                child is in or out of the care system. The commissioner should
                act so as to give the impression to every child that he or she
                will receive treatment equal to that of any other. It is
                essential to the success of the commissioner that this office be
                backed by the proper authority and legislation to enable him or
                her to pursue all cases under investigation where in the past
                there has been stalemate. The commissioner must have the power
                to carry out effective investigations and to provide and
                disclose all relevant documentation, and we must ensure that
                child services are distributed across the country in proportion
                with population.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The commissioner should be able to pinpoint
                areas of improvement and the direction of any subsequent
                strategy, and he should be capable of allocating resources to
                best effect. He or she should be able to act as a watchdog for
                children, and to assess and analyse the implications of
                legislation brought before the Assembly and the House of Commons
                which will have an impact on the lives of children. This post
                should carry the power to submit papers and reports to relevant
                bodies indicating where there is improvement and where policy
                and strategy need to be enhanced.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One issue that is essential to the success of
                the role is the commissioner’s ability to be directly involved
                in reserved matters. The remit should extend to matters
                involving the juvenile justice system with the right to
                scrutinise all reserved legislation at primary level and
                sufficient resources to complete this task successfully. It
                would be a terrible disappointment if the resources were not
                there to carry out the job correctly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another issue that must be emphasised is the
                independent nature of the commissioner. We all agree with the
                majority of those who submitted evidence to the Assembly. They
                said that it is essential for the long-term success of the
                commissioner for children that the office be completely
                independent of Departments and public bodies. The aims, goals
                and projects held and implemented by the commissioner must come
                from a base of complete and unadulterated objectivity and
                impartiality. A commissioner who operates to someone else’s
                agenda will inevitably fail to increase the profile of children.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Gone are the days when the phrase
                &quot;children should be seen and not heard&quot; was given any
                credibility. Instead, the rights of children have been at the
                forefront of political discussion and debate. It is up to the
                Government to ensure that an environment is created in which
                children’s rights are upheld, their safety secured and their
                needs met. Northern Ireland is desperately lagging behind the
                rest of Europe when it comes to the rights of children and young
                people. The children of Northern Ireland deserve better.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Unfortunately, today’s society has too
                often overlooked the needs of children. This has led to children
                being exposed to dangers and volatile situations. Children
                should be allowed to act as children and should not be placed in
                situations that force them to grow up too quickly. It is up to
                the Government to ensure that children are protected from the
                darker elements of society.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The presence and prevalence of paedophiles in
                our society has never been greater. A paedophile register should
                include the names of people who have been convicted of
                paedophile activity in the United Kingdom and in the Republic of
                Ireland. This would allow the authorities, both in Northern
                Ireland and south of the border, to monitor the movement of sex
                offenders. Although society will never be able to guarantee
                total protection of the most vulnerable children and young
                people from those intent on committing sexual or physical abuse,
                this new legislation will provide the children of Northern
                Ireland with a commissioner — a new symbol of hope for their
                future. It will send out a clear signal to those who abuse
                children that their behaviour will no longer be tolerated.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Carson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the comprehensive report, and I
                congratulate the Committee for its consultation with many groups
                and bodies. I have concerns about some of the Committee’s
                recommendations. They could be seen from a parent’s, a
                grandparent’s and a family point of view as authoritarian and
                interventionist if they were all fully implemented. It would be
                impossible to comprehend their impact on families, parents,
                teachers, social workers and even other children.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I note that there are no oral or written
                submissions from any church representatives. There was only one
                submission — from a parent’s advice centre — to represent
                the voice of parents. Were these groups asked to attend,
                participate or give a written submission? I agree with the
                Christian Action Research and Education (CARE) group that the
                primary object of a children’s commissioner must be to protect
                children. It also stated:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;It would be tragic if the Commissioner’s
                ability to protect children from abuse was compromised by
                demands that he should spend his time empowering children
                generally.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have to think about those two objectives.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The criteria for the appointment of a
                children’s commissioner will need extremely careful
                consideration to make sure that we have the right person in the
                post. The Committee’s recommendation says:</p>
                </font><font SIZE="1">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The candidates for the post of
                commissioner for children should be based on skills, competence
                and experience, with an emphasis on the ability to engage
                directly with children, rather than necessarily having a
                specific professional or academic qualification.&quot;</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am concerned about the difficulty in
                specifying the personal requirements, because the recommendation
                is rather vague. It makes no recommendation about what skills,
                competencies or experience the Committee has in mind. These
                should be clearly spelt out.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Interestingly, the Northern Ireland Human
                Rights Commission says that the person who fills the post should
                bring status and respect, and should be popular with children.
                The Western Young People’s Steering Group said that he or she
                must be easily accessible, physically and mentally, so that
                young people’s minds are relaxed. That is a bit confusing.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those recommendations, plus the intellectual
                ability required for the children’s commissioner to initiate
                legislation, will make for an interesting appointee. I hope that
                the report’s recommendations will not confuse or cloud the
                appointment of a children’s commissioner. The report has given
                us food for thought on how the Assembly should proceed, but I
                urge that care and consideration be given to all possibilities.
                We must consider the impact of these wide-ranging
                recommendations on the general family unit in Northern Ireland.
                I want us to create an office that will fulfil our primary
                objective: a commissioner to protect children in all situations.
                I support the motion.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On behalf of the Office of the First Minister
                and the Deputy First Minister, I welcome the report and the
                debate. I have listened carefully to Members’ contributions.
                They have been informative and interesting, and will be fully
                taken account of by my office as the proposals for a
                commissioner for children are developed. I will respond to as
                many of the specific points made by Members as I can, but if I
                do not have enough time I will send a written response to
                Members whose individual points have not been covered.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The appointment of a children’s
                commissioner is one of the most significant and exciting things
                to occur since devolution. It is an important milestone on the
                road away from a society mired in conflict to a shared society
                where rights are the basis on which citizens are treated — and
                that includes children and young people.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Far from being on the sidelines of conflict,
                children have been deeply involved in and affected by the
                conflict here. Of the many people who were killed during the
                troubles, over 400 were children. They were denied the most
                basic right of all — the right to life. Countless thousands
                were denied the right to a normal, happy and peaceful childhood.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Having been part of, and deeply affected by,
                the conflict, children deserve to be part of the solution and
                the construction of a new society here. The Good Friday
                Agreement has enshrined the principles of inclusion, equality,
                human rights and citizenship in the system of government. The
                challenge now is to ensure that those principles are applied to
                children and young people. It is our intention that the office
                of the commissioner for children will translate those principles
                into protection for children on the ground.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our aim is simple. It is to put Northern
                Ireland at the cutting edge of best practice in the protection
                of children’s rights. Like the Committee of the Centre, the
                Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister has
                been involved in dialogue with key stakeholders to ensure that
                its policy proposals draw on the skill and experience of those
                in both the statutory and non-government sectors who work with
                children, or represent their views.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.00 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In particular, we have striven to ensure that
                the views of children and young people are included at this
                formative stage in the process. However, I should point out that
                we will need professional, skilled help in doing that. It is not
                desirable that unskilled people like ourselves should confront
                children and demand to know what their views are. That is
                unlikely to lead to the best results. We must therefore work
                very hard to create a conducive environment in which children
                can feel comfortable and free to speak their minds.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members made specific points, and I will try
                to cover as many of those as possible. I welcome the emphasis
                laid by the Chairperson of the Committee of the Centre, Mr Poots,
                on the involvement of children and young people in the process.
                Mr Gibson, Mrs Bell and several other Members also referred to
                it. It is true that adults too often take the view that the
                whole purpose of childhood is to prepare children for adulthood
                so that they become good citizens. The perspective brought to
                bear on this situation has derived from the involvement of
                children in other jurisdictions and has led us to a greater
                awareness of the fact that children are entitled to a happy,
                healthy, secure and safe childhood without regard to any other
                consideration. Our emphasis should be on children’s happiness,
                safety and security now, rather than on what we need to do to
                make sure that they turn out to be good citizens.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also welcome the Committee Chairman’s
                emphasis on the importance of the family framework. Mrs Carson
                and others also raised the importance of the position of parents
                and the need not to neglect that position. I do not agree
                entirely with Mrs Carson’s caution in respect of the right of
                the proposed commissioner to investigate abuses and complaints.
                I recognise that such a power would have to be used very
                sensitively to avoid undue invasion of the rights of parents and
                an invasive or authoritarian impact on family life.
                Unfortunately, however, a great deal of abuse, neglect and harm
                to children occurs within the family framework. It is therefore
                essential that the commissioner has adequate powers — where
                there is sufficient justification, and with defined and proper
                safeguards — to look at the situation of children in families
                where they may be at risk.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The third important point in Mr Poots’s
                contribution was his emphasis on the independence of the
                commissioner. That is important from various points of view.
                Several Members asked to whom the commissioner would be
                accountable. The report produced by the Committee of the Centre
                suggests that the commissioner should be accountable to the
                Assembly but through the Office of the First Minister and the
                Deputy First Minister. I wonder whether that is the right way to
                go about it. Obviously, we will take full account of the
                arguments made by the Committee of the Centre, but to make the
                commissioner accountable to a Government Department rather than
                directly to the Assembly bears upon the quality of his or her
                independence. We must look very carefully at that. I am not
                saying that the arguments made by the Committee of the Centre
                will be dismissed, but there may be other perspectives. We will
                want to talk to the Committee of the Centre as we develop our
                proposals in this regard.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I liked and approved of the emphasis that the
                Committee Chairperson and others put on the necessity for the
                children’s commissioner to have responsibilities and
                obligations to all children — not just those at risk, in care
                or in certain special circumstances. That was raised again by Mr
                Gibson, Mrs Bell and others. It is important, and we fully
                intend it to be the case.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A fifth issue that arose and was referred to
                by a number of Members, including the Committee Chairperson, was
                the power that the commissioner might have to take cases. The
                Committee’s report appears to suggest that this power might be
                limited to strategic interventions — sometimes referred to as
                class actions. I am not sure that we would want to restrict or
                confine the commissioner’s power to intervene in cases purely
                within those limits. In the longer term, after we have
                consulted, we may wish the commissioner to have more extensive
                powers of intervention.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are three ways in which he or she might
                intervene: by supporting an action that is being taken by a
                child or on its behalf by its parents; by taking the case him-
                or herself; or by taking the role of an amicus curiae — a
                friend of the court who can be called to give expert evidence.
                We must look carefully at defining the commissioner’s role in
                a way that ensures that he or she has sufficient power to take
                legal cases and make legal interventions where possible.
                However, we must also ensure that his role does not become a
                power that could be oppressive or abusive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy Chairperson of the Committee, Mr
                Gibson, referred to dovetailing, which means that policies
                relating to children should have an integrated impact on their
                situation. That mirrors the thinking of the Office of the First
                Minister and the Deputy First Minister and relates to the
                cliché of joined-up government, making sure that policies and
                practices mesh together without conflict or turmoil. I am aware
                of that and assure the Member that it is part of our thinking.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Gibson referred to childproofing
                legislation as a desirable function for the children’s
                commissioner. Mrs Bell, Ms Morrice, Mr Beggs, Mrs Courtney and
                others also referred to it. I assure them that we are thinking
                carefully about how a commissioner might play such a role.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Lewsley made an interesting and important
                extension to that point. She said that the commissioner should
                not only have a role in childproofing legislation, but that he
                should also examine the practices of Departments and agencies to
                make sure that they are conducive to the welfare and good of
                children. Once again, we will look at that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Gibson referred to the need for children
                to have a voice and be able to communicate with the
                commissioner. However, should we not also think about giving
                children a voice that goes beyond the ability to communicate
                with the commissioner, a voice that would enable them to
                communicate generally and to communicate ideas? The new children’s
                parliament in the South — the Dáil na nÓg — will meet for
                the first time shortly. We should look carefully at that to see
                what improvement it brings to children’s situations and what
                improved awareness of children’s views and attitudes it
                generates.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Gibson mentioned accountability to the
                Assembly through the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy
                First Minister. As I said earlier, that has merits, but we must
                be mindful of the independence of the commissioner, and we must
                look carefully at the right way to do this.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Gibson also raised the issue of adequate
                resources, which was also mentioned by Mr Conor Murphy and Ms
                Gildernew. Resources are an important consideration. There is no
                point in establishing the post of children’s commissioner if
                he or she does not have the resources to do the job. Mr Gibson’s
                final point was that the proposal makes sense only as part of a
                wider strategy. Members should be aware that the Office of the
                First Minister and the Deputy First Minister is examining the
                role of a children’s commissioner as part of a wider strategy.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Hendron said that speedy progress was
                needed, and Ms Morrice, Ms Gildernew and others spoke about the
                timetable for carrying the process forward. We intend to have
                the consultation document on the proposal for a children’s
                commissioner ready by August, and we are more or less on target.
                The consultation period could then run from August to October,
                allowing us to receive and consider responses.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Assuming that the process runs smoothly, we
                will devote November and December to preparing the legislation.
                We hope to introduce the legislation to the Assembly early in
                the new year. We hope to have developed a broad and cohesive
                approach to the matter by that stage. I suspect that there is a
                high level of consensus on the issue. The legislation would be
                on the statute book by spring next year. It is not possible to
                be any more accurate than that about the timetable. We hope to
                begin consultation on the broader strategy early in the new
                year, and we shall consider the whole range of changes that
                might affect children. We will do that while moving ahead with
                the proposal for a children’s commissioner.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Colleague, Dr Hendron, highlighted the
                potential role of the commissioner in assessing existing
                legislation. He made the interesting and important point that it
                would make a considerable difference to the situation of
                children if existing legislation such as the Children (Northern
                Ireland) Order 1995 was properly and rigorously enforced. We
                must bear that in mind.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Hendron also spoke about the treatment of
                children in adult psychiatric units and the placement of
                children in overcrowded facilities. The children’s
                commissioner will want to consider such matters carefully and
                make recommendations to the Administration, but I do not think
                that one should pre-empt what he or she might say. Dr Hendron
                also referred to the commissioner’s powers of investigation,
                including discovery of documents, entry to premises and the
                power to subpoena witnesses. We are examining those powers
                carefully, because it is important that the office of the
                commissioner should have the teeth necessary to investigate
                complaints and reports of abuse. The commissioner should not
                simply make statements deploring abuse; he or she should have
                the powers to discover documents, subpoena witnesses, and so on,
                as these are necessary for the investigation of abuse.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Conor Murphy said that the commissioner
                should have the role of a watchdog for the rights of children.
                That is in line with the thinking of the Office of the First
                Minister and the Deputy First Minister. Mr Murphy and other
                Members raised the issue of the investigation of cases and the
                associated powers of entry, discovery and seizure. I have
                referred to that.</p>
                <i>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He did make one point that other Members,
                including Ms Morrice, referred to, and that was about the
                commissioner’s role in research. Unfortunately, we do not have
                the necessary research findings, statistics and information upon
                which to base a children’s policy. There may be a considerable
                role for the commissioner in research, and we must consider
                quite what that will be.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Morrice said that there is no need for the
                commissioner to duplicate what other agencies do, or could do.
                It is my view that it does not matter who does it, as long as we
                have the information and statistics that we need.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Conor Murphy also referred to the need for
                adequate resources and powers, and other Members made the same
                point. He suggested that we should set a standard for
                cutting-edge good practice in Northern Ireland, and that is our
                full intention.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Beggs made reference to organisations on
                the ground. I take his point, and we have already considered it
                necessary to involve such organisations. That is why we decided
                to set up the NGO forum. It has met three or four times and has
                made a very valuable input into the development of children’s
                policies.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Beggs also referred to pre-school
                education. That is not something we can deal with – it is a
                matter for the Minister of Education. We need to consider what
                role the commissioner will play in such matters and make
                recommendations to Ministers and the Administration accordingly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Beggs also referred to the need for the
                commissioner to have a role in planning children’s facilities
                such as playgrounds and playing facilities. That would obviously
                involve the Departments for Regional and Social Development as
                well as district councils, the Housing Executive, central
                Government, local government and various Government agencies,
                and that reminds us of the need for an integrated approach on
                the part of those organisations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Beggs made the interesting point that it
                would not be necessary for the Commissioner to do everything
                himself. Rather he should ensure that tasks are carried out by
                the relevant agencies and have the right to undertake to get
                them done if no agency is ready and willing to do them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He also made a point about the involvement of
                children in the process. Given the practice that has been
                developed in countries such as Norway and Wales of involving
                children in the decision-making process, it is important that we
                do not do less than they are doing in this.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Lewsley made the important point that
                devolution is making a difference. I can say without fear of
                contradiction that there is a good deal of enthusiasm for
                devolution among NGOs and the organisations that deal with
                children. Having our own Ministers has brought a considerable
                impetus to matters such as this, and these organisations are
                greatly enthused by the progress that we have made on children’s
                policies during devolution.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ken Robinson also made an interesting
                point about children from Derry. He said that adults and
                children speak very different languages and that we need to have
                professional help to understand the language used by children so
                as to bring their perspective to bear upon our proposals.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank all the Members who contributed to
                the debate. We will consider very carefully all that has been
                said to us. I look forward to receiving the response of the
                Committee of the Centre to the proposals when they are published
                in the consultation document.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Poots:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Members who took part in the
                debate for their positive and constructive contributions. The
                number of Members who expressed a general welcome echoes the
                consensus in the Committee on the appointment of a children’s
                commissioner for Northern Ireland and the recommendations on his
                role and remit. I want to pick up on a few of the points made.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr Hendron made reference to the Children
                (Northern Ireland) Order 1995 being fully implemented.
                Recommendations 5, 8 and 9 all deal with that. Recommendation 5
                says that the commissioner for children should act as an
                advocate for children’s rights and monitor the delivery of
                these rights in Northern Ireland. Recommendation 8 says that the
                commissioner for children should have a role in assessing
                existing legislation and bringing forward proposals and
                recommendations for change, where appropriate. Recommendation 9
                says that the commissioner for children should have a role in
                considering and commenting on the impact of policies and
                practices on children and young people. Those recommendations
                deal with what Dr Hendron talked about.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the cost of implementation — and he made
                particular reference to legal cases — we can only go by the
                costs in other countries. In Wales, for example, £800,000 has
                been set aside. We have based our estimates on what has taken
                place in other countries, and the cost for Northern Ireland
                should be somewhere in that region.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Morrice made reference to post-care
                services. We have recommended that children coming out of care
                should have help for a further three years, beyond the age of
                18, after they come out of care — if help is required. In many
                cases it is fairly obvious that help is required. I quoted the
                statistics earlier.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With reference to research, recommendation 20
                provides that the commissioner for children should have a
                responsibility to highlight to the relevant agencies areas where
                additional research and statistics are required and a duty to
                undertake or commission research, if deemed necessary, on issues
                of concern to children.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mrs Carson made a number of points in
                relation to family life. She had some concerns about the
                appointment process. We believe that it is important that the
                commissioner can relate to children first. Academic
                qualifications come after that. There is little point in having
                someone who has academic qualifications the length of your arm,
                but who cannot relate to children and young people. We need
                someone who can actually relate and who is well qualified. The
                ability to relate comes first and foremost; the qualifications
                are secondary.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would be wholly opposed to a children’s
                commissioner interfering in any way in individual family life. I
                do not believe that a commissioner will have the time to
                interfere in individual family life. Ninety per cent of his time
                will be taken up by 5% to 10% of children and young people. The
                work of the commissioner is going to lie where the problems are.
                If the commissioner does not address those issues, and instead
                addresses issues in which he should not be interfering, his
                accountability would have to be called into question and
                addressed. I understand Mrs Carson’s concerns, but I do not
                believe it will turn out to be a problem.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Haughey made reference to the legal
                implications and said that he thought we should give the
                commissioner more powers. The Committee felt that the
                commissioner should not get bogged down in legal cases, given
                the problems that can prevail there. The Committee’s view is
                that the commissioner should step in where required, when others
                had failed. We have had cases in Northern Ireland, and indeed in
                the rest of the United Kingdom, where others have failed and
                there was no commissioner to step in.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the commissioner should not be
                involved when others are currently doing that task. I appreciate
                the Minister’s positive response. Our focus was on speeding up
                the appointment process, and the report was intended to add
                emphasis to that process. The appointment is not a panacea, but
                it is hoped that it will address the worst aspects of child
                abuse in Northern Ireland — whether sexual, physical or mental
                — and improve children’s lives.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I express my sincere gratitude to the staff
                who worked hard in drawing up the report and to those members of
                the Committee who came to almost every meeting and who had the
                greatest input. I want to make special reference to them. I
                commend the report.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When a rule subject to negative resolution
                has been formally laid before the Assembly, a Statutory
                Committee can only approve it or seek its annullment by the
                Assembly. At a meeting on 11 May 2001 the Committee discussed
                the proposed Regulations and agreed that it could not support
                them, given the difficulties faced by the potato sector and
                farming in general. I wrote to the Minister on 16 May on behalf
                of the Committee with that message.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister’s reply of 22 May said that
                full cost recovery is the basic financial objective for all
                charging. In an earlier letter dated 13 May, giving notice of
                the proposed Regulation, the Minister’s private secretary
                referred to an Ulster Farmers’ Union request for the fees to
                be waived in 2001. He said that it was not possible to agree to
                that request. In other words, the clear message from the
                Minister and the Department was that the increase would go
                ahead, regardless of the Committee or anyone else.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a Committee we do not want to have to pray
                against that rule. I happen to believe in prayer, but I do not
                want to pray on that one. However, in this case the Committee’s
                views were blatantly ignored by the Department. The Seed
                Potatoes (Crop Fees) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2001 left
                the Committee no option but to put the matter before the
                Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I bring the motion before the House today
                with the full support of the Committee, at a time when the
                farming industry, the backbone of the Northern Ireland economy,
                is on its knees. Farmers have had catastrophe after disaster
                piled on them in recent times through no fault of their own.
                However, there is no need for me to revisit the curtailment of
                activities and financial hardships brought on farmers and their
                families by BSE and foot-and- mouth disease.</p>

                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These matters have been aired on many
                occasions in the House and have been acknowledged as a crisis by
                everybody.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Agriculture and Rural
                Development, in this very place, has accepted that farmers are
                in trouble. She has set up various initiatives to help them,
                which we welcome. On the other hand, her Department puts yet
                another financial burden on people who are already at their wits’
                end. These Regulations are a prime example. It does not make
                sense to Committee members to give with one hand and take away
                with the other. For example, the Department of Agriculture and
                Rural Development has seen fit to spend money setting up a rural
                support line for farmers who are feeling worried or stressed, so
                that they can speak to a trained counsellor. This clearly
                recognises that current policies are creating such serious
                problems that they must be urgently and professionally
                addressed. To introduce these Regulations would add to farmers’
                financial worries and create even more stress; that is
                incomprehensible at this time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister pointed out to the Committee
                that the fees increase for farmers this year would be minimal.
                In that case, the Department could easily absorb the extra costs
                and relieve a much-beleaguered community from this extra
                pressure. The Minister may like to tell the House what
                additional money would be involved for the year. She had a
                golden opportunity to send a message of support to farmers by
                agreeing to set aside any increase in fees this year. The
                appreciation of farmers would surely have far exceeded the
                additional fees collected. That opportunity has now been lost.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members may know that the Department has
                commissioned a policy review of the potato sector. That review
                is not due to be completed until late summer or early autumn
                this year. Other considerations aside, surely in the light of
                this review and the Minister’s acceptance that the seed-potato
                sector has been in decline for several years, it is not right to
                impose increases in fees this year, particularly in the face of
                objections from producers and their representatives. We can all
                reconsider the issue next year, informed by the findings of the
                review. The Committee wants to send a positive message to
                farmers — &quot;We continue to recognise your plight&quot;. I
                call on Assembly Members to support this prayer of annulment.</p>

                conscious that the Business Committee has allocated only another

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy Chairperson of the Agriculture and
                Rural Development Committee (Mr Savage):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In rising to support my Chairman’s motion,
                I believe that there is one guiding principle that must govern
                all Assembly decisions — no additional financial or regulatory
                burdens should be placed on farmers in Northern Ireland at this
                time. Farmers need breathing space to enable them to recover
                lost ground and loss of income. Following the problems of the
                devastating decade that they have endured — of which
                foot-and-mouth disease is only the latest manifestation —
                farmers need our help and support. They do not need additional
                Regulations and charges.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With so much concentration on livestock, the
                seed-potato growers are sometimes a forgotten part of the
                agriculture sector, but they are a very important part. In the
                middle of the day, everyone likes a potato. One of the principal
                reasons why we must actively help and support the seed-potato
                growers is the threat posed to them by the enlargement of the
                European Union. With new member states joining the European
                Union, the threat of price undercutting is very real, especially
                after the Nice Treaty.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We hear that land has cost a mere £200 an
                acre for over 50 years in Poland and that agricultural labourers
                are paid £20 a month — that is only one example. The
                implications of that are serious and far-reaching, because it
                will be decades before their salaries and land prices reach the
                western European minimum, let alone the western European
                average.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The threat to our seed-potato growers from
                that source is now real. We can help them by supporting the
                motion from the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development,
                and I urge Members to do that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The cost to farmers has been rising for
                various reasons. I urge the Department to cut its costs and be
                more efficient — as farmers must. I do not want to repeat
                everything that the Chairperson has said, but I ask Members for
                their support. Give our farmers a breathing space, and let them
                regroup and reorganise for the years ahead.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Bradley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As politicians we are all inclined to form
                part of the &quot;what I want&quot; brigade — meaning that we
                want as much as possible for those whom we represent; and they
                are no different. They too are keen to benefit from the
                deliberations of their politicians. The common desire often
                depends on the money available. Members of the Committee for
                Agriculture and Rural Development are no different from those in
                other Committees. We too have a lot of soul-searching to do
                before making decisions, particularly if there are financial
                implications.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the springtime I met, as requested, with
                seed producers in my South Down constituency. They recognise
                that recovering lost markets and finding new ones is essential
                if the seed business is to regain its viability. The Minister
                and her Department cannot embark on a market-seeking exercise if
                they do not have adequate funding, and that makes it easy for me
                to understand why the Department is seeking to increase its
                income — albeit very minimally in this instance — as it sets
                about establishing the necessary marketing structures.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This may not be the best time to make the
                necessary increases. The seed industry has reached an all-time
                low as far as prices and profit are concerned. The farmers do
                not have the cash to meet new demands, even if those demands are
                in their best interests. For example, in the past it was often
                the case that when the beef trade was good, the potato industry
                was bad or vice versa. The same could be said of the dairy
                industry, the pig industry, the grain trade, et cetera. Farmers
                could depend on at least one sector of their industry to offset
                the difficulties that arose out of a downward trend in the
                viability of another.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the entire industry has collapsed
                for a multitude of reasons in the last three years. At present
                there are no viable sectors on Northern Ireland farms. For that
                reason, it may be prudent to postpone the proposed increase for
                at least a year. In making this suggestion, I am tying the hands
                of the Minister in her efforts to find new markets for our seed
                producers. Nevertheless, a one-year waiver on the increase will
                serve the best short-term interests of the producers. I assure
                the Minister that if she applies a further one-year waiver, I
                shall — for 12 months at least — limit my questions on the
                marketing of seed potatoes.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Kane:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should be discussing assistance to the
                agriculture industry this afternoon, but instead we are
                defending one sector against inappropriate and unacceptable
                additional costs.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is disturbing that despite the Committee
                for Agriculture and Rural Development concluding that the Seed
                Potato Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2001 are inappropriate,
                the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development is
                persistent about implementing them, contrary to what has been
                said by some who wish those Regulations to become a party
                political matter. This is about a fair deal for seed-potato
                growers in the Province, and to turn it into anything else only
                demonstrates an ignorance of farmers’ problems.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The implementation of Regulations that add to
                production costs, at a time when farmers are desperately seeking
                a chink of light at the end of a very long tunnel, flies in the
                face of common sense. This is especially so since the seed
                potato and the entire potato sector are not subsidised. Since
                the potato sector has not escaped the effects of low product
                values in recent years, the negative effect of increased fees on
                the producer is clear.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We should be doing everything possible to
                encourage, not discourage, all sectors of the agriculture
                industry. The reasoning behind the implementation of these
                Regulations is unclear. It is no minor matter that the fees
                increase would be of minimal significance to the Department’s
                budget. My party Colleagues and I believe that the damage of
                implementing these seed-potato Regulations far outweighs their
                gain. I support the annulment of these Regulations and ask that
                the Department and the Minister give appropriate consideration
                to the views of the Committee and of those affected by these
                damaging Regulations.</p>

                I support the motion. I do not think that there is any need for
                further discussion of this issue. Our problem with the
                Regulations is that the Department simply forces them on farmers
                without taking into account the points that have been raised
                and, in particular, the year that is in it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Almost all farmers, regardless of what area
                of production they are in, have suffered as a result of
                foot-and-mouth disease and the crisis in the industry over the
                past five years. Nevertheless, whatever the cost may be, the
                Department will simply impose a Regulation so that its budget
                will not be affected. I agree that someone must pay for the
                costs of assessment and so on, but this is not the best year to
                do it. The Agriculture Committee agreed that particular
                sensitivity was needed this year when farmers are obliged to pay
                up. That is why I support the motion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the problems with these Regulations,
                and with others that filter down from Europe through the
                Department, is that their effect on producers here is not always
                adequately scrutinised. A recent example places liability on the
                original producer for the legal implications of food
                traceability and for the cost of medical difficulties when
                people are struck down by diseases such as BSE.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have noted the comments and concerns
                expressed on this matter, but I must oppose this motion and ask
                the support of the Assembly in rejecting it. My Department, like
                all Departments, is required to recover the cost of the
                statutory services that it provides from the beneficiaries of
                those services.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The requirement that fees should cover the
                full cost of service delivery where a benefit accrues to an
                individual business has been a justified feature of Treasury,
                and in our case Department of Finance and Personnel, policy for
                some time. I have considered all the factors, and I am as aware
                of the difficulties faced by the farming community as anyone
                else. However, I was unable to accept that there was
                justification for not increasing the fee at this time on that
                basis.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In particular, I was conscious that a
                decision not to increase the fees and charges levied by my
                Department, of which this is but one, would mean my having to
                fund the additional costs from my Department’s resources at a
                time when the industry made many competing and justified calls
                to me for help.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The main point that I want to make is that
                the increase in the fee is insignificant, amounting to no more
                than £5 over the year on average for each producer involved.
                The costs in Northern Ireland still compare very favourably with
                those levied in other parts of the UK. For example, even with
                the increase provided for in the Regulations, the crop fees here
                cost 34p per hectare. The comparative figure in Scotland is 58p
                and in England 81p.</p>

                and Personnel requires full cost recovery, which in this
                instance would have meant a 6·5% increase, but I decided to
                limit it to the inflationary indicator of 3%. No increases were
                applied from 1995-99 following a comprehensive review of our
                staffing and other costs, which enabled the fees to be
                maintained at a stable level for those years. However, it has
                been necessary to increase them since, as costs have increased;
                annulling this Regulation would widen the gap between cost and
                fees, which would have to be faced later. Conversely, annulment
                of these Regulations would have very significant
                precedent-setting implications for all increases of fees and
                charges proposed for other areas in my Department and for other
                Departments as well.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The need to increase these fees is not, as
                has been suggested, due to a lack of appreciation on my part of
                the sector’s difficulties. My Department is very proactive in
                trying to arrest and reverse the decline in the seed-potato
                sector here. It is not a forgotten sector, as suggested by Mr
                Savage — certainly not by my Department.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since 1999 key players have been involved in
                examining opportunities for a support and development strategy
                for this sector. Several action points are being progressed on
                the quality and image of Northern Ireland seed, supplemented by
                close liaison, best practice and exploring what can be done to
                improve the sector’s competitiveness for the home and export
                markets.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have also recently commissioned a policy
                review of our potato sector, the emphasis of which will be on
                the seed-potato sub-sector. This review will involve
                consultations with all parties concerned and will inform
                strategic decisions for the future. All factors influencing the
                situation will be considered, particularly the significance of
                international factors, including over-supply in most markets,
                the strength of sterling and increased competition in North
                African markets.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The review will also address alleged quality
                problems with Northern Ireland seed potatoes in respect of
                physical factors relating to storage, packaging and
                transportation as well as the effectiveness of promotional and
                marketing effort. This is the correct way to support the
                industry, and my decision to increase these fees should be
                supported despite the obvious populist appeal of not doing so.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is also a rebate for some tuber
                inspection fees, whereby 75% of fees representing potatoes
                exported from Northern Ireland are rebated to producers. The
                average cost of the increases to the individual farmer drops
                proportionately when account is taken of the rebate. I am sure
                that Members will appreciate the significant impact of that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In conclusion, I hope that my explanation has
                demonstrated that it was not possible for me to follow the easy
                course of keeping fees at their current level. For the reasons
                that I have explained, it would not have been right. I
                accordingly ask for Members’ support in rejecting the motion.
                If Members vote in favour of the motion, I shall reluctantly
                accept their decision. However, they will need to note the
                implications of such a decision on approving, or not, other
                increases in fees and charges which will come before them.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have not ignored the Committee; I have
                listened to the Committee and made my decision on the basis of
                the need — this is a matter of public accountability that I
                could not ignore. The additional costs incurred from not
                securing these and other future increases will have further
                implications which the Assembly must address.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rev Dr Ian Paisley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I bitterly regret that the Minister has not
                accepted the appeals made to her. I do not understand that,
                because for the past five years the Department was able to make
                no increase in these fees. As farmers are now in a worse
                position than ever, why could the Department not still do that?
                The Minister knows that farm incomes have been slashed by almost
                75%.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Agriculture and Rural
                Development could well take in the amount of money that the
                Minister has argued is not a big sum. If it is not a big sum,
                why does the Department not bear the burden? Why does it give
                the industry another straw that will break the camel’s back?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I appeal to the House to support the
                Agriculture Committee in the prayer of annulment.</p>

                Ireland) 2001 (SR 188/2001) be annulled.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the face of it most of the Regulations are
                merely updating the Seeds Act (Northern Ireland) 1965 and
                improving the methods by which seed potatoes can be marketed in
                Northern Ireland — something that nobody can object to.
                However, I am particularly concerned with two of the measures
                contained in the Regulations.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Regulation 22 will prevent the planting of
                seed potatoes in Northern Ireland other than fully certified
                seed potatoes or &quot;once saved seed&quot; from 31 December
                2001.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I understand the issues that the Minister
                referred to in the previous debate. I understand the need to
                protect Northern Ireland’s commercial markets, particularly
                with regard to seed crops and the need to ensure that the
                highest standards are applied to ensure that Northern Ireland
                producers can exploit overseas markets. However, that is not the
                issue that really matters here. High standards may be essential
                in some cases, but will the Minister tell the House if
                Regulation 22 is intended to stop individuals growing potatoes
                for their own consumption several years in succession? There is
                no justification for that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There might be concerns if we were talking
                about something that grows by seed production — possible seed
                hybridisation between one individual’s plants and properly
                certified seeds in an adjacent field. However, we are talking
                about potatoes grown by vegetative reproduction. There is no
                question of hybridisation or detriment to other growers. It is
                simply a question of whether individuals growing a small
                quantity of potatoes for themselves should be required to buy
                seed and pay a fee which up to now they have not been required
                to do if they have saved seed on their farm for many
                generations. Is it proposed that people who continue to do that
                after 1 January 2002 be made criminals? It appears to me that
                the Regulations are saying that this will be the case.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For me, the bigger issue is contained in
                Regulation 11, &quot;Genetically Modified Seed Potatoes&quot;. I
                object — and the Assembly should object — to any measure
                appearing to put genetically modified material into the Northern
                Ireland environment without a full and proper debate in the
                Chamber. That was done when similar measures were proposed in
                Wales — and the National Assembly for Wales has fewer powers
                than we do when it comes to agriculture matters.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Undoubtedly, the Minister will tell the
                Assembly that Regulation 11 is merely concerned with the
                marketing and proper labelling of genetically modified material;
                it is not permitting it. If that is so, why does the Regulation
                appear? It is putting the cart before the horse.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There may be an EU Directive involved.
                However, I am speaking as one who is probably more pro-European
                than other members of the Agriculture Committee. There is an
                issue that we must take serious note of, and we have already
                experienced it in relation to animal diseases. A free market in
                living organisms should not be something that Northern Ireland
                rolls over and implements just because a Directive comes from
                Brussels. We must think about what the Directive means and what
                the appropriate creative thinking may mean.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To pass these Regulations with their
                reference to genetically modified potatoes would be to send out
                the wrong message at this time of crisis in agriculture.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the previous debate Members highlighted
                the difficulties in the agriculture industry. I do not propose
                to rehearse all the arguments made by Dr Paisley and by other
                members of the Agriculture and Rural Development Committee. They
                have been aired often in the Chamber.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The one great advantage we have in Northern
                Ireland is our clean, green image; this applies to the whole of
                the island, not just Northern Ireland. It is a major marketing
                bonus, and it is something that we must develop to its utmost.
                If discerning consumers in Europe are looking for such a market,
                then we should be seeking to maximise our benefits. Anything
                that would suggest that we are acting detrimentally to the
                clean, green image in Ireland will create difficulties for us in
                the long term. Any question of introducing genetically modified
                organisms would damage that image irrevocably. That is my
                opinion; Members need not agree with it.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Any decision on whether to permit genetically
                modified crops in Northern Ireland should be taken after a full
                and proper debate in the Assembly and not after a Regulation is
                slipped through in a 15-minute debate at the end of the day.
                This is effectively what is being proposed by these Regulations.
                If the Assembly chooses to disagree with me and permits the
                growing of genetically modified crops, then so be it. It may be
                a majority decision, but I shall know that I am right and that
                you are wrong.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At least let us ensure that we have a
                properly structured debate and that we do not slide things in
                through the back door. Although the majority of the Regulations
                are perfectly acceptable, the Assembly, in this case, should
                reject the Regulations as they stand and ask the Minister to
                bring them back to us omitting these two unacceptable items.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McHugh:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat. I support Mr Ford’s
                position on Regulations 11 and 22. Genetically modified food has
                been a particular bone of contention for me for several years.
                Consumers and politicians have been musing over the issue,
                asking who is to blame; if there is anything really risky about
                it; and whether they should allow it to go ahead.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The driving force behind genetically modified
                food is often big business and people with no interest in the
                image of locally produced food. They have a global perspective.
                They believe that the lowest possible price is the most
                important factor, and that is what drives them down the road of
                genetically modified food. It has nothing to do with trying to
                make food cheaper in poorer countries or getting round the
                problems of famines — one of their main arguments.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The opposite has been proven to be the case
                when more damage is done to the environment, to the long-term
                future of the industry and to small businesses. Many small
                businesses will get into serious difficulties if we move away
                from a level playing field. In the United States large companies
                rule, and they move everyone else out. That is what genetically
                modified foods have to offer us.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the case of potatoes, the issue also puts
                local farmers’ options at risk. They will have to import
                genetically modified potatoes, and they will not be able to
                produce food locally that has a clean, green image.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This issue should be addressed through
                consultation and debate with the consumer and the producer; it
                should not be addressed through Regulations. We are dealing with
                major forces, and the debate today does not give us any
                opportunity to examine the issues properly. The Minister must
                see to it that local knowledge is taken into account. Consumers
                want clean products on the shelves that they can be sure of and
                that are traceable. The Regulations should be rejected. Go raibh
                maith agat.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister of Agriculture and Rural
                Development (Ms Rodgers):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have noted what Mr Ford and Mr McHugh said,
                but I must oppose the motion. Annulment of the Regulations would
                not achieve the objective sought by those Members but would,
                conversely, create major difficulties for our seed-potato
                growers and exporters, as it would remove from the Department
                all its statutory powers to inspect and regulate the marketing
                of seed potatoes. That would create a significant problem in the
                production of certified seed in Northern Ireland this year and
                would probably lead to losses for the industry in the domestic
                and export markets.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To put it bluntly, seed potatoes could not be
                sold in the absence of the Regulations. Furthermore, the
                anticipated benefits to the industry from the modernising
                measures in the Regulations would not be delivered. Concern
                about one area of regulation could end up removing all
                regulation of the sector: we should not contemplate creating
                such a situation. My Department would also be liable for damages
                for any losses suffered by the industry as a result of the
                non-implementation of Directive requirements. There have already
                been several such cases in Northern Ireland.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ford’s first objection was that the
                certification would relate to private growers: it will not. He
                also objected to the introduction of Regulations for cases in
                which we do not have discretion. Mr Ford and Mr McHugh are
                rightly concerned about the control mechanisms regulating GM
                production. If time permits, I shall explain those in more
                detail, but I must emphasise that annulling the Regulations
                would be of no benefit as they do not change in any way the
                existing statutory control measures on GM foods in Northern
                Ireland. The Regulations simply prescribe the conditions under
                which GM varieties of seed potato might be marketed in future.
                Any other aspects of GM control would, rightly, be a matter for
                the whole Executive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall explain why I am asking the Assembly
                to reject the motion and offer Members some reassurance. The
                concerns that have been expressed are already fully appreciated.
                We are all aware of the problems that have beset the seed-potato
                sector over the past few years. The Regulations are a partial
                contribution to a process that will, I hope, begin to reverse
                the decline in the sector’s fortunes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Time does not permit me to go into the
                background in detail, but I shall give the Assembly some
                explanation of the purpose of the Regulations. Their purpose is
                threefold. First, they will consolidate the 1981 Regulations,
                which have been amended on seven occasions, and make the
                Regulations more user-friendly. Secondly, we are implementing
                new EU obligations and complying with Directives 98/94/EC and
                98/96/EC, which amended the various seed market Directives.
                Thirdly and most importantly, from the industry’s point of
                view, we are modernising the Seed Potato Regulations with a view
                to developing the competitiveness of the seed-potato sector here
                and making Northern Ireland seed potatoes as appealing as
                possible to potential customers.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Leaving aside consolidation, it is the
                implementation of the Directive requirements in respect of GM
                seed potatoes that has prompted the motion. The Directive
                acknowledges that, in the light of scientific and technical
                developments, it is now possible to breed seed-potato varieties
                through genetic modification. It requires member states to
                introduce a legal basis for the conditions under which such GM
                varieties may be marketed. The Regulations introduce that legal
                basis for Northern Ireland and have no other implications
                whatsoever. They are not a green light for the growing or
                marketing of GM seed potatoes here. I have already said that
                that would be a matter for the Executive to consider before
                putting its decision to the House.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Regulations do not change in any way the
                existing statutory control measures for GM products in Northern
                Ireland. Directive 2001/18/EC requires a comprehensive and
                transparent legislative framework to ensure that the public is
                consulted by either the Commission or the member state during
                the preparation of measures relating to the deliberate release
                into the environment of genetically modified organisms.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is my understanding that the Department of
                the Environment would lead such a consultative process and bring
                its proposals to the Committee for the Environment. The
                Department of Agriculture and Rural Development’s Regulations
                therefore introduce a definition of &quot;genetically
                modified&quot; in line with that provided in an earlier, related
                European Community Directive 90/220/EEC on the deliberate
                release into the environment of genetically modified organisms.
                They also implement two provisions of Directive 98/95/EC
                concerned with the labelling and marketing of genetically
                modified seed potatoes. However, such labelling and marketing
                would be subject to pre-existing and stringent conditions
                imposed by the Department of the Environment.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that I have made it clear to the
                Assembly that the concerns expressed about genetically modified
                foods are not what these Regulations are about. These
                Regulations have no implications for the introduction of
                genetically modified foods into Northern Ireland, but they have
                serious implications for the good of the potato sector. If the
                Assembly votes for this motion, I shall not be able to prevent
                brown rot from coming in, for example, or do whatever is
                necessary to support the industry, which is in a difficult
                position at present.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Ford:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall be brief. I confess that I am
                confused. On two occasions the Minister said that these
                Regulations referred to how genetically modified crops might be
                marketed. However, in her final remarks she said that they have
                no implications for the introduction of genetically modified
                material. I do not understand that. Either they do or they do
                not. As far as I can see, a section that is headed
                &quot;Genetically modified seed potatoes&quot; has something to
                do with seed potatoes.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I acknowledged that many aspects of the
                legislation are beneficial, but I made it clear that I resented
                the way in which genetically modified produce marketing
                Regulations had been slipped into a Bill without proper debate.
                The Minister has not assuaged those concerns at all. I remain
                concerned about the regulations as they stand. I made it clear,
                and Mr McHugh also made it clear, that there is concern about a
                section of these Regulations and not about the Regulations in
                their entirety. I asked the Minister to withdraw and reissue the
                Regulations. That should be done, but if the Minister is
                unwilling to withdraw them, the prayer of annulment should be
                said.</p>

                current underfunding of the Lagan Valley Hospital in the Down
                Lisburn Health and Social Services Trust.</p>
                </font><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is a matter of regret that this motion
                must be brought before the House. Hospitals require funding.
                Capitation formulae are worked out for those hospitals. In the
                case of the Down Lisburn Health and Social Services Trust —
                and the Lagan Valley Hospital in particular — those formulae
                are not being adhered to. Thus this motion must be brought with
                the support of the Members for Lagan Valley to highlight this
                inequity. Discrimination has taken place against the Down
                Lisburn Health and Social Services Trust and the Lagan Valley
                Hospital.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the current year, under the new capitation
                formula, the trust is underfunded by £2·75 million. In the
                coming year, it is believed that the trust will be underfunded
                by between £4 and £4·5 million. The trust has already had to
                take action to meet the requirement of the Department of Health,
                Social Services and Public Safety that the trust does not run up
                a deficit.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.15 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the past the Lagan Valley Hospital,
                overseen by Down Lisburn Health and Social Services Trust, has
                lived within its means and has not run up deficits, unlike other
                hospitals. I believe that Craigavon Hospital’s deficit was
                about £7 million. The Royal Victoria Hospital has run up
                deficits year after year. Those deficits have been paid for,
                while a trust that has sought to live within its means is denied
                the funding that it should receive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The trust has had to close ward 7, which was
                an acute medical ward functioning mainly as a pre-discharge
                unit. Many of the patients were transferred to ward 1B, which
                was opened only last year to deal with winter pressures. Anyone
                who was in Lagan Valley Hospital in 1999-2000 would understand
                why that ward was so necessary. Patients lay for days on
                trolleys in corridors. Required hygiene standards were not met.
                Steps had to be taken to open ward 1B so that those patients
                would not have to endure such conditions again.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Last year was a completely different story.
                Lagan Valley Hospital was full but was capable of meeting the
                needs of the people. I dread to think of what will happen in the
                winter of 2001-02. There will not be a place for some patients,
                who will have to be shifted to other hospitals. Those hospitals
                will be unable to take them, and they will again be lying on
                trolleys in corridors.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a proposal for the immediate closure
                of ward 14. Management and staff have met this afternoon to
                discuss that. I have not heard the outcome, but staff are very
                concerned. The closure will lead to the loss of 26 beds that had
                been taken up mostly by elderly patients requiring nursing
                hospital care. The trust intends to take action that is in one
                sense evasive, but that action will not meet the needs of
                patients. There is speculation that some patients may be sent to
                Drumlough House, which is full. It will therefore be necessary
                to put people who are in Drumlough House out into the community.
                Those people are not ready for that, but they will still be put
                out to make way for patients from ward 14, which is being closed
                because there is not enough funding.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ward 1B is also under pressure and may have
                to close. In total, 56 or 57 beds in the Lagan Valley Hospital
                will be lost this year. In fairness, I must say that that
                includes 13 beds that were made available because of winter
                pressures, but the situation is unsatisfactory and must be dealt
                with.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The trust will also have to run down its
                community programmes. Anyone who understands community care will
                realise that that has an impact not only on the community but on
                hospitals, because it leads to bed- blocking. Residential and
                nursing homes will have beds available but will be unable to
                take patients because there will be no money in the community
                care budget. People often stay in hospital for longer than is
                necessary.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">New service developments will be delayed
                because of the financial pressure on the trust. There are
                several reasons for that pressure. Pay awards are 3·7%, but the
                available funding covers only 3·5%. There have been price
                increases of £250,000 for heat, light and power. Foster care
                services demand more funding. There is reduced income from GP
                fundholders as fundholding is phased out. Winter pressures will
                not be funded this year.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Then there is the cost of maintaining winter
                pressures to mid-May. There are also pressures in acute services
                such as nursing, staffing, family planning fees, accident and
                emergency security and medical record storage. These things must
                be paid for, but the funding has not been put in place. That
                leads to a situation where other aspects of health care are cut.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker, I could take you to the
                Lagan Valley Hospital tonight and show you patients lying there
                who need medical care. Beds will not be available in Lagan
                Valley to meet those needs. Many of those people have relatives
                who visit them in hospital. People regularly travel from Lisburn,
                Dromore, Dromara, Glenavy and outlying towns in Lagan Valley to
                regularly visit their family members — perhaps their mothers
                and fathers — to see them and to help meet their needs.
                Transferring such patients to more distant hospitals will limit
                a family’s ability to visit its relatives.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have a question for the Minister. Are
                elderly people in Lagan Valley of lesser standing than elderly
                people elsewhere in Northern Ireland? Is it right that the most
                vulnerable people in society — older people who need medical
                care — are treated in such a way? Is it right to deny them the
                services that they require because the Department and the
                Eastern Health and Social Services Board do not supply the
                hospital with the funding that it is entitled to? What we are
                seeing here is most unfair and discriminatory. It must be dealt
                with.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Hayes Report says that the Lagan Valley
                Hospital will have a greater role to play in the care of the
                elderly. The current process of bed closures flies in the face
                of that report. I do not accept most of its recommendations on
                the Lagan Valley Hospital, but that is not an issue for today. I
                believe that that issue will be debated at another time. Why the
                short-sightedness if the health boards believe what Hayes is
                saying? Why are they implementing a programme that is contrary
                to his recommendations?</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will not accept that the people of Lagan
                Valley are second-class citizens. Very often in the Assembly we
                hear of people in inner-city Belfast and people west of the Bann
                being treated as second-class citizens. In this instance, the
                people in Lagan Valley are being treated as second-class
                citizens. Perhaps it is not as fashionable to say that people in
                Lagan Valley are treated as second-class citizens as it is in
                the case of other areas, but it is a fact. It must be dealt
                with.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I implore the Minister, the Department of
                Health and the Eastern Health and Social Services Board to find
                the money that the Lagan Valley Hospital and the Down Lisburn
                Health and Social Services Trust should be receiving. I implore
                them to ensure that the people in my constituency —
                particularly the elderly and the vulnerable — receive the care
                that they are entitled to.</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Mr Poots for proposing the motion.
                Given the seriousness of the problem, five of the six MLAs in
                the constituency wanted to sign it. We are united on the issue.
                However, the Standing Orders state that only two names can go on
                a motion.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Lagan Valley Hospital is a vital asset to
                Lisburn and the surrounding area. The hospital and its staff
                have served the area very well over many years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Lisburn Borough Council recently spearheaded
                a campaign to save the Lagan Valley Hospital from imminent
                closure. That threat passed, and the addition of a day
                procedures unit and the refurbishment of the accident and
                emergency department seemed to show that the future of the
                hospital as a fully operational acute hospital was safe.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not a sceptic by nature, but I am not
                optimistic that there will be adequate future funding for the
                Down Lisburn Health and Social Services Trust, of which Lagan
                Valley Hospital is an integral part.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Mr Poots said, the proposal to close ward
                14 was a big shock to the people of Lisburn and the Lagan Valley
                area. Like Mr Poots, I appeal to the Minister to ensure that
                funding is provided to ensure that this closure does not happen.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Poots referred to the Hayes Report, which
                I support as a useful consultative document for the future of
                hospitals. It does, however, contain two proposals that are
                completely unacceptable to us and to the people of Lagan Valley.
                The report proposed the closure of the maternity department and
                the accident and emergency unit. That is inconceivable in an
                area such as Lisburn. Lisburn Borough Council is the largest
                borough in Northern Ireland, second only to Belfast — it is
                bigger than Derry. It is inconceivable that such an area could
                be left without maternity and accident and emergency services.
                The Belfast Area Plan predicts that the population of the
                Lisburn Borough Council area will increase from 115,000 to over
                200,000 over the next 15 years. It is unthinkable to leave an
                area of that size without those facilities, but that seems to be
                the direction that we are going in.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The funding of the Down Lisburn Health and
                Social Services Trust will determine the future of services in
                the Lagan Valley Hospital. The trust has a potential deficit of
                £1·56 million, and extra resources are needed. Several factors
                have led to the deficit, and although Mr Poots has mentioned
                those, I shall spell them out. Pay awards have been set at
                3·7%, but funding is set at only 3·5%. As the pay awards must
                be adhered to, the funding will have to be found from other
                sources or the number of staff will have to be cut.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The trust carried out the Telford exercise
                with regard to nursing staff levels. There is a shortage of 223
                nursing staff in the trust. This is a recipe for disaster.
                Considering the fact that it would cost £3 million for the
                trust to employ its full complement of nurses, it is clear that
                the Down Lisburn Health and Social Services Trust is
                inadequately funded.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other vital factors must be addressed. The
                price that the trust pays for heat, light and power has
                increased by over £250,000. Money to pay for this must be found
                from savings or an increased grant. As the Chairperson of the
                Public Accounts Committee, I am not convinced that enough is
                being done to make these savings.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Foster care services have increased, and
                there has been a reduction in the income from GP fundholders,
                because the scheme is being phased out. Although most would
                agree that the fundholding scheme was misconceived from the
                start, an interim system should be put in place to allow such
                deficits to be met.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Poots has already mentioned the pressure
                on winter beds and the fact that they must be retained until
                May. The trust is severely underfunded. If the full complement
                of nursing staff were available, that shortfall in funding would
                be even more acute. All trusts are under instructions to break
                even in this and subsequent financial years. If the Down Lisburn
                Health and Social Services Trust is to do so, it will have to
                make choices. Those choices are now under consideration.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The issue of a single ward in the Lagan
                Valley Hospital, although very important, is not the only issue.
                The Minister, her officials, the Eastern Health and Social
                Services Board and the trust must come together to provide
                adequate funding for the Down Lisburn Health and Social Services
                Trust and the Lagan Valley Hospital.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The trust now has a dilemma as to how it
                should proceed. Cuts are one path that can be taken, but they
                lead only to loss of efficiency and, sometimes, to loss of life.
                We may be seeing the last few years of the present health
                services system. That matter will no doubt be debated in the
                Assembly in future. Today we can only deal with what is on the
                ground — an over-stretched system that cannot cope. I ask the
                Minister to meet with her officials, the Eastern Health and
                Social Services Board and the directors of the Down Lisburn
                Health and Social Services Trust, as a matter of urgency, to
                resolve this ongoing and very difficult problem. I support the
                motion.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Lewsley:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the motion. Like Mr Billy Bell, I
                also represent Lagan Valley.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not need to tell the House that there is
                a serious risk that underfunding of the Lagan Valley Hospital
                will lead to severe cutbacks in services offered there. The
                result could be devastating for the local community and for
                staff morale. A recent report from the trust’s director of
                nursing has shown that it has a shortfall of 223 nursing staff.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In order to comply with the Department’s
                instructions not to incur a deficit — and because of the
                reduction in income from GP fundholders as fundholding is phased
                out — Down Lisburn Health and Social Services Trust will have
                to make savings by cutting back on services. Mr Poots said that
                in the last four years the trust, and Lagan Valley Hospital in
                particular, has, unlike other hospitals, kept within its budget.
                It is a sad fact that there was no incentive and no recognition
                of its good financial management. That only adds to the low
                morale in the trust.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The increased costs of heat, light and power
                have also been mentioned, and they are having an effect on the
                trust’s already strained budget. There are proposals to close
                13 medical beds, which are part of the winter pressure
                proposals, and to cut some of the 26 beds for general medical
                and inpatient services for elderly patients. I ask the Minister:
                what will happen to the elderly and the infirm? Where can they
                expect to go for treatment? Will they have to travel to Belfast
                and to other hospitals? What effect will this have on their
                families, many of whom already suffer financial hardship? Having
                to travel further to visit relatives in hospital will put them
                under more financial pressure.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Possible cutbacks in community care
                programmes would have a disastrous effect on the most vulnerable
                in our society. Many people with disabilities and their families
                depend on care in the community to maintain them in their own
                homes, and for respite care. What a slap in the face it would be
                for carers who are already stretched to the limit, with little
                or no recompense for the valuable contributions they make by
                caring for their families and friends.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have already seen £100,000 taken from the
                mental health budget for acute services in Down Lisburn Health
                and Social Services Trust, and I have repeatedly asked the
                Minister when this money will be returned. My fear now is that
                when it is returned it will not go back to mental health
                services but will be prioritised and given to some other crisis
                in the trust.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some of my Colleagues mentioned the Hayes
                Report, and the issue of downsizing the accident and emergency
                facilities and the total loss of the maternity services. Again,
                I have to say to the Minister that this will create further
                hardship for families who are already living under pressure. The
                Hayes Report recommends a quality of care, safety and
                affordability — I do not see much evidence of these qualities
                at present in the amount of funding being given to Down Lisburn
                Health and Social Services Trust. Unless there is a serious
                undertaking from the Department to fund services in the Lagan
                Valley area adequately, there will be no care at all. I
                therefore support this motion.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Davis:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I stood in this Chamber in 1983 when the
                Eastern Health Board produced a document called ‘Developing
                Hospital Services’. At that time there was a question mark
                over the whole future of Lagan Valley Hospital. Since then,
                during crisis periods, Lisburn Borough Council has mounted
                campaigns, which up to now have been successful.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My Colleagues representing Lagan Valley have
                given a clear account of the present dilemma facing the
                hospital. They have mentioned the problem of funding — or lack
                of funding — in the Down Lisburn Health and Social Services
                Trust, which is going to prevent the trust from carrying out its
                duties over the current financial year and into the foreseeable
                future. This is not something that the trust can put right on
                its own.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Down Lisburn Health and Social Services
                Trust has been efficient in carrying out its duties. If extra
                funding is not provided in the short term, cuts will have to be
                made in the services provided. My Colleagues have already
                outlined where the extra costs have come from, and I want to
                examine how these costs will have to be met. We all attended a
                public meeting in Lisburn a few weeks ago. Ward 14 was mentioned
                earlier in the debate, but this is only part of the dilemma. The
                options open to the trust include the closure of medical beds,
                which is part of the winter pressure proposals, and the
                reshaping of general inpatient services for elderly people in
                the Lagan Valley. These options would lead to the closure of up
                to 26 beds and compromise the hospital’s capacity to deal with
                winter pressures. This would put pressure on other parts of the
                trust and on other hospitals in the Eastern Board area and
                create a back-up effect across the board area.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other possibilities would be the reduction or
                postponement of the trust’s capital schemes and the reduction
                of its community programmes. This would lead to a further
                increase in the trust’s waiting list for community care. Such
                reductions in activities, coupled with less staff recruitment,
                delay in service development and the wholesale diversion of
                money might allow the trust to balance its books. That is not
                satisfactory. To place the service in general, the staff in
                particular, and ultimately the patients — mainly, in this
                instance, the elderly — under such strain is something that we
                as public representatives must try to avoid.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I understand, and the Minister is no doubt
                aware, that the trust has been placed in the top 40 hospitals in
                the United Kingdom. The trust performed particularly well in the
                area of patient experience. This is a tribute to the entire
                staff, who deserve credit for a magnificent effort. Those tools
                can be provided only with sufficient funding and with adequate
                annual increases to take account of inflation and growing needs.
                This debate was initiated by the proposed closure of ward 14,
                and it is good that it is taking place. However, the efficiency
                of Lagan Valley Hospital as a provider of services for the
                foreseeable future is at stake. It faces an uncertain long-term
                future, and there will be long and hard debate on the issue.
                Members and other public representatives have already voiced
                their strongly held opinions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, that debate is for another day.
                Lagan Valley Hospital must be adequately funded, and it must be
                allowed to carry out its functions in a manner befitting a
                hospital with a long and noble tradition. I hope that the
                Minister will take note of this and that the representatives and
                people of the Lagan Valley area are not being taken for granted
                as they have been in recent years.</p>

                Tuigim an imní a léirigh Comhaltaí faoi dhruidim
                thuairiscithe bharda 14 in Ospidéal Ghleann an Lagáin. Tá sé
                tábhachtach mar sin de go bhfreastalaím an deis cúlra na
                ceiste seo a mhíniú don Tionól agus cuid de na hábhair a
                tógadh a shoiléiriú.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Tá síorbhrú ar ár n-otharlanna, rud a
                léiríonn méadú ar éileamh ar sheirbhísí agus na fadhbanna
                áitiúla le hacmhainneacht i gcuid de na hotharlanna.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I appreciate the genuine concerns expressed
                by Members about the reported closure of ward 14 in Lagan Valley
                Hospital. It is therefore important that I explain the
                background surrounding the issue, and that in doing so I help to
                clarify some of the matters raised. There are continuing
                pressures on our hospitals, and this reflects the general
                increase in demands and services as well as local capacity
                problems in some hospitals.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Whereas in the past those pressures were
                generally seasonal, they are now a year-round phenomenon and
                indicative of the serious underfunding of our health and social
                services over recent and successive years. I have consistently
                stressed that without significant additional funding our
                hospitals will continue to struggle, and I hope that I can count
                on the support of all Members in arguing the case for funds to
                build the capacity of our hospital and community services.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While recognising the need to secure adequate
                funding for our services as a whole, it is also imperative to
                ensure that the resources currently available are distributed
                according to the needs of the community. My Department uses a
                weighted capitation formula to ensure that boards are allocated
                their fair share of available resources in line with the
                relative needs of the population. It will never be possible to
                fund all needs, but such an approach at least ensures that areas
                with the same level of need are allocated an equal share of
                resources.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The capitation formula is subject to
                continual review and approval, and, as a result, a revised
                formula was implemented on a phased basis from 2001 to 2002. The
                Eastern Board uses the Department’s formula to allocate
                resources to its four localities. The board’s latest
                assessment, which does not yet take into account the most recent
                changes to the formula, indicates that by comparison to its
                equitable capitation share the Down Lisburn locality is
                underfunded by £2·8 million.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The assessment has been influenced by factors
                such as the recurrent impact of phase 1 at the Royal Victoria
                Hospital, the Mater Hospital new-build scheme and the Ulster
                community hospital pilot. However, I am informed that the
                Eastern Board is committed to addressing locality underfunding
                through continued skewing of new resources, and the 2001-02 plan
                for new service funds will improve the position.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Managing with limited resources calls for
                constant prioritisation and re-prioritisation by boards and
                trusts. In the current financial year, and in planning its
                services, Down Lisburn Health and Social Services Trust reported
                that it had overspent by about £1·5 million. As a contingency
                to deal with this overspending, one of the trust’s options was
                to close ward 14 in the Lagan Valley Hospital. However, as a
                result of further discussions in the trust that option is no
                longer contemplated.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Poots stated that up to 57 beds might be
                closing at Lagan Valley Hospital. I am unsure where Mr Poots got
                that figure.</p>
                <i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.45 pm</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is certainly not in line with figures that
                I have been given. Ward 14 is an elderly-care ward with 36 beds,
                10 of which are set aside for patients with dementia; the other
                26 are medical beds. I have been told that the package of
                measures under consideration at Lagan Valley includes the
                relocation of 18 medical beds from ward 14 to the main hospital.
                This will have the advantage of ensuring that they are nearer to
                facilities that will assist diagnosis of acute elderly
                conditions. The 10 beds in ward 14 for dementia patients will
                remain unaffected. This should assure Members that there is no
                question of discriminating against elderly patients in this area
                or others.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Overall, there will be a net reduction of
                eight beds. I have received an assurance that this will not be
                immediate, but that the reduction will be carefully managed over
                time. I have made it clear to the board and trust that my
                priority remains the provision of safe and effective health and
                social services for all users. Any changes made in Lagan Valley
                Hospital will have to reflect this.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In relation to the concerns about winter
                pressures, planning for next winter is still at an early stage.
                The Department is due to meet with winter pressure co-ordinators
                shortly to discuss this and will be considering matters such as
                the Lagan Valley Hospital situation then.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Comments were made about moves to
                nursing-home care. I have been assured that the hospital
                operates a strict discharge policy. Decisions to move patients
                into nursing care are taken by a team of clinicians, social
                workers and other professionals who determine the right form of
                care for an individual and only in that context.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On deficits, all trusts must achieve
                financial stability so that my Department, like others, can live
                within its departmental expenditure limit. Throughout 2000-01,
                several trusts, including the Royal Group of Hospitals NHS Trust
                and the Ulster Community and Hospitals Health and Social
                Services Trust, developed recovery plans to achieve this aim. As
                part of the process each trust produced a savings plan agreed
                with its host board to achieve efficiencies and help balance the
                books. The majority of these plans do not affect care services.
                All trusts have also been told that deficits should not be
                allowed to develop, and if they do arise, contingency
                arrangements should be made to address them. However, I
                emphasise again that these actions are needed in great part as a
                result of the serious underfunding of our health and social
                services over successive years.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Lewsley raised the Down Lisburn Health and
                Social Services Trust’s financial management. I personally
                spoke to it about this on a recent visit to Hillsborough.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members raised a variety of points about the
                recommendations made in the acute hospitals review group’s
                report. I refer Members to the points that I made in the House
                yesterday. To assist me in considering the substantial issues
                involved, I will be inviting public and professional reaction to
                the report. I emphasise that no changes will be made prior to
                consultation.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I hope that I have effectively dealt with the
                points raised by Members today. I thank all who took part in the
                debate and hope that I have managed to address their concerns.
                My officials will scrutinise the record of the debate, and if I
                missed any points, I will write to the Members concerned.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Close:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The inspiration behind the tabling of this
                motion was, as has already been said, a public meeting that was
                held in the Lagan Valley Hospital some time ago. At that meeting
                it was pointed out to those who attended — and representatives
                from Lagan Valley were there in force — that a threat was
                hanging over ward 14 of the hospital, which is used by elderly
                people. One of the options was that 26 beds would be closed.
                This angered not only the representatives for Lagan Valley but
                relatives, friends, staff in the hospital and everyone we met
                that evening.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There was a palpable feeling of anger and
                distress that anyone should consider treating those most
                vulnerable in our society, because of their age and their
                frailties, as a soft touch by closing wards and chucking them
                out of their hospital beds into facilities that were
                non-existent.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Poots has already said that there is a
                dearth — a scarcity — of residential care beds and other
                beds in the Lisburn area. As the Minister knows, the money is
                not available in the community care budget to enable the elderly
                to be cared for in their own homes. The sense of outrage was
                palpable. We recognised that we had a short time in which to
                take action. I am delighted and proud that all of the elected
                representatives have joined together in one voice, with party
                politics put aside and people power coming to the surface to say
                &quot;Enough is enough; we will not allow this to happen to the
                elderly in the Lagan Valley Hospital.&quot;</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have heard what the Minister has said, and
                unless I am just hearing in one ear — namely my right one —
                she said that the closure of ward 14 is no longer being
                contemplated. If that is the case, then I say, &quot;Victory to
                the people of Lagan Valley, victory to their elected
                representatives, and most importantly, victory to the vulnerable
                and the frail in our society.&quot;</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This highlights an issue that goes further
                than this debate today. It highlights — and the Minister has
                already referred to it — the need for all of us to think
                deeply about our priorities. We are all elected representatives
                in an Assembly that has budgeting power and budgeting authority,
                and we allocate taxpayers’ money. It is incumbent on every one
                of us, sitting on our respective Committees, to question
                seriously how money is being spent through this Assembly.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have the privilege of holding a position on
                the Public Accounts Committee. Other Members and I have been
                astounded, annoyed and horrified at the wastage of money in this
                system. We must get it right. We are currently looking at a new
                bid procedure for 2002-03. Is it more important to the overall
                goals of this Assembly that more money be spent, for example, on
                a new computer, or on the protection of beds in our hospitals
                where people are sick and dying? Is it not more important that
                we ensure that people are not on trolleys in our hospital
                corridors, rather than ensuring that there is enough money for
                animal health compensation? It is not more important that people’s
                health is put at the top of our overall priorities, and that we
                give real and careful consideration to cutting through the type
                of bureaucracy that allocates money to a Department, where it is
                fixed, tied and locked in? Instead, we should be trying to
                create flexibility so that, for example, if there are pressures
                in the winter that would make a difference between life and
                death, a department can be opened up and money made available to
                deal with the need as it arises at any given time.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is fundamentally wrong that planning,
                heritage and animal health have priority over people. We must
                protect those who are most vulnerable in our society. I put at
                the top of that list those who have served society, those who
                have seen the passage of time and have clocked up the years in
                their life.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">They are the ones who have to be at the top
                of our list of priorities, and if we miss that, we miss our
                raison d’être and the purpose of the Assembly. As we enter
                this new era of Budget allocation, each of us has a
                responsibility to ensure that people are at the top of the pile,
                not an afterthought. We must ensure that the elderly in
                particular are not seen as a soft touch, as chattels that can be
                pushed from pillar to post. That is the message that should come
                from the Assembly today.</p>
