                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dodds asked me yesterday to rule on the
                issue of flags. He was seeking reassurances about their display.
                He stated that on 17&nbsp;January the First Minister had
                undertaken that the matter would be resolved before the next
                designated flag day. The Minister asked what could be done and
                when the First Minister would be required to advise the Assembly
                of his intentions.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have reread the Hansard report of the First
                Minister’s speech. While he gave an undertaking that the
                matter would be addressed in subsequent weeks and months by the
                Executive and the Assembly, he did not, as recorded, give any
                date for its resolution. The normal and most obvious means of
                pursuing a matter of this sort is through questions.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister (Mr Trimble):</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Speaker. I refer you
                to what Mr&nbsp;Dodds said yesterday afternoon. While making a
                point of order, he alleged that I was urging Ministers to breach
                their ministerial code. You may have had a chance to read the
                Hansard report of what I said. It is recorded on page 372. It is
                clear that Mr&nbsp;Dodds’s allegation is totally without
                substance. I hope that you, Mr&nbsp;Speaker, can, within order,
                give Mr&nbsp;Dodds an opportunity to apologise for yet another
                false accusation.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is normal practice that a Member who has
                been referred to is given an the opportunity to respond. I will
                happily give Mr&nbsp;Dodds an opportunity to respond to what has
                just been said. He may wish to put his point of order in that
                context.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dodds:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I may take another opportunity to do that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to thank the First Minister for
                giving me yet another opportunity to speak on this issue. He has
                been very indulgent over the last couple of days, giving us such
                opportunities to reinforce our policy. <i>[Interruption]</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister should calm down and not
                get edgy. It is a time for cool heads and rational debate.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is an opportunity to make a point about
                the sort of debate that goes on here between a First Minister
                and another Minister in the Executive. Where else in Western
                democracy would one find such a situation on the Floor of a
                legislative Assembly? This illustrates the kind of devolution
                that Northern Ireland has. Ministers are not bound by any sort
                of collective responsibility, in the way that Ministers at
                Westminster are. We have a First Minister rising to attack
                another Minister in his Administration — supposedly. That
                calls into question —</p>

                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am dealing with the point of order,
                Mr&nbsp;Speaker.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order. The Member will resume his seat.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The opportunity for response in this context
                is not an opportunity for a speech. It is an opportunity either
                to withdraw the comment or to say that it is not being
                withdrawn. I am not clear from the Member’s remarks whether he
                is withdrawing his comment. Perhaps he will respond to that. If
                he wishes, I will then give him a point of order.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dodds:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am leading up to that.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The First Minister has on previous occasions
                referred to the matter of members of the Executive informing
                their parties about Executive business. This is not the first
                time. <i>[Interruption]</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some Members need to calm down.
                Mr&nbsp;Speaker, I must ask you to call for order.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The order is that this matter will be set to
                the side. It is essentially one for the Executive and not for
                the Floor of this House, as the Member has just pointed out. If
                it is not going to be dealt with in the next 10 to 15 seconds we
                will simply move on.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dodds:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This was raised, on a point of order, by the
                First Minister, and you, Sir, have asked me to respond, as is my
                right.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Executive confidentiality is part of the
                ministerial code. The First&nbsp;Minister is on record as having
                several times urged members of the DUP to breach that code.</p>

                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order. I am going to rule on the matter. The
                opportunity to respond when a Member’s comments are taken up
                in this way is not an opportunity to make a speech or an
                argument, particularly when the dispute is between members of
                the Executive.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We will not proceed any further with this
                matter. We clearly have different views on what was being
                addressed.</p>

                </font></b><font SIZE="3">
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While giving notice of a motion for exclusion
                under section 30 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 has no
                specific requirements, the moving of such a motion requires that
                one of three criteria be met. These criteria are set out in the
                Act. As I have received no notice under paragraph (b) or (c) of
                section 30(5), I shall invite the proposer to provide evidence
                that the section 30(5)(a) criterion is met. I will accept either
                written notice bearing the signatures of 30 Members or the
                support of 30 Members demonstrated by their rising in their
                places, or a combination of both.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If this criterion is met, the motion may be
                moved and the debate will proceed forthwith. If the criterion is
                not met, the motion cannot be moved and will therefore fall. I
                have here the signatures of 29 Members. I therefore call on
                Dr&nbsp;Paisley or Mr&nbsp;Robinson to satisfy the requirement
                in section 30(5)(a) of the Northern Ireland Act 1998.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker, you have received a motion signed
                by 29 Members. As I understand their position, it would be
                totally inconsistent for Ulster Unionist Members not to stand in
                favour of this. Given the opportunity, I think, at least one of
                them would be prepared to stand by their election manifesto and
                what they have said over the last few days.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order. I have asked the proposer — I am
                prepared, through my generosity, to accept either of the
                proposers — to indicate that they can fulfil the requirements.
                I am not clear, from what you have said, that you are in a
                position to do so.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I believe that you will be clear if you give
                Members an opportunity to stand and be counted.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have asked, and there is no indication that
                the movers are able to fulfil the requirement. The motion
                cannot, therefore, be moved, so it falls.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Speaker. How do you
                know? If you give Members the opportunity to stand, 30 may do
                so.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order. The Member is incorrect. It is for the
                mover to demonstrate — not for the Speaker to facilitate. Were
                the mover to indicate that he could demonstrate, I would then
                call for all those Members. But I have had no such indication.</p>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is the question I asked, but, instead of
                a positive response, I was given a short speech.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr P Robinson:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Speaker. Members
                assumed that there would be some consistency in your rulings. On
                the previous occasion you did exactly what we are now asking.</p>
                <b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
                </b>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That was pre-devolution. <i>[Interruption]</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order. It is perfectly clear what the earlier
                points of order were for. Knowing that they were not going to be
                able to propose their motion, Members raised a series of points
                of order. They are fortunate to have a psychiatrist in the
                Chair. <i>[Interruption]</p>
                </i>
                <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Order. The situation is clear. The proposers
                do not have the support required under the Northern&nbsp;Ireland
                Act&nbsp;1998. The motion therefore falls.</p>
