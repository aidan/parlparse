<p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The Assembly met at 10.30 am (Mr Speaker in the  Chair).</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Members observed two minutes&rsquo; silence.</p>
    <p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="a"></a>Assembly Business</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Personal Statement</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Before we move to the business on the Order Paper, I advise the House that the  Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety will make a personal  statement immediately after the ministerial statement on the September  monitoring rounds. I caution the House that I will not take any points of order  on this matter. We will now move on to today&rsquo;s business.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  On a point of order, Mr Speaker.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. I am not prepared to take any points of order on what I said. I am  informing the House that the Minister of Health, Social Services and Public  Safety will be in the House to make a personal statement after the Minister of  Finance and Personnel has spoken on the September monitoring rounds. I will  take a point of order that is outside that particular issue.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  My point of order is about future statements to the House. This could refer to  any Member, although I suspect that it would apply only to a Minister. Whenever  a Minister is going to make a statement in the House, do they give you a time  when they will make that statement? If not, perhaps you could look at that  again with the Chairperson of the Committee on Procedures so that the House can  be helped in its business and, more importantly, so that you can be helped and  so that we can have some indication about when those statements are coming,  particularly personal statements from a given Minister.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I hear very much what Lord Morrow said. Personal statements must be cleared by  the Speaker. I have received the personal statement. I take a great deal of  time with personal statements to make sure that they say what they need to say.  Of course, we then need time to inform Whips of the issue. That is why I have  decided that the statement should be heard at 12.00 noon today, or in and  around that time, after the statement from the Finance Minister. Lord Morrow  raised an interesting point yesterday about the Committee on Procedures, and it  is an issue that the Committee on Procedures should look at.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will take no further points of order on the issue. I took  a point of order from Lord Morrow, and that is the only one that I will take. I  am moving on.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: On  a point of order, Mr Speaker.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I am taking no further points of order on the issue. The issue was well aired  yesterday, and I allowed quite a number of Members in on it. I have allowed  Lord Morrow in on it this morning, and it should rest there. I have made it  clear to the House when the Minister will be here.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I remind Members that part of the convention on personal  statements is that they must be heard in silence. Yesterday, I gave some  latitude to Members, but this morning is when it stops. I am moving on to the  business on the Order Paper for this morning.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>:  Further to that point of order, Mr Speaker, I am seeking clarification on the  way that things will be handled. I am not in any way challenging your  authority.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I am happy to see the Member or any other Member outside the House to discuss  how the issue has been handled.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Weir</strong>: My  question is potentially for the benefit of the House. After this statement or  any personal statement is made, does anyone have the right to respond? If so,  who? Is there an opportunity to question a Minister on his or her personal  statement?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  No. A personal statement is a personal statement. It should be heard in  silence, and there should be no points of order or debate on it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Unfortunately, Mrs Foster, who asked the original question,  will not be in the House, so no other Member &mdash; [Interruption.] Order. The  convention is clear: no other Member can question the Minister on the  statement. Mrs Foster has informed me that, unfortunately, she will not be in  the House for the statement. The convention is that no other Member of her  party is allowed to rise in her place.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  Could Mrs Foster delegate the Chief Whip of her party to ask a question?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  No. I am going to move on. There is a clear convention in the House. We should  now move on.</p>
    <p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="b"></a>Ministerial Statements</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">North/South Ministerial Council: Aquaculture and Marine  Sectoral Format</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I have received notice from the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development  that she wishes to make a statement.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development (Ms Gildernew)</strong>: Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat,  a Cheann Comhairle. With your permission, I wish to make a statement in  compliance with section 52 of the NI Act 1998, regarding the recent meeting of  the North/South Ministerial Council (NSMC) in aquaculture and marine sectoral  format.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The meeting was held at the NSMC joint secretariat offices  in Armagh on Thursday 9 September 2010. The  Executive were represented by Robin Newton and myself; the Irish Government  were represented by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural  Resources, Eamon Ryan TD. The statement has been agreed with junior Minister Newton,  and I am making it on behalf of us both.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council welcomed a progress report on the work of the  Loughs Agency, which was presented by its chairperson, Tarlach O Crosain, and  chief executive, Derick Anderson. Ministers welcomed the developing  partnerships on marine tourism between the Loughs Agency, NITB and Louth County  Council.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We noted the effectiveness of the agency&rsquo;s response to  pollution incidents on the Foyle system through the use of aeration and  pollution prevention equipment. We also noted the positive impact of the  regulation of the Lough Foyle oyster fishery, including improved catches in the  2009-2010 season. Ministers also noted that the agency&rsquo;s new monitoring vessel,  the MMV Ostrea, is operational and has facilitated the surveying of the seed  mussel areas in Carlingford Lough and the native oyster fishery in Lough Foyle.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Loughs Agency also reported that there has been an  increase in illegal salmon poaching, and Ministers were concerned to hear that  there have been violent confrontations between poachers and Loughs Agency  staff. A number of prosecutions are pending for both illegal fishing and  assaults on Loughs Agency staff.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council welcomed a presentation by the Loughs Agency on  the 2010 series of catchment status reports, which are produced in-house by  Loughs Agency staff. Ministers were impressed by the user-friendly format of  the reports, the range of information presented and how that information is  made widely available to the agency&rsquo;s stakeholders and other interested parties  through the agency&rsquo;s website. We also noted the practical use of this  information and how it is applied by the Loughs Agency to ensure continued and  effective conservation and protection of the freshwater fisheries and aquatic  resources of the Foyle and Carlingford systems, whether on the basis of a  localised plan or complementary to the implementation of the water framework  directive throughout Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Council approved a set of regulations which reduce the  fee charged for an oyster fishing licence in Lough Foyle from &pound;300 or &euro;400 to  &pound;150 or &euro;166. Ministers were pleased that the agency&rsquo;s stakeholders will  benefit financially through the introduction of those regulations, particularly  in the current economic climate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Ministers considered the agency&rsquo;s legislation  implementation plan, welcomed progress in its delivery and noted that further  regulations will require NSMC approval during 2010 and 2011.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Ministers noted the Loughs Agency&rsquo;s annual report and draft  financial statements for 2009, which will be laid before the Assembly and the  Oireachtas once the financial statements have been certified by the respective  Comptrollers and Auditors General.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Finally, we agreed that the next meeting in the aquaculture  and marine sectoral format will take place in December 2010.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development (Mr Moutray)</strong>: I  thank the Minister for bringing this statement to the House.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I condemn the assaults on Loughs Agency staff carrying out  their legitimate duties. I am delighted that the agency is pursuing those and  the illegal poaching of fish through the courts.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I note that the Minister mentioned the developing  partnerships between the Loughs Agency, NI Tourist Board and Louth County  Council on marine tourism. Will the Minister also advise the House whether the  degeneration of partnerships between the agency, the Department and the local  fishermen was discussed at the meeting? Will she also advise of the final cost  of the MMV Ostrea, how long the vessel was non-operational and the cause of its  being non-operational?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: I welcome the Chairperson&rsquo;s comments on  the assaults on staff. It is important that we send a message that the House is  united behind the Loughs Agency staff and the work they are doing. We were  concerned to hear that staff had been subjected to violent confrontations. The  chief executive reported at the meeting that, where appropriate, the PSNI and  guards had been called and that prosecutions are pending. As the accompanying  Minister said at the meeting, this is not a victimless crime, and we expressed  concern for the welfare of staff. We heard that among the items seized was an  air rifle. Some of the charges brought have resulted in custodial sentences. It  may also be of interest to the Committee that agency staff had been involved in  removing bodies from the river and that the agency is sourcing counselling  services for its staff, in the event that they are needed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As to the Chairperson&rsquo;s second question, on partnerships, a  lot of work has been carried out in partnership with NITB, the Loughs Agency  and Louth County Council. For example, projects at Mill Bay  and Narrow Water are now under way. We are content that those partnerships are  in place and that stakeholders generally work very well with the Loughs Agency.  The fishermen recognise that the regulations developed under the auspices of  the NSMC over a period of years have resulted in more sustainable angling on  the Foyle, and many Members of the House and many members of the community have  remarked on the benefits to tourism in an area that has been hard hit by the  economic climate. We are all aware of the loss of the Seagate factory at  Limavady and other big job losses. Tourism is becoming increasingly important,  and it is hugely important that the agency works with partners.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As to the MMV Ostrea, I can confirm that the cost of the  vessel has been in the region of &pound;830,000. There had been some issues at the  beginning, but those have been resolved successfully. The MMV Ostrea has a  clean bill of health and, now that it is operational, it has carried out survey  work and has returned useful information. I am confident that the vessel will  be useful. It will greatly assist in the provision of scientific management of  the stocks in the Foyle and Carlingford in order to facilitate the development  and sustainability of those sectors.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">10.45 am</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a Cheann Comhairle. The Minister spoke of developing  partnerships between the Loughs Agency, the NI Tourist Board and Louth County  Council. Might there be scope for other such partnerships under the North/South  Ministerial Council, whereby communities north and south of the border could  connect to ensure that the maximum amenity of leisure provision and community  regeneration is recognised? I am thinking particularly of the tremendous  potential of Lough Macrory in County   Tyrone. Perhaps a  suitable partner from south of the border could be found through the NSMC when  it next meets in this format.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: I expected some latitude and creativity  in Members&rsquo; questions, but I did not expect it in the second one. However, I  welcome the Member&rsquo;s question. It is unfortunate that Lough Macrory is outside  the remit of the Loughs Agency, which is the Carlingford and Foyle catchment  area, although I know that the Member is very aware of the geography of the  area. However, his point is a serious one: communities could come together  under the auspices of the Loughs Agency and create those linkages and  partnerships. That can work, and we will certainly look into that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Major projects using funds secured under the INTERREG  programmes, for example, are set to take place at Gribben Quay, the Foyle  Pontoon and at Meadowbank Quay. Those have been successful and important for  the regeneration of the area. I do not see a problem if community organisations  that do not fall under the auspices of the Foyle can create links in order to  meet one another and find ways that they can tap into funding. However, that is  technically outside the reach of the Foyle and Carlingford areas.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Savage</strong>: I  thank the Minister for her statement. As usual, she has highlighted something  that I am concerned about: the poaching of salmon. What is the Department doing  to help encourage and promote angling activities across loughs and rivers in Northern Ireland?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: The Member is aware that the Department  of Culture, Arts and Leisure is the key agency that deals with coarse and  inland waterway fishing. The Loughs Agency is responsible for the Foyle and  Carlingford catchment areas and to that end has worked hard with our fishing  stakeholders. A management system is now in place whereby, if fish counters are  not recording adequate numbers of salmon, a temporary restriction can be placed  on other types of fishing to ensure the retention of salmon in those rivers. It  is important that the correct management tools are used; that the information  is available to the Loughs Agency to make those decisions; and that there is  sustainability of fishing in that area. However, there are other areas outside  of the control of the Loughs Agency.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We hear about Atlantic survival and the rates of fish  returning to an area. The research work that Loughs Agency staff have done has  been hugely informative and interesting. It states that fish traditionally come  back to the same river. There is a specific gene in the fish that can identify  the River Faughan or the River Roe, which is fascinating. We are looking at  ways in which we can ensure the safety and spawning ability of fish when they  are in our rivers. The unknown factor in that is that we do not know when they  will come back, so we have to monitor fish levels in our rivers carefully and  ensure that they are not overfished. Concerns over the sustainability of coarse  fishing have been raised with the Culture Minister, but again, that is outside  the remit of the NSMC aquaculture sector.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P J Bradley</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her statement. She stated that the agency&rsquo;s new  monitoring vessel, the MMV Ostrea, is now operational and has facilitated the  surveying of the seed mussel areas in Carlingford Lough. In early summer, I  wrote to the Minister with regard to the threat of disease to the mussel stock  of Carlingford Lough. A fear was expressed to me that North/South co-operation  was not all that it could have been. Was there any discussion on the very  serious disease threat in Carlingford Lough?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: I assure the Member that we are doing  everything that we can to identify possible disease outbreaks in the Foyle and  Carlingford catchments and disease at any level, whether animal, plant or fish.  We take the threat of disease very seriously. I assure the Member that my  Department has an excellent working relationship with DAFF. Work is being done  to ensure that we have proper controls to mitigate disease outbreaks. There is  full co-operation. As the Member pointed out, if there was no North/South  co-operation in Carlingford Lough, there would not be any kind of activity  there, as it divides the two jurisdictions. Co-operation is absolutely  necessary. I assure the Member that all is being done to contain every kind of  disease, to ensure that proper scientific studies are done on those and to  develop a sustainable fishery in the Carlingford area.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her statement, in which she said that the Council  approved regulations that reduced the fee from some &euro;400 to &euro;166. That is  certainly a hell of a reduction in the fee, and I have no doubt that the  stakeholders will be pleased. Surely, however, that size of reduction must  leave a gap somewhere else in the system? Will the Minister explain how she  will fill that gap?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: When the regulation was set down,  thought was given to how many licences would be issued. The number of licences  has stabilised over the past number of years, and about twice as many licences  as were expected have now been issued. To make it more affordable and yet to  still cover our administrative costs in delivering the licences, it was decided  that the fee would be reduced.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The agency has been very proactive. Rather than accepting a  windfall, it identified the number of licences issued year on year and the  amount of money that it expected to receive, and it decided that there was no  need to charge stakeholders double the fee. There is not a gap as such; the  agency has received the amount of money for which it hoped. More than that  amount has been coming in over the past number of years, so it was decided to  scale that back. If the number of licences remains on the current plateau, our  fees will be covered, and we will not ask fishermen to dig deeper into their  pockets than they need to.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Molloy</strong>: I  thank the Minister for her statement. It is an important statement,  particularly as regards the link between the two jurisdictions. Is there any  indication of how beneficial salmon fishing has been to the tourism industry in  the past year?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: There is a figure for the economic  benefit of every fish that is caught. I do not have that with me, but I am  happy to provide that to the Member in writing.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Dallat</strong>: I  return briefly to the issue of partnerships. I envy the partnership between the  North and County Louth. I am sure that the Minister and  the House will agree that there is enormous potential in the Foyle and Bann  areas of the north-west for partnerships with Inishowen, where the future of  the ferry service is in some doubt because of financial difficulties. Will the  Minister assure us that, in future meetings, there will be a focus on that  area? As she said this morning, there has been high unemployment in Limavady,  but there is enormous potential for tourism development, particularly marine  tourism.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: I welcome the Member&rsquo;s question, but I  probably cannot give him the full assurances that he is looking for today  because, although the NSMC meetings in aquaculture and marine sectoral format  take place regularly, the Council discusses the areas for which it has  responsibility. The ferry is outside the Loughs Agency&rsquo;s control and  responsibility. Therefore, the matter has not been discussed at those meetings.  The ferry remains under the auspices of the Department that has responsibility  for it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We recognise the importance of partnerships. As I said to  Mr McElduff, we recognise the importance of working together. We have  identified and shown that we work not just with tourism agencies but, as  Members have witnessed, with bodies such as Louth County Council. We welcome  any further partnership working that enhances the overall economic well-being  of the areas under discussion. The chief executive of the Loughs Agency, Derick  Anderson, and its chairperson, Tarlach O Crosain, are always proactive, but they  are bound by their responsibilities.<span style="font-family:'ITC Franklin Gothic Demi'; font-size:12.0pt; "> </span></p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading"><a name="c"></a>Public Expenditure: September Monitoring 2010-11</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I have received notice from the Minister of Finance and Personnel that he  wishes to make a statement.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel (Mr S Wilson)</strong>: Thank you, Mr Speaker, for the  opportunity to update the Assembly on the outcome of the September monitoring  process.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The starting point for this monitoring round was the  outcome of the June monitoring round, which I reported on earlier this month.  Members will be aware that June monitoring concluded with an effective  overcommitment of &pound;45&middot;1 million in current expenditure and &pound;10&middot;6 million in  capital investment. That overcommitment was a direct result of the &pound;127&middot;8  million reduction in funding that the UK Government imposed in the June Budget.  Although the Executive have the option of deferring our share of the UK  Government&rsquo;s public expenditure reduction until the next financial year, I am  of the strong view that we need to deal with it now. The key issue is that, in  the 2010 UK  spending review, we will see a further tightening in the public expenditure  environment, and we cannot allow that 2010-11 pressure to extend into the next  financial year. In the September monitoring round, therefore, the Executive&rsquo;s  focus has been on managing down the overcommitment, as opposed to meeting a  substantial number of bids from Departments.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Before I go on to the outcome of September monitoring, I  will highlight the level of reduced requirements surrendered and the bids that  Departments submitted. Departments surrendered only &pound;7&middot;7 million of current  expenditure and &pound;18&middot;1 million of capital investment in reduced requirements  respectively. At this point in recent financial cycles, that is the lowest  level of reduced requirements. Details of those reduced requirements are set  out in the tables attached to the written version of my statement.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Three other issues that impacted on the resources available  during this monitoring round also came to light. First, a recalculation of the  interest requirement to service our reinvestment and reform initiative (RRI)  borrowing resulted in a further &pound;2&middot;8 million of current expenditure being made  available. Secondly, the latest regional rate collection projection, which Land  and Property Services (LPS) conducted, showed a significant increase on the  June position. That partly resulted from the extra money allocated to LPS in  the June monitoring round. Given that latest assessment, a further &pound;10&middot;6  million has been made available. Finally, June monitoring identified a pressure  related to a shortfall in our end-year flexibility (EYF) capital stock.  However, after further negotiation with the Treasury, my officials have secured  full access to our EYF claim for this financial year, and that frees up another  &pound;7&middot;3 million of current expenditure and &pound;900,000 of capital expenditure.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In addition to the reduced requirements, the Executive  allow Departments to move resources across spending areas when such movement  reflects a proactive management decision taken to enable the Department to  better manage emerging pressures in its existing baselines.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That is to facilitate better financial management,  and Departments that have made use of the mechanism should be commended for  their efforts to deal with emerging pressures. It has also been necessary, due  largely to technical issues, to reclassify some amounts between different  categories of expenditure. Details of all those changes are provided in the  tables attached to written copies of this statement.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.00 am</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The net result of those transactions, taking account of the  June monitoring outcome, was to reduce the level of overcommitment in current  expenditure to &pound;16&middot;7 million; similarly, the net position for capital  expenditure resulted in &pound;8&middot;4 million being made available to the Executive for  allocation. Against that net position, Departments submitted current  expenditure bids of &pound;77&middot;9 million and capital investment bids of &pound;83 million.  Some of those bids reflected pressures that were identified but not met as part  of the June monitoring round. Full details of departmental bids are also  attached to written copies of this statement.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Based on the tight in-year position, the greatly reduced  level of money surrendered and the need to address the &pound;127&middot;8 million reduction  imposed by the UK Government this year, the Executive agreed not to meet any  current expenditure bids. The only exception was a small allocation to the  Northern Ireland Audit Office to cover a pressure in respect of depreciation  costs. That bid was met because the Audit Office&rsquo;s requests for resources are  normally honoured automatically.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Members should also note that the equal pay issue is  imposing additional uncertainty to the in-year financial position. Payments are  being progressed, and, although my Department holds financial cover for the  estimated liability, there is a risk that the outcome may exceed the current  estimate. The Executive have agreed that allocations to Departments for equal  pay will be processed in December, when the final position will be known. The  approach, which was agreed by the Executive, resulted in a residual current  expenditure overcommitment of &pound;16&middot;8 million, which will have to be managed in  the two remaining monitoring rounds this year.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">With respect to capital funding, &pound;8&middot;4 million was available  for allocation, which allowed the Executive to agree allocations to six  Departments. I shall draw attention to the two largest allocations: &pound;3&middot;2  million was allocated to the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure (DCAL) to  cover a shortfall in receipts associated with the planned sale of the Public  Record Office of Northern Ireland (PRONI) site at Balmoral; and &pound;2&middot;8 million  was allocated to the Department for Employment and Learning (DEL) for essential  health and safety works in the further education estate in order to ensure  compliance with health and safety regulations. In addition to those  allocations, some relatively small amounts of capital money went to the  Department of Finance and Personnel (DFP), Department for Social Development (DSD),  Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister (OFMDFM) and Department  of the Environment (DOE). Full details of those allocations are attached to  written copies of this statement.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In total, capital investment resources were exhausted in  this monitoring round, the outcome of which leaves the Executive with a zero  capital overcommitment. In conclusion, the approach adopted by the Executive in  the monitoring round has been, first and foremost, to address the residual  pressure resulting from our share of the UK Government&rsquo;s &pound;6 billion public  expenditure reduction in this financial year.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I believe that, at this stage of the financial year, an  overcommitment of &pound;16&middot;8 million in current expenditure is manageable. However,  given the remaining financial uncertainties and the public expenditure outlook,  it is necessary not to increase that level of overcommitment further. The  capital funding outcome left the Executive with no overcommitment, which we  agreed was prudent, given the very low levels of money surrendered by  Departments in the monitoring round. A less conservative approach would create  a material risk that the Executive would have to impose further in-year  reductions later in the financial year, when Departments would have little time  to adjust. That is a risk that we were simply not prepared to take.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Nevertheless, the decision to adopt that approach was not  taken lightly, since it left many Ministers disappointed. There are many areas  in which we would have liked to have done more, and there are many ongoing  financial pressures.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The upshot of that approach is that Ministers must now take  urgent action to live within their existing budgets. They will have to identify  where efficiencies and savings can be made and prioritise their spending plans to  ensure that limited resources are put to the best possible use. That is true  not only for this current year but for the upcoming Budget period. We are all  aware of the tough times that lie ahead. It is imperative that the Executive  work together to tackle the difficult financial decisions facing us. We must  ensure that increasingly scarce resources are used in the best possible way to  achieve the maximum benefit for the people of Northern Ireland. I commend the  September monitoring round to the Assembly.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for Finance and Personnel (Ms J McCann)</strong>: Go raibh maith  agat, a Cheann Comhairle. I thank the Minister for his statement and apologise  to him for missing the beginning of it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister said that, as a result of negotiations with  the Treasury, an additional &pound;7&middot;3 million in current expenditure and &pound;0&middot;9  million in capital expenditure is now available. Can he clarify what the total  level of existing current and capital end-year flexibility is? Can he now  assure the House that the Executive have full access to current and capital  stocks?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: At the moment, I cannot give the Chairperson the  level of end-year flexibility that we have. I will put that figure in writing  to her. We have been given the ability to draw down the money that was  available to us in this Budget round. We will, of course, continue to negotiate  with the Treasury to ensure that we have full access to that end-year  flexibility. I am not too sure about the exact figure, although I may be able  to get it before the end of this item of business, and if I can, I will. If  not, I will write to the Chairperson.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  Given the way in which monitoring rounds appear to be developing in this  financial year and the concern that that will inevitably cause over public  spending, what further discussions has the Minister had with the Treasury about  the developing budgetary position for Northern Ireland in the years ahead? What  devices or mechanisms might the Treasury introduce to stimulate the private  sector in Northern Ireland,  as the now Prime Minister and the Secretary of State promised before the recent  general election?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I meet Treasury Ministers constantly, as do my  officials with their Treasury counterparts, to discuss the current position in Northern Ireland  and the pressures that we will face over the next number of years. I know that  there have been suggestions that, somehow or other, we are simply rolling over  and accepting the current position, but nothing could be further from the  truth. However, we have to balance that against the reality, which is that we  face a difficult position and therefore need to plan for it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, in discussions with the Treasury, we have, first,  highlighted the unique position of Northern   Ireland, its dependence on public sector spending, our  position in the economic cycle and the particular difficulty that we have with  the banking system in Northern    Ireland. Those, I believe, present special  circumstances. Other Ministers in other regions have done the same. Secondly,  over the summer, we had discussions with the Secretary of State and the  Treasury on the package to help to rebalance the economy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Thirdly, there have been negotiations with the Treasury,  which, I hope, will come to a successful conclusion, on the Barnett  consequentials that were imposed on Northern Ireland for the policing  budget. The imposition of the Barnett consequentials led to a reduction of &pound;23  million in that budget. We believe that the consequentials were not properly  applied, and if that situation can be dealt with, not only will &pound;23 million be  available this year but the baseline for the policing budget will increase.  Furthermore, there is the possibility of making a case to the Treasury for some  access to the money that is available for policing for national security.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We are continually talking to the Treasury about a range of  issues and are fighting for every penny that we can get for Northern Ireland.  That is the right thing to do while, at the same time, planning for what we  know is inevitable.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  I welcome the turnaround on rates collection. Perhaps the Minister will expand  on how he will invest, in money terms, that significant increase in received  revenue. Will he confirm whether he is content that all Departments have fully  declared their reduced requirements at this time?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: The picture on rates collection is improving. The  Member has, quite rightly, been critical of Land and Property Services in the  past, as I have, and that situation needed to be turned around. For a small  investment of &pound;5 million in the June monitoring round, we have been able to put  additional resources into identifying properties, dealing with revaluations and  some other backlogs. That has given us &pound;10 million. I also point out to the  Member that, although it does not have any financial consequence for us this  year, the level of debt this year so far has been brought down from &pound;157  million, which was far too high, to &pound;121 million. That, of course, will have a  revenue consequence in future because we will not have to set as much money  aside for bad debt.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">His second question was about the reduced requirements. At  present, all that we can do is to listen to what Ministers say and consider the  reduced requirements that they bring to the table. However, as he will expect,  my officials talk to officials in other Departments, and the indications are  that no massive reduced requirements are lurking in Departments at present that  will suddenly come to the table in either December or February. We try to avoid  that because, at the end of the year, it is much more difficult to spend the  money. However, we are not aware of any huge reduced requirements. That  represents a tightening of the fiscal situation and it is one reason why I was  very keen to bring down the overcommitment as quickly as possible.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his statement. In the previous monitoring round, the  Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety (DHSSPS) identified an  underspend on swine flu that, if memory serves me right, totalled in excess of  &pound;15 million. The suggestion at that time was that that needed to be banked  because of some financial rule. Has that money become available in this round?  If so, is it factored into the figures?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: The money that was not spent by the Department of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety on swine flu was declared surplus to  requirements at the end of the previous financial year in the February  monitoring round. At that stage, all Departments &mdash; apart from, if my memory  serves me right, the Department of Education &mdash; said that they could not spend  the money. Therefore, it had to be returned to the Departments that made the  contributions, and we indicated that we would bring it back in the June  monitoring round. That has been done, and the money has been rightfully  allocated to Departments. It was their money in the first place; they were  top-sliced to make an allocation to deal with that incident. Once it was not  spent, it had to go back to Departments.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  welcome the timely statement although I suspect that it somewhat represents the  calm before the storm. Will the Minister confirm whether he intends to clear  the entire &pound;128 million pressure during this financial year?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I come back to the point about reduced requirements. There  seems to be a pattern that our flexibility is entirely based around Departments  surrendering major capital schemes, and there is an issue with the timeliness  of that. For example, both of the projects that are cited in the Department of  Culture, Arts and Leisure figures are ones for which, as I understand it, the  money could have been released some time ago. The Minister may wish to address  that timeliness issue with Departments.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: The Member asked about the timeliness of reduced  requirements from Departments. That is emphasised to Departments regularly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Indeed, I hope that it was a salutary lesson to  Departments. If money is held deliberately until the end of the year, we may  have to conduct the same exercise that we conducted with DHSSPS last year and  say that the Department will not get to hold on to the money but will get hit  at the start of the next financial year because we will require the money to be  repaid. All Departments will benefit from reduced requirements being identified  early and returned to the pot so that the money can be used for the most  pressing needs. That is a discipline that all Ministers need to abide by,  because, collectively, it is in their interest to do so.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.15 am</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although we can, it is my intention not to carry into next  year the overcommitment from the budgetary cuts that were imposed in June.  Given the tightness of next year&rsquo;s position, we do not want to add to that  overcommitment any further. Thus far, we have done well to manage the  overcommitment down to its current level, and I am hopeful that, by the end of  the financial year, we can manage it down to zero both on current and capital  expenditure.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Frew</strong>: How  does the Minister feel that the Executive are working together on the matter,  and does he feel that Ministers realise that cuts will have to be made and that  it is better to deal with most of the pressures now?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I have emphasised time and time again that, in  planning for next year&rsquo;s Budget, it is important that, first, we have a  strategic picture of what we want to do. That includes consideration of issues  such as where we want to direct expenditure, whether we want to raise revenue  and, if so, how we wish to raise it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In addition to those big strategic decisions, Ministers  will look at their budgets and ask themselves whether they can find  efficiencies. One does not find efficiencies at the last minute: some planning  must be done. Ministers will have to consider whether they should give low  priority to some areas of their budget and whether they should stop spending  altogether on other areas because of the general direction in which we want to  take the economy in Northern    Ireland and because of the financial  constraints that are on us.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A whole range of issues requires early sitting down and  engagement among members of the Executive to get a broad picture of the  direction in which we want to go, followed by discussion at departmental level  so that we can allocate money to the important areas of departmental expenditure.  As I have said before, we have not engaged properly as yet, but hopefully we  will in the near future.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Chairperson  of the Committee for the Environment (Mr Boylan)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a  Cheann Comhairle. I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s statement. As the Minister will be  aware, the Committee for the Environment supported the Department of the  Environment&rsquo;s September monitoring round bid and welcomes the small amount of  capital funding that he has allocated the Environment Agency for equipment and for  health and safety works. However, the Committee was most concerned that the  Department had identified a need for additional funds to cover the costs of  staff who have yet to be relocated from the Planning Service but who, owing to  planning receipt shortfalls, can no longer be afforded. How will those costs be  covered?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: There are two ways in which the costs can be  covered. First, as I say to all Departments, they should deal with unmet bids  by looking at their budgets to see how money might be reallocated and how  changes might be made. As I pointed out in my statement, where there is  proactive management of budgets, reclassifications of expenditure will be  allowed, if the Minister makes a case for doing that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The second way involves taking a bit of a chance, because  we do not know what the picture will be. Departments will be capable of making  bids in the December and February monitoring rounds. I understand that that  leaves the bids until later in the year and that there is no guarantee that any  money will be available, or, indeed, that bids that a particular Department  makes will be given priority. The first and most important step should be to  look at existing budgets and to decide whether, if something is considered to be  a massive pressure, there are other areas from which money can be taken.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Girvan</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his statement. In light of the commitment that Ministers  and Departments must give to the Executive, what has been the level of buy-in  from Departments on committing to the necessary cuts, based on the  understanding that we must find &pound;126 million or &pound;127 million this year, never  mind next year?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: The good news is that we have found nearly all of  the &pound;127 million this year, and we are down to &pound;16&middot;8 million. I believe that we  can and should manage it within the existing year. As far as next year is  concerned, I have made it clear that I am disappointed at the level of  engagement so far. I do not think that we can continue without stepping up to  the mark. However, that must be done collectively because, at the end of the  day, the Budget has to be agreed collectively by the Executive. There is no  point in an individual Minister&rsquo;s saying that we can progress with the Budget  as much as we want but that he or she will vote against it. The issues are far  too important.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">People tell me that they want some certainty. They know  that pain is coming, and they expect us to behave responsibly so that when we  come to form the Budget, it will not be formed as some last-minute,  thrown-together, cobbled compromise that wastes money. Rather, it should be  constructed and presented in a way that shows some strategic thinking by the  Executive.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I want to follow up on the Minister&rsquo;s answer to a colleague, in which he talked  about his communications with the Treasury. He was keen to emphasise that we  were not rolling over and that we would fight our case. He talked about the  particular banking requirements here. Will the Minister outline his assessment  of the dangers posed by the situation that is about to develop at the Anglo  Irish Bank, the potential failure of the Irish Government&rsquo;s bond markets and  the possibility of their running to the International Monetary Fund (IMF)? The Minister  said that, given the &ldquo;remaining financial uncertainties&rdquo; and the &ldquo;public  expenditure outlook&rdquo;, he had been meaning to examine those matters. Has the  Minister considered them in detail? If so, has he shared those concerns with  the Treasury?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: The Member knows that banking is not a devolved  issue. Therefore, the role that the Executive have to play in banking is more  one of liaising with the Treasury in England or the Finance Minister in  the Republic, and I have done both.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to the Irish banks, I have met and will  continue to meet and communicate regularly with the Minister responsible for  finance in the Republic. As a result of those representations, there is now an  advisory panel, which includes two members from Northern Ireland. The panel  specifically examines the kind of issues that may arise as a result of the  activities of NAMA, the Irish banks and the Northern Ireland economy. We have  two good representatives on the board, and they keep me informed. In addition,  I continue to meet officials from NAMA, as I did over the summer, to discuss  some of the concerns that the Member expressed about loans being taken on and  the impact of the financial situation on the Irish banks.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member is right: the situation is extremely fragile. I  also meet representatives from the individual banks. In the past two weeks, I  met representatives of the First Trust Bank, which is a subsidiary of the  Allied Irish Bank, to discuss banking issues. The Member knows that we do not  have any powers to direct the banks. It is important, however, to highlight the  problems, share the intelligence and try to find out what is being done to deal  with the issues.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As far as the Treasury is concerned, that relates mostly to  the activities of the Ulster Bank. The Department has access to Treasury  officials and takes cases to the banking panel. The Department also receives  regular updates on what is being done on bank lending, makes the case and tries  to offer the local picture. Lack of lending by the banks is not unique to Northern Ireland.  Indeed, I hear Members of the House of Commons complaining regularly about the  activities of banks in England,  Scotland and Wales and the  lack of lending to businesses. At a Treasury level, there is some frustration,  and the Department fills in the picture from a Northern Ireland perspective. Those  are the types of things that it can do.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  The Minister raised the issue of banks. During a joint meeting of the Committee  for Enterprise,  Trade and Investment and the Committee for Finance and Personnel last week, it  was made clear that ordinary customers are not being well served by the banks.  Many have been refused proper credit facilities, and, when they are granted,  they are restrictive and sometimes punitive. Did the Minister raise those  issues with the banks, and, if so, what was their reaction?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">On his discussions with the Treasury, the Minister,  although he may not have wanted to do so, gave the public and the Assembly the  impression that he has accepted the proposed savage cuts with resignation &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I encourage the Member to finish.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  The Minister has not given a robust defence of the special circumstances in Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: The Member will be aware that I am not known for a  lack of robust responses. Indeed, on occasions, I get into trouble in that  area. Of course the case has been made; at the last meeting that we had with  Danny Alexander in the Treasury, the case was also made by Jane Hutt, the Welsh  Finance Minister, and John Swinney, the Scottish Finance Minister. We all  emphasised the timing and depth of the cuts and the impact that they are likely  to have on regions of the United Kingdom that have special features, or features  that are not common to the southern part of England.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member must bear in mind that an acceptance of the  position that we are in does not mean that we are resigned to it. We must accept  the reality; we cannot bury our heads in the sand and hope that it will not  happen. The extent may vary, but we know that huge financial cuts will be  imposed on Northern Ireland  and on other parts of the United    Kingdom, and we must prepare for those. That  is not resignation, rolling over or surrendering. That is doing the job that  everyone expects me to do as Finance Minister. If I were not doing that, the  Member would have more justification for criticising the position that I have  adopted.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As far as the banks are concerned, the Member has rightly  identified some of the issues that people have brought to my attention. Those  include the arbitrary nature of the changes in the terms and conditions that  the banks impose, the cost of finance and the unwillingness to finance certain  ventures. The banks&rsquo; response to me was that it now costs them more for raw  materials and deposits, and, therefore, they are charging savers more. As far  as the arbitrary changes are concerned, the banks tell me that they are obliged  to give notice when they make changes in terms and conditions so that people  have the opportunity to discuss those and to try to rejig them. However,  stories have come back that that has not always been the case</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">They have also said that we are moving away from  the days of businesses doing most of their financing through bank loans and,  therefore, that businesses will have to look more at equity finance. That is  the direction of travel that the monetary system is going in, and that will, of  course, be a big adjustment for many small businesses here in Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The case has been put often. For example, the day before I  saw them, the banks had met the Churches. A whole host of people are raising  issues such as those which the Member raised with the banks.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.30 am</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  I apologise to the Minister for not being here for the commencement of his  statement. I was attending another meeting in the Building.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We need clarification on the cost of the PSNI hearing loss  claims. I want to refer to a briefing paper that was presented to the Committee  for Justice in August. Will the Minister outline the figures involved? A number  of figures are being kicked about, and we need to ascertain exactly where all  those figures come into place. We have been advised that there was a forecast  for 2010-11 in which the cost of police hearing loss claims would be &pound;29&middot;8  million.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I encourage the Member to come to his question.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Lord Morrow</strong>:  That is part of my question. Will the Minister outline what progress has been  made between the Executive and the Treasury regarding the Treasury acquiring  saleable assets to assist the Executive to meet the first &pound;12 million of the  cost of hearing loss claims? Will he confirm that the remaining &pound;17&middot;8 million  has been provided for from the reserve fund? Will he tell us how much has been  allocated or paid out to date?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: We are wandering well away from the September  monitoring round. That is all I can say on the matter.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As the Department of Justice budget was ring-fenced for  this year, there was not much engagement with that Department on the June  monitoring round. Under the ring-fencing arrangement, the Department of Justice  is allowed to keep and reallocate any reduced requirements it may have. All it  has to do is simply notify us of that. As a result, I have had no detailed  discussions about the spending that there has been on hearing loss claims this  year. Therefore, I cannot confirm the figures that the Member raised. However,  as he has raised the issue, I will speak to the Justice Minister about that and  write to the Member.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  In his statement, the Minister spoke about banking. How likely does he think it  is that the Irish Government will default as regards the Anglo Irish Bank and  have to go to the IMF? If that happens, what would be the knock-on effect for  us?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I am not going to speculate on what may happen to  the finances of a foreign jurisdiction. However, from the conversations that I  have had with the Finance Minister in the Republic, I know that every attempt  had been made to safeguard against the kind of event that the Member described.  Obviously, given the fact that a lot of banking in Northern Ireland rests on  the activities of banks based not in the UK but in the Irish Republic &mdash; a point  that we made to the Treasury in London &mdash; any disturbance in its banking system  is bound to have a disproportionate impact on Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  The Minister mentioned the prioritisation of spending plans to ensure that  limited resources are put to the best possible use and the need for strategic  thinking. As the Minister knows, times are very tight, especially in  constituencies where a high number of people are or were employed in the construction  industry.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I ask the Member to come to his question.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Sure. What measures are being taken across Departments to ensure that  expenditure for capital schemes is made available quickly and efficiently to  ensure that people are at least maintained in jobs with companies in the  construction sector? I profess, at this stage, both a constituency sectional  interest and a regional interest.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  I ask the Member to bring his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Will the Minister give me some detail about the police training college at  Cookstown?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: The Member has certainly got a press statement for  the local paper. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span> I suppose that that is  the main point of his question. You have indulged him, Mr Speaker.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Executive will be responsible for &pound;1&middot;7 billion of  capital spend this year. Not all of that, of course, will go to the  construction industry. However, it is a very high level of capital spend and  one that is unlikely to be replicated in future years. As for getting schemes  on the ground quickly, we have tried to improve the whole procurement process  by ensuring that it is streamlined and that contracts get out. My DOE  colleague, Mr Poots, has, through the planning reform proposals, also sought to  improve the planning process to ensure that there are no hold-ups.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Through improving the whole procurement process, we seek to  ensure that schemes are not delayed by judicial reviews brought by people who  did not win tenders. I have said the following before, and, indeed, I say it  every time I meet employers and other people who are involved in the  construction industry, but I need to emphasise it. It is one thing for us to  change our processes here, and we should. We should look at our processes  continually to ensure that they are not slow, cumbersome or causing delay.  However, even when we do that, some people who did not get contracts enter into  lengthy judicial reviews simply because they did not like the result of the  procurement process. That, in turn, holds up projects. Both sides &mdash; the  construction industry and us &mdash; have a responsibility to ensure that that does  not happen.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The police training college is still part of the Department  of Justice&rsquo;s capital proposals. However, there will be other demands on the  capital budget, such as prisons. It is up to the Minister of Justice to decide  which of those will be his priority in constrained capital circumstances.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  That ends questions on the Minister of Finance and Personnel&rsquo;s statement. I am  sorry: Anno Lo is next. I apologise to the House.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: In  many ways, Mr McGlone asked my question. I am disappointed that the Department  for Social Development&rsquo;s bid for the social housing development programme did  not get any money, as that would certainly have helped the construction  industry. What plans does the Minister have to help that industry through  providing public spending for schools maintenance, the Egan contracts and so  on?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: We can allocate money only if it is available for  allocation. As I pointed out in my statement, the amount of reduced  requirements in the capital budget, which was approximately &pound;18 million, meant  that there was not a lot of money for reallocation. I must point out, however,  that the social housing budget has been very well provided for by this  Executive. Indeed, last year, we had a record social housing build of 1,800  units. I have no doubt that the former Minister for Social Development will  take some credit for that. The fact that we have had a record build in recent  years is an indication of the priority that has been given to the social  housing programme.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are other massive demands, but the Department for  Social Development has not done too badly in the current monitoring rounds. In  June, &pound;10 million was allocated for urban regeneration projects, which will, of  course, help the construction industry and help to kick-start economic  development in lots of towns around Northern Ireland. Therefore, I think that  the Minister for Social Development probably cannot complain. In fact, other  Ministers have had more cause for complaint and have complained much more  vociferously because they have not had any bids met in the two monitoring  rounds so far.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  That finally ends questions on the Minister of Finance and Personnel&rsquo;s  statement. Once again, I apologise to the Member.</p>
    <p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="d"></a>Personal Statement</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety has sought leave to  make a personal statement. Before calling the Minister, I remind the House that  a personal statement should be heard in silence. It is not a debate, and  questions cannot be asked about it. I also advise the House, as I did this  morning, that I will not be taking any points of order on any matter following  the statement. I hope that is clear to all Members.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Mr McGimpsey)</strong>: Thank you for  giving me the opportunity to make a personal statement to the House. I very much  wanted to make the statement yesterday, but I was awaiting legal advice around  some of the complex issues involved in this tragic case. On 21 September, I  answered a question for urgent oral answer in relation to the McDermott  brothers. In response to a supplementary question from Mrs Foster, I said:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;As I understand it, the doctor to whom Mrs Foster  refers was not an employee of the trust.&rdquo; &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Official Report, Vol 55, No 4, p182, col 2]</span>.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I subsequently learned that the doctor was employed  by the trust. That error was a genuine mistake for which I take full  responsibility, and I wish to apologise to you, Mr Speaker, and to the House.</p>

    <p class="H4StageHeading">Equality and Good Relations</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour and 30 minutes for  the debate. The proposer will have 10 minutes to propose the motion and 10  minutes to make a winding-up speech. One amendment has been selected and  published on the Marshalled List. The proposer of the amendment will have 10  minutes to propose and five minutes to make a winding-up speech. All other  Members who wish to speak will have five minutes.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly acknowledges that there will be no good  relations on this island without equality, and no equality without good  relations; recognises that people who are socially disadvantaged suffer most  from sectarian division; affirms the need for strong political leadership and  independent voices to challenge government to progress lasting change; believes  that government must tackle the origins and manifestations of sectarianism and  racism through a robust Executive strategy; notes the publication of the  programme for cohesion, sharing and integration; and believes that the  consultation document fails to provide an adequate framework to enable progress  towards a shared and reconciled society.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I thank my SDLP colleagues for tabling this motion,  and, in particular, I thank Conall McDevitt, who leads our policy work stream  in the area of building a shared future.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">After three years of waiting for the Office of the First  Minister and deputy First Minister to produce anything at all, I saw the first  draft of the proposed cohesion, sharing and integration strategy, and I must  say that I was deeply disappointed. The first draft, which was circulated some  months ago, remains one of the worst documents that I have ever read. It did  not mention a shared future or how we could progress towards one. It said  little or nothing about the way in which we educate our children, the way in  which we live in segregated communities and how evidence shows that, if you  live in a single identity community, you are much more likely to be poor,  unemployed, suffer ill health and early death. It did not even mention the only  state agency that openly pursues a shared future agenda: the Community  Relations Council. Instead, the OFMDFM paper focused primarily on the need to  correct bad behaviour, as if a shared future might somehow be achieved  automatically if people desisted from certain behaviours. The paper&rsquo;s language  and drafting were appalling. I am sure that it was not the handiwork of skilled  civil servants; it resembled something from a George Orwell novel. It was as  though the text had been produced by robots, devoid of empathy and intuition.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">11.45 am</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although the next draft, which was pushed quickly through  the Executive and is out for consultation, was slightly better, the central  problem persists: it is a strategy for sharing that says nothing meaningful  about sharing. The OFMDFM cohesion, sharing and integration strategy envisions  a future in which there are still two separate communities. The height of its  ambition is to have two communities that are still separate and unreconciled  but are, generally, at peace and not attacking or abusing each other. That is  what it means by &ldquo;good relations&rdquo;. To my party, that represents poverty of  ambition.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although improved community relations are a prerequisite  for building a shared society, they cannot be the end point. The Assembly must  simply aim higher. It must set itself the goal of creating one reconciled,  shared society that is completely comfortable with difference. Essentially, a  normal society is one in which no one is in the least bit bothered which church  their next-door neighbours attend or which party they vote for. Why can the  Assembly not show that a normal society is its ambition? Why does the OFMDFM  strategy fall short of that higher standard? Why is the CSI strategy so  mealy-mouthed on reconciliation and sharing?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When one thinks about it, the answer is obvious, albeit  disappointing. The truth is that the authors of the draft shared future  strategy &mdash; the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in &mdash; do not actually believe in sharing. They  honestly do not want a shared future. They prefer the traditional division that  affords them power in their single-identity communities: power and control  before all else and carve-up before sharing. Therefore, the task that they set  themselves was beyond what they are capable of achieving. That is why it took  three years to produce the draft CSI document. That is why the current document  is simply inadequate and unfit for purpose. Yet, it is now being offered  cynically to the public for comment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Even as it stands, it is clear that OFMDFM Ministers have  little confidence in what they have produced. They organised public  consultation meetings, but they left it to their officials to meet the public.  The two First Ministers and even the two junior Ministers were too busy to  stand in front of people to answer questions and explain themselves.  Incidentally, I have been told that there is a suggestion that the strategy has  the support of all parties in the Executive. That is not true. I will examine  the records of those meetings closely.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">So far, polite society has been, well, quite polite about  the new cohesion, sharing and integration strategy. People who have been  engaged in the hard work of cross-community reconciliation and peace building  have welcomed the fact that the paper has finally been produced. However,  behind the scenes, I know that, in many cases, their blood is boiling. Their  hopes and expectations have been dashed by what they know to be a cynical  exercise by two cynical parties. They know that they are not being listened to.  In the document, they see spurious detail about possible management structures  and who would be in control of what. Alongside that, they see the document&rsquo;s  utter absence of concrete proposals for building a better society.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Last year, when I held 14 public meetings to discuss how  the Department for Social Development could advance the shared future agenda &mdash;  14 public meetings, which, incidentally, I fronted &mdash; I came across many people  who longed for the normality of a genuinely shared society in this part of the  world. There is no doubt in my mind that the public whom we serve believe  overwhelmingly in a shared society, but they will not get that from this OFMDFM  strategy. The absence of real intent to deliver on the part of the DUP and Sinn  F&eacute;in serves only to conceal the real absence in all of this: the absence of  leadership.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although it is relatively easy for our joint First  Ministers to grit their teeth and stand together to condemn negative events,  such as dissident violence or racist attacks, where are the examples of  positive leadership? Where is the reaching out across the divide? [Laughter.]  Well may some of you laugh. When does it ever get past, &ldquo;You get that for your  side, and we will get that for our side&rdquo;?</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Last week, we saw the worst of that mentality when no one  at OFMDFM picked up the invitation to participate in the papal visit to the  United Kingdom. I said little at the time, because the Pope&rsquo;s visit was  continuing, but I thought that it was disgraceful. Suffice it to say that it is  a measure of the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s closed minds that we have one Minister who  cannot risk being in the same room as the Pope, even at the invitation of the  Queen, and another who is afraid of being in the same room as the Queen. Nor  did they pass on the invitation so that our devolved Administration could be represented,  for, in the carve-up world of OFMDFM, they alone are the Government.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We will not heal the deep divisions in this community if we  do not get leadership from those who have the most power. Leadership starts by  recognising that there is no credible alternative to a shared future. The  maintenance of two better regulated but still deeply divided communities cannot  be the answer. OFMDFM will have the opportunity to rewrite the cohesion,  sharing and integration strategy after this phase of consultation. They know  that it needs to be completely rewritten and to be supported by resources and a  timetable for action. Despite the flawed process, the SDLP will submit a  detailed and purposeful paper, which will help get the initiative back on  track. This is an opportunity for all of us to move on and to lead and reach  for the next horizon. I commend the motion to the House and pledge the best  efforts of my party in this vital work.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  As this is the first occasion on which the Assembly will hear from Mr Lyttle, I  remind the House that it is the convention that a maiden speech is made without  interruption.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Lyttle</strong>: I  beg to move the following amendment: At end insert</p>
    <p class="BillAmend-AmendedText">&ldquo;; and calls on the Executive to ensure that a  revised programme includes a clearly articulated vision of a cohesive, shared  and integrated society and an action plan covering policies, resource allocations,  targets, timetables and evaluation criteria.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">May I take this opportunity to thank you, Mr Speaker, and  your colleagues for the warm welcome to the Assembly that I have been given and  to put on record the honour and privilege that it is to be appointed to  represent the people of East Belfast in the House? I am immensely proud of the  constituency that I have lived in all my life. East Belfast is not only the  seat of our Assembly but is widely recognised for its rich industrial, cultural  and sporting heritage. Names such as Harland and Wolff, C S Lewis, Van Morrison  and George Best are world renowned, and, although some traditional industry in  the area has declined, I believe that the enterprise, creativity and  imagination of our people remain our most important resource in tackling social  disadvantage and promoting economic development in this region.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am aware that I follow in the line of distinguished  parliamentarians who have represented the constituency with exceptional ability  and, at times, no small measure of the feistiness and wit that are required to  survive in this arena. I am sure that the House will agree that those qualities  apply to no one more than my predecessor, Naomi Long, and will join me in  paying tribute to the tremendous record of leadership that she had in the  House. Naomi has been an outstanding Member of the Assembly and will continue  to be a formidable representative for this region in her role as Member of  Parliament for East Belfast. As deputy leader of the Alliance Party and as a  former Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for the Office of the First Minister  and deputy First Minister, Naomi has been the strongest advocate of the need  for a serious and overarching good relations policy to underpin the work of  every Department and to drive forward the work of the Executive. It is leaders  such as Naomi and people in organisations such as the Alliance Party, who prioritised  tackling the deep division in our community and believe that there is more to  unite us than divide us, who inspired me to take my own stand for a shared and  better future on behalf of my community. It is pertinent, therefore, that my  maiden contribution in the House is to move the amendment to the motion on  equality and good relations.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Alliance Party welcomes the historic opportunity  represented by the publication of the draft programme for cohesion, sharing and  integration, and it welcomes the debate on that important matter today.  Although my party will support the motion as tabled, I seek the support of the  House for our sensible amendment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want to make it clear from the outset that the challenge  of delivering equality and good relations in Northern Ireland must be much more  important than any one party political agenda. That being the case, the  Alliance Party recognises the progress that has been made by local politicians  in taking ownership of the draft strategy and the public consultation process  associated with it. However, we must also recognise the fact that the current  proposal is inadequate in some aspects and could be significantly improved. Our  amendment sets out the nature of those inadequacies in broad terms and  encourages OFMDFM and the wider Executive to address them in detail when the  new programme is finalised.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Alliance Party believes that the healing of deep  divisions in this society is the greatest challenge for the Assembly. It has a  vision of a cohesive, shared and integrated society, where people are safe and  prosperous, have ample opportunities and are treated fairly and respectfully.  We want to deliver a normal civic society underpinned by our shared values of  equality, respect for diversity and interdependence. The critical measure for  the programme must be what it will do for community relations in Northern  Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have spent approximately &pound;1.5 billion on peace building  in Northern Ireland, but that model is coming to an end. We need to take  responsibility for the ongoing human and economic cost of getting this issue  wrong. At a time of immense financial pressure, the fundamental link between a  shared society and economic development should be a major driver of change.  With approximately 70,000 spare school places and a crumbling schools estate,  it is vital that robust education reform proposals are included in the policy.  The establishment of a single integrated system that is shared by all children  must be a priority. For good reasons, people in contested places are cautious  about the education of their children. However, the delivery mechanisms that  reflect historic interests cannot be the driver for our children&rsquo;s education in  twenty-first-century Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We must also not make the mistake of regarding community  relations work solely as individually funded projects but see it rather as an  ethos that runs throughout our system of government. However, I take this  opportunity to pay tribute to the excellent strategic work of the Community  Relations Council and to the many men, women and children who make their own  significant contribution to improving community relations across our community,  often in the most difficult conditions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I mentioned previously, past initiatives of that type  occurred under direct rule, including, most recently, the shared future  strategy in 2005. Although there was little wrong with that strategy, I am sure  that the House will agree that it is much more desirable that local political  institutions take ownership of the development and delivery of future  strategies. The Alliance Party was, therefore, pleased to play a part in the  agreement of a draft policy this year. However, it is worth recognising the  fact that the current draft is an ongoing work and that significant concerns  have been raised about its current content. The consultation exercise is,  therefore, critical, and I was encouraged by the First Minister&rsquo;s remarks yesterday  during Question Time, when he reflected on OFMDFM&rsquo;s record of responding  positively to consultation recommendations. It is incumbent on OFMDFM and the  Executive to take on board what is received and to amend the programme  accordingly &mdash; indeed, to amend it radically.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">12.00 noon</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is good to have a Government document that tackles  issues such as shared space, shared education, shared housing, visible  manifestations of racism, sectarianism, bonfires, flags, the cost of duplicated  services and zero tolerance of hate crimes, and many of the key themes for  actions are also in there. In that respect, the glass is half full. However,  the vision of the document is weak and less developed. It is entitled cohesion,  sharing and integration (CSI), but at no stage are any of those concepts well  defined. Specifically, there is no affirmation of a shared society, and the  underlying assumption of managing a divided society and separate communities  remains. We are, therefore, in danger of having a shared-out future rather than  the shared future that this region needs and deserves.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Cohesion, in particular, is the new standard in the field  of community relations, and some very relevant work on it has been carried out  in Great Britain. However, there is very little reference in the document to  developing good practice beyond our shores. The Alliance Party is also wary of  a hierarchy between equality and good relations. The document must recognise  that there can be no sustainable equality in the region without a sense of  solidarity, interdependence and sharing. Equality arguments should not be used  to undermine good relations, and vice versa. We also regret that there is not  sufficient recognition of the economic and financial costs of continued  divisions and of the opportunities that would come from a shared society. That  is critical to understanding the full structural problems faced in the economy  and to appreciating what will provide a real motivating force for devising a  strong CSI strategy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We need a clear vision of cohesion, sharing and integration  and a detailed action plan against which to resource, target, timetable,  monitor, evaluate and deliver that programme. The CSI programme must not be  considered as just another document but a historic opportunity to make reconciliation,  equality and good relations a reality for this and future generations of our  community. Tremendous progress has occurred in the peace process over the past  15 years, including during this Assembly mandate. In order to realise our full  potential, however, the political process must articulate a clear vision of a  shared society and devise a robust action plan to address the ongoing human and  financial cost of prejudice and segregation to our community.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Spratt</strong>:  Equality and good relations are a key component of any modern society;  therefore I am pleased to speak in the debate.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">For far too long, sectarianism and division have been a  hallmark of life in Northern Ireland, and I welcome the First Minister and the  deputy First Minister&rsquo;s considerable efforts to reduce and eradicate that  cancer from our society. There has been much criticism of the cohesion, sharing  and integration document: that it took too long to produce and that it lacks  detail on timescales, actions and targets. However, this is a massive and  important task, and it is critical to get it right. As Members are aware, the  consultation process provided an opportunity to identify and address any issues  that have not been included. The CSI document should be seen as the beginning  of a very substantial process.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I said before, Northern Ireland has been riven with  sectarian divisions for far too long; it is a way of life for some people in  the Province, and it will take a long time to change attitudes. That can be  achieved only through a number of initiatives. However, I do not want to give  the impression that work has not already been done to tackle those issues. Many  organisations and, indeed, individuals have worked tirelessly over the years to  create a better future for everyone, and that must be commended. However, much  of that work has been done at the coalface. The CSI strategy is a political  agreement at a high strategic level, and it must be said that this is the first  time that that has been achieved in the Assembly. That is clearly a major  development, and it should be recognised as such.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As the deputy First Minister said, the clear intention is  to set targets and actions to take forward the strategy and make a real  difference. Those targets will be monitored and ensured by the ministerial  panel, and they should be fully integrated with the Programme for Government  and the public service agreements (PSAs). There is no doubt that the First  Minister and deputy First Minister intend to follow through on their pledge to  tackle the deep divisions in our society. The fact that there has been a  consultation process and that there will be input from all Departments ensures  that all interested parties have an opportunity to contribute to that vital and  strategic policy document.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is also important to note that the document does not  simply focus on tackling sectarianism and racism but affirms that all forms of  intolerance, including hate crimes, antisocial behaviour, harassment,  discrimination, recreational rioting and interface issues are to be recognised  as unacceptable in our society. That also includes attacks on people on any  basis, such as age, disability, race, sexual orientation or gender. In respect  of good relations, the First Minister stated:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;There can be no room for sectarianism, racism or any  form of hate crime. Attacks or violence that are motivated by any of those are  unacceptable and must be condemned. &hellip; It is not only words of condemnation that  are required but an identification of the causes of bad relations and actions  to tackle the problem.&rdquo; &mdash; [Official Report, Vol 46, No 1, p23, col 2].</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The concept of good relations has been in the mix for some  time. OFMDFM has already provided major funding and worked with local councils  and the Community Relations Council to achieve good relations. As I said, much  has already been done to change attitudes. However, with the backing of the  First and deputy First Ministers, we will have in place a high-level strategic  plan that will have a long-term impact. If we are to develop the economy and attract  investment from overseas, we must not allow the scenes of recreational rioting  and interface tensions that made the headlines in July this year. All crimes  and violence that are motivated by hate and intolerance must be challenged.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not agree, however, with the motion&rsquo;s last statement:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;the consultation document fails to provide an  adequate framework to enable progress towards a shared and reconciled society.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member should bring his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Spratt</strong>:  Therefore, we cannot support the motion that is before the House today.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms M Anderson</strong>:  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat. The motion and the amendment betray a lack of  understanding of the equality provisions in section 75(1) of the 1998 Act. For  that reason, we will reject the motion and the amendment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion clearly suggests that equality and good  relations are coequal sides of one coin; that they are both as important as  each other. That is simply not the case, because good relations can be built  only upon equality. Equality cannot and should not be built upon good  relations. Shame on Margaret Ritchie, the leader of the SDLP, for driving such  an agenda.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Let us take housing as an example. If we were to work on  the basis of objective need, it might be shown, for instance, that more  Catholics are on the waiting list and need allocated housing or that more  Protestants are on the waiting list and need allocated housing. However, some  people could object to having Catholics or Protestants living nearby because it  would have a detrimental impact on good relations. The SDLP&rsquo;s motion promotes  the idea of equal status for equality and good relations. Is the SDLP saying  that, were that to be the case, housing for Catholics or for Protestants could  be blocked on that basis? Where would that have left the Gildernews?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  If we are going to have a debate, it is important that we understand the  difference between equality and equity. Ms Anderson seems to have forgotten the  basic lesson of the schoolmistress who invites her children to take off a shoe  and throw it into the middle of the room and then invites the children to  blindfold themselves and pick up a shoe, and they do. They sit down, and the  schoolmistress asks the children whether they are happy. They say, &ldquo;No; not  particularly. We are not happy.&rdquo; She asks, &ldquo;Oh, why are you not happy?&rdquo; and  they say, &ldquo;Because we have all ended up with each other&rsquo;s shoes&rdquo;. The  schoolmistress says, &ldquo;But I did things equally. I treated you all equally. You  all had the opportunity to pick up a shoe, and you now have a shoe&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The problem is, as with Ms Anderson&rsquo;s analysis &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  As with Ms Anderson&rsquo;s analysis, that does not consider the fundamental issue,  which is that you cannot decide equality until you understand need, and until  you understand need, you do not get equality, and that is why good relations  are so important.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. It is good practice that interventions should be short and to the point. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span> That is good practice not only in this  House but elsewhere. The Member has a minute added to her time.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms M Anderson</strong>:  I should have an extra two or three minutes. I appreciate that Conall McDevitt  is a new MLA, and perhaps he does not understand section 75(1) and section  75(2) of the 1998 Act. The thinking and intention behind section 75(1) was that  equality should always, absolutely always, take priority. Good relations &mdash;  section 75(2) &mdash; will flow from that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Equality is necessary; good relations are desirable.  Equality is the primary duty, and I find it disappointing, but absolutely not  surprising, that the SDLP do not seem to recognise that. What else would we  expect from a party that opposed the MacBride principles? Perhaps the proposers  of the motion, one of whom is the leader of the SDLP, are once again seeking to  remove what their previous leader once referred to as the ugly scaffolding of  the Good Friday Agreement &mdash; that same ugly scaffolding that exists to safeguard  the rights and entitlements of nationalists.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Those protections were hard won. They were hard won &mdash;<span class="Italic"> [Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms M Anderson</strong>:  They were hard won.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. Allow the Member to continue.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms M Anderson</strong>:  They were hard won, and nationalists and republicans can take heart that Sinn  F&eacute;in, and Sinn F&eacute;in representatives, have absolutely no intention of  surrendering them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the fact that the cohesion, sharing and  integration strategy document has been published for consultation, a  consultation that provides us all with an opportunity to strengthen the  strategy. The cohesion, sharing and integration strategy is a cross-cutting  policy, and, as such, it needs to be driven at the highest level of leadership.  As an indication of intent, the cohesion, sharing and integration document  proposes a panel led by our First Minister and deputy First Minister that will  work with a reinvigorated racial equality forum and other stakeholder groups,  communities, and communities of interest.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The consultation document should be critically appraised.  That is to be welcomed. The junior Minister in the Chamber yesterday talked  about how he attended meetings, and there definitely were such critical  appraisals. I welcome the fact that for the first time the dialogue to  facilitate the development of cohesion, sharing and integration in this society  is, if the SDLP will read it at paragraph 1.6 of the consultation document,  framed in the context of:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;equality and the enforcement of rights.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">However, Sinn F&eacute;in has been clear from the day that  the draft cohesion, sharing and integration strategy document was published  that it was not the final article, and we heard the First Minister make such a  reference yesterday.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We all have an opportunity to shape the final strategy &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member should draw her remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms M Anderson</strong>:  For all the reasons that I outlined, we will not be supporting the motion or  the amendment.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member&rsquo;s time is up.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms M Anderson</strong>:  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  I congratulate Chris Lyttle on his maiden speech. I thank the Members for  tabling this motion. I have got myself in a muddle; bear with me. The Ulster  Unionist Party will work constructively &mdash; bear with me just a second; I had  shuffled my documents. Thank you for bearing with me.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">12.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I thank the Members who tabled the motion for doing so.  Northern Ireland&rsquo;s recent history has been turbulent and violent. That has left  us with a legacy of segregation, mistrust and, in some cases, open hostility.  The Belfast Agreement brought us peace and created political institutions that  have largely served to regulate our differences.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, we have not taken the necessary steps to move  towards a society that is genuinely pluralist, genuinely integrationist and  genuinely built on respect for our different traditions. That is evidenced by  the fact that we have more peace lines today than we did in 1998. More people  live in segregated communities, and there is growing violence from dissident  republicans. That is despite us having probably the most stringent equality  regime in Europe.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Ulster Unionist Party believes in a genuinely pluralist  Northern Ireland. We believe in a genuinely tolerant United Kingdom, and we  believe in building genuine respect and integration between all groups in our  society. So, it is clear that we have a job of work to do. However, we must be  aware of what is at stake.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We cannot allow our children and young people to repeat a  history of segregation and intolerance. The motion is also right to point out  that in areas of social deprivation, segregation is at its most acute. If we  fail to get this right, we will be dooming not only those communities but  potentially our entire community. Would any international investors have been  inspired to invest by the scenes in the Ardoyne in July? It is that reality  that makes the document produced by Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP so disappointing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The delay in the production of the cohesion, sharing and  integration strategy appears to be due to differences between building good  relations and equality. It has long been a position of Sinn F&eacute;in to diminish  emphasis on good relations in favour of an ideological, divisive and exclusive  focus on the equality agenda. The cohesion, sharing and integration document  does not provide any solutions to that dilemma. Instead, it promotes the  separate but equal agenda. That creates a danger of furthering a factory of  grievances approach. The culmination of that approach in the document is the  potential abolition of the Community Relations Council (CRC), if two of the  four options available are chosen. Whatever the CRC&rsquo;s flaws, it has provided an  independent voice on an issue that some politicians have often sought to avoid.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The draft cohesion, sharing and integration strategy lacks  goals beyond the general; it has no specific action plans and offers very  little on young people, housing and education. Action in those areas is crucial  if we are to avoid repeating ourselves. The document is more about sharing out  than a shared future, and I am concerned that it will lead to a Balkanisation  agenda being pursued without criticism and scrutiny. It also does not do enough  to integrate other minorities in Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Reflecting on that, some of the language in the SDLP&rsquo;s  motion is unhelpful. The SDLP appears to be riding two horses at once. Of  course we all want a more equal society, but we do not want a &ldquo;one for you and  one for me&rdquo; mentality to pervade in the cohesion, sharing and integration  strategy. That is especially true as we enter a period of much-reduced funding.  The logical conclusion of the opening sentence of the SDLP&rsquo;s motion is  paralysis and a stand-off.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Ulster Unionist Party will work constructively with and  for any legitimate group in Northern Ireland, and we will pursue a shared  future that is not based on gimmicks &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Will the Member bring his remarks to a close?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  We will do that because we want a better Northern Ireland and because we are &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  No. We will do that because we are unapologetic unionists who want a strong and  positive union, and we will do that because it is right.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Robinson</strong>:  Equality and good relations must be one of the most difficult topics in  Northern Ireland, but nobody should have any doubt that my party and I are  committed to equality and good relations for all in Northern Ireland. On 3  September 2010, the First Minister said:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;We are at the beginning of a very important process  and we want to hear the views of people throughout our society on how we can  build a better future for everyone.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That is a clear indication of my party&rsquo;s thinking on the  way forward. It is also a clear statement of the support that this side of the  House has for the principle of equality for everyone. Everyone will be treated  equally in the Northern Ireland that is being built.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is sadly true that those who suffer most from inequality  are those who are at the greatest disadvantage for whatever reason &mdash;  disability, unemployment or race. The Assembly must ensure that inequality is  not common in society. I am also convinced that strong political leadership has  been shown. The fact that the Assembly has not collapsed over the past three  and a half years proves that strong leadership has been given, especially by  the First Minister and his predecessor, Lord Bannside. That is reflected in the  programme for cohesion, sharing and integration.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As elected representatives, we must all lead by example,  particularly when making statements to the press and in public places, so that  we do not inflame situations, such as occurred recently in Coleraine. If we are  to build a society equal for all, we must choose our words very carefully. It  is most regrettable that Members who signed the motion did not reflect on the  early stage that the consultation process is at. The motion does little to  promote cohesion, sharing or integration; it does the opposite.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Northern Ireland needs a peaceful future, and the programme  for cohesion, sharing and integration is an important milestone in achieving  that. If the party that supports the motion wants that state of affairs, it  should not put further divisive motions before the Assembly but work positively  to achieve the equality that it says it wants.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McKay</strong>: I  oppose the motion and the amendment, as my party colleague outlined.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Fundamentally, equality cannot and should not be built on  good relations. The CSI document highlights that equality is the foundation of  good relations and that good relations can only be built on equality.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 places a duty  on public authorities to treat people equally, regardless of race, age, marital  status, religious belief, political opinion, or sexual orientation. By making  the maintenance of good relations a duty equal to equality, many progressive  policies to tackle inequality would be vetoed. That would be bad for good  relations, or so some politicians in our community would argue.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  am grateful to the Member for giving way and I promise not to mention shoes. <span class="Italic">[Laughter.]</span></p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I ask the Member to consider that the problem that Sinn  F&eacute;in articulates with regard to the relationship between equality and good  relations is actually a misunderstanding of the concept of good relations,  which has been used and abused by certain politicians. If we talk about good  relations in a context of sharing, it implies respect for diversity, which does  not threaten equality; whereas, if someone objects to something and employs a  &ldquo;good relations&rdquo; argument against it, it represents a warping of the notion of  a shared society and the idea of good relations.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Member may have an extra minute to speak.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McKay</strong>: I  thank the Member for his intervention, but different parties have different  interpretations of &ldquo;good relations&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">For example, members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and  transgender (LGBT) community could apply to their local council for funding for  a gay pride parade or a public event, and local councillors could employ the  argument that funding or holding such an event in their community or in a  particular area would be bad for good relations in that area. Councillors would  be wrong to employ that argument, but some would. That could &mdash; would &mdash; happen,  given the views of some political parties.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  That is exactly the point that I was trying to make; it is a clear example of a  misunderstanding of the concept of good relations in a shared society; it is an  abuse of the concept. That should not happen.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McKay</strong>:  Equality should be safeguarded at all times; it has to be the cornerstone of  society and must be ahead of good relations. That is why in this case &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  Will the Member give way again?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McKay</strong>:  No. Two interventions are enough, Basil.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We will not support that; we will not support the  undermining of equality safeguards in society, and we will not support the  dilution of the equality legislation secured in the Good Friday Agreement.  Equality is the bottom line as far as Sinn F&eacute;in is concerned. Sectarianism and  intolerance are still rife in this society, and we must ensure that an  effective strategy is in place, and that funding is used effectively to tackle  those problems.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The concept of good relations taking priority over equality  has led to the consolidation and ingraining of inequality in some cases and has  been used by those opposed to the equality agenda to undermine hard-fought  equality measures. Some of the aims and objectives outlined are to be welcomed,  as the Member for East Belfast Chris Lyttle said earlier. Those include zero tolerance  on crimes motivated by prejudice and all forms of hate crime; working to  eliminate attacks on cultural, sports and other symbolic property and  monuments, including GAA halls and Orange Halls in our community; maximising  the impact of funding on the ground; and encouraging shared neighbourhoods and  eliminating segregated services. That is worth working towards.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The CSI document could be better. One of the parties  involved in the Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister is  progressive and the other is not. Sinn F&eacute;in not only wants to see the LGBT  sector &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  Who is progressive and who is not?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McKay</strong>: It  does not take a genius, Alban.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McKay</strong>:  Sinn F&eacute;in not only wants to see the LGBT sector fully involved in this process,  but wants to see their concerns dealt with effectively.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  Why do you not include them in &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McKay</strong>:  The CSI strategy will not resolve sectarianism and the prejudicial attitudes  that exist in this society. One hears a lot of comments from the SDLP about the  document, and it is critical of what has been put together so far. However,  that is only the first step in the process. It is worth remembering that the  SDLP had ample opportunity to put together such a document when it was in the  same office with the Ulster Unionist Party. It did not achieve anything. We got  nothing from the SDLP. It is all very well for the party to come here and try  to criticise us for what has been brought forward, but it has not been able to  do any of that work itself. Shame on the SDLP for bringing the motion forward,  and shame on the SDLP for trying to undermine the equality legislation that was  secured after decades of hard work. It does not understand the impact of what  it is putting forward &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  After decades of violence &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order, order.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McKay</strong>:  The SDLP should go back to the &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  Order. Allow the Member to finish.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McKay</strong>:  They should try to understand the impact of what they are proposing. Go raibh  maith agat.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Speaker</strong>:  The Business Committee has arranged to meet immediately during the lunchtime  suspension today. I propose, therefore, by leave of the Assembly, to suspend  the sitting until 2.00 pm. The first Member to speak after lunchtime will be Mr  Allan Bresland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">The sitting was suspended at 12.28 pm.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">On resuming (Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr Dallat] in the  Chair) &mdash;</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bresland</strong>:  I want a Northern Ireland that is free from sectarian and racial hatred, where  all are equal under the law and where people live together in harmony. Sadly,  despite the improved times in which we live, tensions still exist across  society and are often just beneath the surface.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The programme for cohesion, sharing and integration is out for  consultation. It is a genuine effort to bring about the sort of changes that we  need. I regret that the SDLP has felt it necessary to throw a spanner in the  works by proposing this divisive motion.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I believe in civil and religious liberty for all, and I try  to be a good neighbour to all. However, I am not convinced that those who  tabled the motion share my commitment to those principles. Indeed, the SDLP&rsquo;s  track record points in the opposite direction. The SDLP is good at talking the  talk, but it is not so good at walking the walk. It is the party that joined  Sinn F&eacute;in, the Alliance Party and the Green Party last October to demand that  an Executive Minister sacrifice his right to religious conscience. It is the  party that supported 50:50 recruitment to the PSNI, thus denying equality of  opportunity to many capable young Protestants. It is the party that attacked my  colleague Lord Bannside for exercising his right to protest against the papal  visit in Scotland. It is the party that wants to deny Protestants the right to  exercise civil and religious liberty on the streets of our Province. It is the  party that says that we must hold on to the Parades Commission, which is a body  that has a dreadful track record of bias against my community. I will take no  lectures from the SDLP on equality or good relations. Before it comes to the  House with its fine-sounding words, it really needs to put its house in order.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Like many people in Northern Ireland, I am concerned about  the growth of the equality industry. Surely no other region in Europe has the  same amount of equality legislation and number of quangos that we have in  Northern Ireland. That is hard to justify on the grounds of value for money.  More importantly, we have to ask whether the equality industry is actually  delivering. The people whom I represent do not feel that their rights are  protected.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I said, the programme for cohesion, sharing and  integration offers an opportunity for the way forward. It offers a way to  resolve some of the outstanding issues. Rather than attacking the CSI strategy,  let us use it as a platform to build on. I oppose the motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  I am grateful to Danny Kennedy, who has allowed me to say a few words. I want  to dispel any myths that are going around here. I am not used to speaking to  such a small audience; however, I will do my best.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I wanted to address my comments to friends and colleagues  and to esteemed Sinn F&eacute;in Assembly Members. I am looking for them, and, unless  Barry McElduff is hiding round there, I cannot see any of them. That just shows  how important this topic is to Sinn F&eacute;in. Nevertheless, I will address some of  the comments that Ms Anderson in particular made &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span> Hold on a tick. Here we go &mdash; reinforcements have arrived. For one minute, I  thought that I would have to talk to myself. It would not have been the first  time that I have done that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I would like to put forward some really important issues. I  listened intently to the speeches in the debate. I find it strange when people  say, as Sinn F&eacute;in tried to argue, that there must be equality above all else.  Surely, need must come into it. Surely, if someone is in dire straits and has  an absolutely obvious case for help, we should help them first, regardless of  whether they are Catholic or Protestant, white or black, from these shores or  not. Surely, the whole essence of civilization and having a responsible  attitude is to look after those who are in most need. I am not saying that  equality is not important: I am saying that it is just one of a collection of  needs that we have to try to address.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCallister</strong>:  I am grateful to the Member for making a contribution to such a small audience.  Does he agree that we focus on equality too much? We have some of the most  robust equality legislation and measures in the European Union, probably, yet  we also have one of the most divided societies in the European Union. We are  not going to achieve everything by equality alone.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr B McCrea</strong>:  The Member makes the useful point that we should be looking at outcomes. Can we  find a way of doing more than issuing just nice words? I heard Mr Spratt speak  most eloquently on the subject. The issue is highlighted by looking at the  official position, which concerns how we treat people, regardless of race,  background, sexual orientation or any other circumstance. Mr Spratt repeatedly  said that we have to address such issues, not just by word but by deed. We have  to show our society that we are prepared to work together, that there is a real  issue about leadership being shown by those of us in the Assembly and beyond.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I take this opportunity &mdash; I hope that I do not speak out of  turn with my party colleagues &mdash; to say that there has been a lot of discussion  of late in the press about various issues. Certainly, Tom Elliott and I have  discussed such matters, and I want to put it on the record that Tom works  extremely hard in his constituency to bring communities and people from all  backgrounds together. He really works at that, and anybody who tries to make  mischief out of such things completely misunderstands and misrepresents the  reality on the ground.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The issue that I have with the motion and the reason why I  stand before you is to say that I believe absolutely in a shared future because  I think that it will make all of us stronger. In another place, I argued that,  from my political perspective, the Union is stronger when it is a Union for  everybody. We should seek to bring people together in our tent to tell them  that their contribution is welcome.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Few people have a monopoly on the issue. It is not  something about which one party can say that it is the party of equality, of  equal opportunity or of this, that and the other. It is about collectivism, it  is something that we must do together because that makes us all stronger. We  all felt a little sympathy for Danny Kinahan during his speech because we have  all experienced not quite getting our papers together. However, Members who  listened to what he said heard a first-rate speech that all of us could  support. Given the opportunity, I advocate continually that we need to see  leadership from the Chamber &mdash; genuine leadership &mdash; and some form of generosity  of spirit. It is a mistake for people to sometimes try to make a party  political issue out of a matter that is all-embracing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Way before my time to speak is up, I will conclude by  saying that we will support the amendment and the motion, but we will do so on  the basis of the good intent that has been expressed by Members in the debate.  Perhaps, all of us could use language a little better; however, collectively,  we are the better for it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  Our party will support the Alliance Party amendment, which not only adds to the  motion but serves to highlight the deficiencies in the CSI strategy.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is most alarming that reconciliation is not mentioned  once in the strategy. It is even more alarming to hear Martina Anderson&rsquo;s  comments. I am glad that she has now joined us. Where in republicanism was  apartheid ever mentioned? They are trying to create a North that, according to  their ideal, is separate but equal. Perhaps that explains to some extent why  there are more peace walls throughout the North. Perhaps we should simply build  peace walls around all our towns and villages to segregate communities, because  that appears to be Martina Anderson and Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s vision.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms M Anderson</strong>:  Will the Member give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  Not just yet; I will give way later. I wish to address a few other points that  Ms Anderson made. She challenged the SDLP about what it has done. We have done  quite a lot. Where, in fact, were Martina and her comrades in the 1960s, 1970s  and 1980s, when the SDLP was arguing for a reconciled North of Ireland? Where  were they when we said that the only way to build equality and good relations  was through peaceful political dialogue and not through violence? We welcome  the fact that, in parts, Sinn F&eacute;in is on the same page as the SDLP today.  However, it has performed more U-turns than the Iron Lady. Sinn F&eacute;in has much  to explain to the nationalist community.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Sinn F&eacute;in also has much to explain to the section 75 groups  that are not mentioned in the strategy. Sinn F&eacute;in cannot have it both ways.  Either, as Robin Newton said yesterday, it is a strategy to deal with  sectarianism and racism, or it is not. When Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP produced the  document, they said that it related to all sections of society and would create  a better, fairer and more inclusive Northern Ireland. Yet, outside of their  contributions and proposals, young people are abysmally and appallingly dealt  with in the document. Victims are not mentioned at all. People who live in  marginalised areas and feel marginalised as members of society are not  represented. There is no mention of people with disabilities. The document  contains no response on gender identity and nothing for the LGBT sector.  Indeed, women are excluded entirely from the strategy. Therefore, it is rich of  Sinn F&eacute;in to point to section 75, when it is clear that it has no understanding  of what section 75 is about.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I listened to Daith&iacute; McKay, who comes from a constituency  that includes Rasharkin, which is hardly a prime example of how people can live  in a spirit of good relations and equality. It is win or lose, and, currently,  all the people of Rasharkin are losers, because their problems are not being  dealt with. We are not giving political leadership, and we are not building a  shared and reconciled society.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Good Friday Agreement was about reconciliation and  finding a better way forward. On behalf of the SDLP, I say that the cohesion,  sharing and integration strategy should have been about the solidarity that  must exist among all people who live here. We must have interdependence among  all people who live here, because, without going forward together, we will not  go forward at all. Therefore, the strategy must include everyone. As I  outlined, however, significant sections of our society are excluded entirely  from the cohesion, sharing and integration strategy. I remind Members that it  is almost a year since Sinn F&eacute;in produced its own version of the strategy  following its little spat with the DUP on the subject.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In tabling the motion, the SDLP is intent on building a  reconciled future. Margaret Ritchie, in her campaign for party leader, made it  one of her main commitments. She made it clear that it was one of the main  pillars on which she would base her efforts to take our party and the community  forward. No voices from the wider society are being heard, yet people who  attended the consultation meetings are champions of the cohesion, sharing and  integration strategy.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member should bring her remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  Sinn F&eacute;in should have listened to us a few months ago when it was making a mess  of the parades legislation. It should listen to us now and it would not have  orange egg all over its face again today.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister) (Mr Newton)</strong>:  I am grateful for the opportunity to respond to the debate. I thank the Members  who tabled the motion because it has given the Assembly an opportunity to  debate the content of the cohesion, sharing and integration consultation  document rather than some of the more spurious aspects of the issue that have  been thrown around the Chamber today.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will begin by quoting the document&rsquo;s opening paragraph:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;We have entered a new and hopeful period in our  history. Our vision for this new era is that, working together, we will build a  shared and better future for us all. We want to build a society where everyone  shares in and enjoys the benefits of a more peaceful society.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">It is a positive statement, which stands in stark  contrast to the extremely negative attitude that the SDLP has displayed. The  aim of the document, which is our aim, is a shared future: not separate, but  equal. The strategy makes clear our aim for shared spaces; shared celebration  of cultural expression; and shared neighbourhoods, workplaces and educational  opportunities. Executive agreement of the draft programme for cohesion, sharing  and integration should be seen as a significant moment in our ongoing effort to  build a shared and better future for all. I welcome the opportunity to  reiterate its importance and to call on the Assembly, as a whole, to give its  full support to the draft programme.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Dolores Kelly mentioned what I said in the House yesterday.  I must point out to the Member for Upper Bann that reconciliation is mentioned  in the document. I advise her to go away and read the document before she comes  to the Assembly to speak on it. I emphasise again what I said in the House  yesterday: the SDLP and, indeed, the Ulster Unionists, I am afraid to say,  failed to produce anything during their time in the posts of First Minister and  deputy First Minister. They could not get agreement, even on a high-level  policy, so it is striking to listen to the leader of the SDLP dismiss the  Executive consultation document with such disdain. Since she became an MP, she  has been taking lessons in how to be more insulting. That is the way in which  she came across. She was very professional in her insulting contribution. That  negative view exists only in the imagination of the SDLP and has no place in  this discourse.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs D Kelly</strong>:  Will the junior Minister give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Mr Newton)</strong>: I am sorry, but I have only 15 minutes, and I have to  get all my remarks made.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I said yesterday that I had attended several of the public  consultation events. Not only did I attend them, but I spoke to at least one  third of the audiences at each event before it began. I spoke to individuals,  table to table, about their concerns about the consultation document.  Therefore, I will not take any lessons on consultation from the SDLP.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to realise that the draft programme is  intended only to be a framework document for improved co-ordination of policy  across government and the community and voluntary sector. That will ultimately  ensure a more efficient, effective and focused response to the challenges of  sectarianism and racism. The draft programme for cohesion, sharing and  integration sets out a vision for a new era in which all of us can work  together to build a shared and better future, a future in which fairness,  equality, rights, responsibilities and respect are acknowledged and accepted by  all.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr A Maginness</strong>:  Will the junior Minister give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Mr Newton)</strong>: I have only 15 minutes. I agree with the Member for  East Belfast Mr Lyttle. It seems that, despite his little time in the Chamber,  he has a more thorough grasp of the document than the much more seasoned and  mature campaigners on the SDLP Benches, who should be able to analyse documents  and put forward arguments, not arguments that are somewhere out of the ether  but arguments that are focused on the document and the policy. That makes it  even sadder that the Alliance Party has tabled an amendment to the SDLP motion.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The strategy represents a high-level strategic direction,  and, once we get agreement on that framework and take into account what we hear  during the consultation &mdash; I expect to hear lots during the consultation &mdash; we  will seek final Executive agreement and start to work urgently to develop  detailed and robust actions in all the specified areas. Likewise, we recognise  all the valuable work and the critical role that is carried out in very  difficult times by the Community Relations Council. I challenge Ms Ritchie&rsquo;s  allegation that the Community Relations Council is absent from the strategy. In  fact, the CRC appears no fewer than 16 times throughout the document.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>: She  missed it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Mr Newton)</strong>: She missed it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Spratt</strong>:  Rose-tinted glasses.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Mr Newton)</strong>: Rose-tinted glasses. I welcome the recognition by my  colleagues Mr Spratt and George Robinson that the publication of the strategy  has been a significant and positive development in our efforts to tackle the  scourges of sectarianism and racism in our community.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: Will  the junior Minister give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Mr Newton)</strong>: I have already &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>:  Order. The Minister has made it consistently clear that he does not wish to  give way. Please respect that.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The junior  Minister (Mr Newton)</strong>: I speak to all Members of the House when I say that  intolerance, prejudice, division, separation, hate and violence cannot be  resolved by the publication of one document. This strategy represents a  high-level commitment, but everyone in the Chamber and the Assembly needs to  work together with the community groups and with each other to continue to  bring about real and positive changes on the ground. Indeed, that is  particularly true of the party leaders. Peter Robinson, DUP leader, made it  clear yesterday during Question Time that this document offers leadership to  the entire community. Taking the negative approach will do no one in the  community any good. Indeed, that attitude will create further divisions in the  community. I do not know what the SDLP&rsquo;s contribution will be to the  consultative process, but I urge it to make a positive rather than a negative  response. As Ms Anderson said, the draft programme acknowledges that good  relations cannot be built on inequality and that the promotion of equality of  opportunity is essential to build good relations.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome Mr Kinahan&rsquo;s contribution, and, for that reason,  I am disappointed to learn that the Ulster Unionists will support the SDLP  motion. I welcomed Mr Kinahan&rsquo;s contribution, which was to say that the Ulster  Unionist Party will work constructively to contribute to this process. It is  difficult to see how that party can support a motion with such negative content  given that, when Mr Kinahan was on his feet, he spoke very positively about  supporting the process. I agree with him: we must tackle the deprivation that  contributes to bad community relations. However, I reiterate to Mr Kinahan that  actions and targets must follow agreement on the overarching strategy. If we  are not able to reach and implement a strategy, there is not much sense in  having targets.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will respond to Basil McCrea&rsquo;s comments. The process has  been about trying to identify need and find the appropriate actions to address  the need. There is a need to urgently address sectarianism throughout the  community and to encourage greater sharing by tackling the barriers to that.  That includes not only physical barriers but those that exist in the mindsets  of people who would engage in hate crimes, sectarianism and racist activities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion affirms the need for strong political leadership  and for independent voices to challenge government to progress lasting change.  The draft CSI programme aims to do precisely that. It is a draft document and  is not cast in stone. The draft programme sets out plans for the establishment  of a ministerial panel, which will be chaired by OFMDFM Ministers and will  include all Ministers. Therefore the SDLP, the Ulster Unionist Party, the  Alliance Party, Sinn F&eacute;in and the DUP will all sit round the table. I assume  that they will make a positive contribution. There will be key decision-makers  from other statutory agencies and representatives of the community and  voluntary sector, and that mechanism will be driven by strong political  leadership to progress the work on what are complex and difficult issues and to  ensure that it remains at the top of everyone&rsquo;s agenda. Members will be aware  that we have increased funding for work to promote good relations and good  relations practice by one third for the period 2008 to 2011. Funding for youth  and interface workers has also increased by one quarter.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">CSI is a framework. Instead of criticising the draft  programme as a whole, I ask Members to see it as a foundation on which we can  build a new vision for a shared and better society here that is more cohesive  and in which we can respect and tolerate each other&rsquo;s cultural identity in a  context of fairness, equality, respect, rights and accepting our own  responsibilities.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: As Question Time commences at 2.30 pm, the House should take its  ease until that time. The debate will continue after Question Time, when Mr  Stephen Farry will make a winding-up speech on the amendment.</p>

    <p class="OralAnswers-H2DepartmentHeading">Social Development</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Affordable Housing: Strangford</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">1. <strong>Mr  McNarry </strong>asked the Minister for Social Development for an update on the  availability of land for affordable housing in the Strangford constituency,  particularly in the Comber area. &nbsp;(AQO  149/11<a name="AQO149/11" id="AQO149/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development &nbsp;(Mr Attwood)</strong>: I  thank the Member for his question. I can confirm that there are a number of  sites across the Strangford constituency, many of which the Member will be  aware. There are 33 new homes on a site at Dunsy Way, which is being taken  forward by the Fold Housing Association. A further site on the Newtownards Road  is being taken forward by Connswater Homes, which expects to start work on 12  new homes later this year. There are a range of other sites in the constituency  where housing associations have expressed an interest. The Housing Executive  and the Department are working with the housing associations to try to put  those new homes into future work programmes.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McNarry</strong>:  I thank the Minister for his helpful answer. He used the term &ldquo;expressed an  interest&rdquo;. What access are housing associations being given to secure land for  such projects, for example, land beside Upper Crescent in Comber, of which the  Minister should be aware as it is directly beside a recently completed  development?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I am not aware of that particular site, and I will come  back to the Member with the details. However, I can confirm that Connswater  Homes has an interest in building eight new homes in Londonderry Avenue, and  Trinity Housing plans to build 10 new homes on the Belfast Road. Obviously,  that is subject to all the necessary approvals and appraisals being completed.  All that complements the 50 new homes recently completed at Upper Crescent in  Comber by Helm Housing. I think that is what the Member is getting at. The real  issue is whether the social housing budget will provide new homes to people in  need and disadvantaged communities, and work for those in the construction  industry who have no work. Will that budget line have a higher priority and  protection in budget negotiations?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>:  Given that many in Strangford are facing the first elements of repossession,  what advice would the Minister&rsquo;s Department give to people who are struggling  with their mortgage arrears, particularly in relation to correspondence on a  recent high court judgement? What support can be given to people so that they  do not have to leave their homes and go into the social housing market?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank the Member for his timely question. There are  three pieces of advice. First, people who find themselves in mortgage  difficulties should seek advice immediately. One of the great features of  Northern Ireland society is the quality, range and expertise of those who give  advice, especially in the independent and community advice sectors. Secondly,  my Department, through a scheme run with the Housing Rights Service, gives  advice to people in acute mortgage arrears, even at the door of the Chancery  Court, in an effort to try to avoid repossession and to deal with the mortgage  debt. Thirdly, on a number of occasions, I and my predecessor, Margaret  Ritchie, proposed to run a scheme to try to help people in mortgage arrears.  That issue was highlighted again yesterday by people in negative equity in the  Village area. As far as we can, my Department, the Department of Finance and  Personnel (DFP) and the Executive must try to scope out that issue to see  whether there are any interventions that might help people in those  circumstances.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  The Minister spoke about the Comber and Newtownards area. Will he comment on  the villages on the peninsula? People in Ballyhalbert have been waiting for  about 20 years for six houses, and those in Kircubbin have been waiting for  about five years for seven houses. It is the small pockets where we have land &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Question, please.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McCarthy</strong>:  When will we see houses on the ground in those villages?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I cannot answer specifically on one site or another at  this stage. On a general note, a large number of newbuilds will be built in the  Strangford constituency in the coming year. The plan is to build 484 new social  homes there, and, although I am unsure whether that will affect the sites that  the Member named, that demonstrates that the housing need &mdash; it has always been  about housing need &mdash; is being addressed through the Department&rsquo;s housing  programme.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not deny that there will be pockets of need and  general need in that constituency. Indeed, there are over 4,700 on the housing  transfer list in Strangford, and, of those, 2,500 are in housing stress, with  156 in great need in Comber alone. What all of that demonstrates is that,  whatever the top line may be from London during the negotiations for Budget  2011-15, the bottom line must be that those areas of need, be they villages in  the Strangford constituency or elsewhere in the North, must be addressed  through the budget for newbuild housing.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Warm Homes Scheme</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">2. <strong>Mr T  Clarke </strong>asked the Minister for Social Development why his Department changed  the criteria which allowed people in receipt of rates relief to benefit from  the warm homes scheme. &nbsp;(AQO 150/11<a name="AQO150/11" id="AQO150/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank the Member for his question. He highlights a  particular issue, and his question gives me an opportunity, either on behalf of  the Department or the Housing Executive, to hold our hands up. There is an  error, which is now being corrected, in the information that has been put out  about the warm homes scheme.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In one way, the error was understandable, because it  involved a complex and technical matter. Rates relief is given to people in the  private sector who live in properties with excessive rates but who do not  qualify for the warm homes scheme because of their income levels. Those who  live in private properties and are entitled to make applications under the warm  homes scheme qualify for rates rebate, which is different from rates relief. As  a result of that difference and the misunderstanding and confusion that arose  over it, there was, as I understand it, an error made in the information about  access to the warm homes scheme. That error is now being corrected. However, a  more important point is that the qualifying criteria that were laid down in  2009 have not changed one iota over the past couple of years. Yes, I am  currently reviewing the warm homes scheme, but the qualifying criteria have not  changed. I apologise for the mistake that was made.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr T Clarke</strong>:  Rates relief/benefit was one of the qualifying criteria for the warm homes  scheme, and people in private homes who may be living in fuel poverty have been  discriminated against because they cannot apply for the scheme.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: As I said, rates relief is not a qualifying benefit or  entitlement for accessing the warm homes scheme, the reason being that it is a  consequence of high rates being paid by homeowners rather than them necessarily  being on low incomes. There is a difference.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The warm homes scheme has been very successful, and I hope  to be able to tweak and develop it over the next number of years. If money is  to be spent on the scheme to deal with the up to 30% of people who are already in  fuel poverty and the 40% plus who could be in it this year and next, it seems  highly appropriate that that money should be targeted. The best group to target  is those who live in low-income households, who are just beyond the threshold  for housing benefit and who get rates relief. Targeting those moneys at those  who are in the greatest need and on those levels of incomes seems to be a more  judicious and proportionate use of resources.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Maskey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I appreciate that the Minister has  stated that he made a mistake, but he has not told us when that mistake will be  rectified. That is an important point, because there are those, including  elderly people in his own constituency, who are being pushed into fuel poverty.  When will that issue be addressed? Will the Minister rectify the situation as  soon as possible?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I did not concede that I had made a mistake: I accepted  that a mistake was made between the Department and/or the Housing Executive. I  am accountable, as Minister, and, therefore, I accept the responsibility. I may  not have made the mistake personally, but it comes back to me in my collective  capacity.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">People are not being pushed into fuel poverty because of  this matter. The qualifying criteria for the warm homes scheme have not  changed. Therefore, the mistake had no bearing on any individual application to  the warm homes scheme. In that regard, the Member is in error. The real issue  is that three factors give rise to fuel poverty; income, suitable home  insulation and the cost of heating. Those are the three factors that drive  people into fuel poverty. Fuel poverty is not a consequence of an error in a  document. It is a consequence of those three factors.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If we are to have a Budget that is fit for purpose, and  that lives up to the needs of those living in fuel poverty, disadvantage,  stress, alienation and deprivation, the Executive have to make a value choice &mdash;  every party and every Minister have to make a choice &mdash; that, when it comes to  the warm homes scheme, we will not only protect the budget line but enhance it,  so that, when we have a Budget, it is a Budget that protects those in need.  That is the real issue. It is not a question of an error in one word; it is a  question about a fundamental value choice. I hope that the Member, and all  Members, will answer that question positively.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Armstrong</strong>:  Will the Minister update the House on the potential introduction of a boiler  replacement scheme?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank the Member for that very important question. A  boiler scrappage scheme was announced by the London Government. However, that  scheme did not apply to Northern Ireland. During the consultation on taking the  warm homes scheme forward, which finished last week, I put in a question  explicitly about the boiler scrappage scheme. In my budget bid, I have said  that I would like part of the warm homes scheme, which I referred to in my  answer to Mr Maskey&rsquo;s question, to include a boiler scrappage scheme. However,  any scheme that I recommend will not be based on the model used in England,  which took a first come, first served approach. If there is going to be a  boiler scrappage scheme here, it needs to be based on the broader criteria of  those who are in most need and those who would enjoy most advantage. That is  the sort of scheme that I intend to take forward, and I hope to make an  announcement about that in the near future.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  Will the Minister give an assessment of how the warm homes scheme has contributed  to the alleviation of fuel poverty?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank the Member for her answer. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.] </span>Let me repeat that: I thank the Member for her question.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I can confirm that, in the previous financial year, because  of the work of Margaret Ritchie, the Department, the Housing Executive and  others, we exceeded our target and assisted more than 9,000 households with  energy efficiency improvements. That is devolution working on behalf of those  in need. At the time when people made their applications and were assessed for  the warm homes scheme, they also got a benefit check. Therefore, as a  consequence, there may have been a greater take-up of benefit entitlement by  those in need.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In this financial year, &pound;20&middot;5 million has been committed to  tackling fuel poverty. However, the issue is whether I will have &pound;20&middot;5 million,  or more, next year, so that another 9,000 people, or more, can qualify under  the scheme.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Egan Contracts</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">3. <strong>Mr  Butler </strong>asked the Minister for Social Development whether expected budget  restrictions will impact on the delivery of Egan contracts in the near future. &nbsp;(AQO 151/11<a name="AQO151/11" id="AQO151/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">2.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: We cannot anticipate whether there will be further  changes to the in-year budgetary situation because there are still six months  of the financial year to come, and there may be further budgetary pressures on  the Northern Ireland Executive in that period. However, in the absence of  further changes, and if we are able to roll out the Budget, and the Egan-style  contracts in particular, as we anticipate at the beginning of the financial  year, &pound;30 million will be allocated to Egan-style contracts for a significant  number of maintenance and repair works. Subject to that caveat, that is what I  intend to do, and I anticipate that it will happen.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Butler</strong>: I  thank the Minister for his answer. I understand that the Minister met those  involved in the Egan contracts recently. He is aware that any reduction in the  money available to the Egan contracts would impact greatly not only on those  whom they employ but on many small businesses that avail themselves of the  moneys that come from his Department. I am glad that he is not rolling over in  the current climate of Tory cuts, and I hope that he will fight any reduction  in his budget. I also hope that he has taken on board the fact that the Egan  contracts play an important role in the housing sector.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I appreciate what the Member said. He will appreciate  that, given that nearly 40,000 people are on the housing transfer list, of whom  almost 20,000 are in housing need, my priority and that of Margaret Ritchie is  the building of new social homes. I welcome the Member&rsquo;s indication that he  supports me in protecting my budget lines; I hope that that sentiment will  prevail over the next number of months and years.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I was pleased to meet the Egan contractors. I have ensured,  and I make no apology for doing so, that the release of moneys for Egan-style  contracts is conducted at a proportionate pace over the course of the year.  There was the potential for far too much money to be released earlier in the  year, which would have given rise to a situation in the latter months of the  financial year in which there would be no money or new contracts. The release  of money on a phased basis &mdash; &pound;19 million of a &pound;30 million budget had been  released by the middle of September &mdash; seems to me to be a proportionate and  reasonable release of moneys to provide the much-needed improvements to  people&rsquo;s homes.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr D Bradley</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire as  na freagra&iacute; a thug s&eacute; go dt&iacute; seo. Will the Minister detail the funding that has  been available to the Egan contracts over the past two years?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank the Member for his question. As I said, the  budget line is &pound;30 million, of which &pound;19 million was released in the first six  months of this financial year. There is a balance of &pound;11 million to be  released. I expect that that will be released and that the full budget line  will be discharged. That is on top of the &pound;40 million that was released for  Egan-style contracts last year. Given the situation on which Saville reported,  namely that 0&middot;2% of social housing in the Housing Executive sector was unfit,  that is a measure of the Housing Executive&rsquo;s commitment to maintaining its  housing stock and ensuring that people have homes of a decent standard.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: The  Minister may be aware that people living in 40 or 50 homes in the Monkstown  estate were under the impression that they would benefit from new schemes for  replacement windows and kitchens this year. Those people have now been informed  that they could be waiting for up to three years. I know that the Minister has  agreed to visit Monkstown and meet some of those residents. Is he able to give  any assurance that he may be able to bring some good news when he visits?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I went out of my way to ensure that I had the  opportunity to visit Monkstown. I used to travel through the Monkstown and  Rathcoole estates on my way to school years ago, so I am very familiar with the  area. I am glad to accept Mr Ross&rsquo;s invitation to visit.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I will have to come back to the Member on the  issues of replacement windows and the like, but my predecessor and I are not  minded to go down the road of multi-element schemes for Housing Executive stock  &mdash; the Housing Executive carrying out a large number of improvements to every  property in a locality. We are trying to protect the budget lines that the  Member talks about for new windows, improving home insulation, new boilers and  new kitchens. Such budget lines are a proper use of the public purse rather  than multi-element schemes, which upgraded all properties, regardless of  whether they were in the same level of need.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Welfare Reform</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">4. <strong>Mr P J  Bradley </strong>asked the Minister for Social Development for his assessment of the  impact of UK welfare reform proposals in Northern Ireland, in the next three  years. &nbsp;(AQO 152/11<a name="AQO152/11" id="AQO152/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank the Member for his question. It is timely,  given that yesterday afternoon at 5.00 pm, I left my latest meeting with the  Welfare Minister, Lord Freud, in London. The detail will be aired more fully in  the debate that will follow Question Time, but there are two strategic issues  and threats to welfare and to those who are on benefits in the North. In the  longer term, it will be the outcome of Iain Duncan Smith&rsquo;s consultation on  twenty-first century reform of the welfare benefits system. I anticipate that  the fog will clear on 20 October, by which stage we will know where the balance  of power will lie in the Department for Work and Pensions and the Treasury on  the future shape of welfare. I will reserve comment on that until the debate on  the issue.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The second issue is the immediate period between now and  the end of this financial year and the next two years before welfare benefit  reform might be imposed in 2013. I raised a range of issues yesterday with Lord  Freud, including cold weather payments, the change in mortgage interest rates  for people on benefits, the extension of the 2009 mortgage relief scheme, which  is due to end in January, and the migration of people from incapacity benefit  to employment and support allowance (ESA) and how that could adversely affect  people who are legitimately ill and on benefits. Northern Ireland is still in  recession, and it will continue to be so until 2012. There may be fewer public  sector jobs, and we face the possibility of a double dip in the neighbouring  economy in the Republic of Ireland. Through no fault of their own, people are  not in work; therefore how can they be penalised, given the adverse economic  conditions in Northern Ireland? That conundrum, that inconsistency and that  threat to people on benefits are at the heart of my negotiations with Lord  Freud, Iain Duncan Smith and his colleagues.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P J Bradley</strong>:  I hope that the Minister does not ask me to repeat all that he told me. Will  the expected cost associated with welfare reform be adequately reflected in the  forthcoming Budget?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: We do not know the anticipated costs for the roll-out  of welfare reform, although we will know them in the near future. However, the  question is appropriate because all the figures suggest that a big change to  the welfare system would cost excessive amounts upfront. Therefore, if the  London Treasury and Iain Duncan Smith get their way for a radical shake-up of  the welfare benefits system, vast sums of money will have to be paid upfront to  put it in place.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">If something will cost that much money up front at  a time when we have been told that there is less money generally, it seems that  the inevitable and logical consequence will be more savings up front in  headline benefit rates. That seems the natural conclusion of the conversation  that appears to be taking place between the Treasury and the Department for  Work and Pensions. Although the Treasury says that it will fund a radical  shake-up of the benefits system, it will penalise the Department in respect of  benefits rates. The bottom line is that that will impact on a vast number of  people in Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. The Minister has already mentioned  people on benefits who have problems paying their mortgages. A large number of  people who get help with their mortgages and are in receipt of benefits have  already been affected. Does the Minister accept that people&rsquo;s homes could be in  danger? Will he explain to the House whether he intends to take action sooner  rather than later? Obviously, we await the outcomes of various negotiations and  talks about budgets, and so on. A large number of people are already in danger  of losing their homes.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I thank the Member for his question. My reply has two  elements. The first concerns policy, which I mentioned earlier. Yesterday, I  argued with Lord Freud that the Labour Government&rsquo;s 2009 assistance scheme for  people who became unemployed and had difficulty in paying their mortgages  should be extended beyond January 2011, when it is due to finish. Furthermore,  I argued that the reduction in the rate of mortgage interest that would be paid  by people who are on benefits and still paying a mortgage &mdash; given that there will  be a reduction of the interest rate payment to around 3&middot;65% &mdash; would result in  7,000 people in Northern Ireland being penalised. I said that that was unjust,  inequitable and would penalise people who are trying to keep their homes in a  way that would put them under further financial pressure and result in the loss  of their homes.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In respect of the second element, I refer to my previous  answer. Dozens of people have been helped by money that we have put into  housing rights to help those who, often, are at the doors of the court and face  repossession. I believe that we have been able to help around 15% of people who  have appeared before the chancery division to avoid repossession, but I will  verify that figure. If it is correct, it suggests that that is a useful  intervention. Let us build on that. Let us provide additional money for  mortgage protection schemes, which the Executive have not funded to date, and  for housing rights advice to enable people who get into debt to better manage  their funds and to better negotiate with their building society or bank to  reduce the stress that they are in.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McHugh</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Can the Minister tell me why much  welfare reform attacks less-well-off people and, indeed, the National Health Service,  which was the envy of Europe because it provided support from cradle to grave?  It will now need to be paid for from conception to grave. That attack is aimed  at less-well-off people in particular.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I broadly concur with that sentiment. Whatever spin the  Treasury puts on the emergency Budget, the hard and cold fact is that a  middle-of-the-road organisation, the Institute for Fiscal Studies, concluded  that the emergency Budget in June had a disproportionate impact on the poor.  Around four weeks ago, the BBC confirmed that research that it commissioned  showed that areas of Northern Ireland and Britain that relied heavily on the  public sector would suffer disproportionately when it comes to public service  cuts. That is pretty self-evident.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The TUC&rsquo;s recent research confirmed that all indications,  particularly reports that the Chancellor was trying to cut an extra &pound;4 billion  from the benefits system, would have a disproportionate impact on poor, needy  and disadvantaged people. Therefore, I conclude that there is still a Tory wolf  in the London Government, who masquerade as a coalition Government in grey  suits.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">If we do not measure up to the negotiation with  London over the next number of weeks on minimising welfare impact on the North  and maximising the budget, that situation might deepen.</p>

    <p class="OralAnswers-H2DepartmentHeading"><a name="g"></a>Agriculture and Rural Development</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Rural Development Programme</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">1. <strong>Mr Ross </strong>asked the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development for her assessment  of the level of funding currently committed under axis 3 of the rural  development programme. (AQO 164/11<a name="AQO164/11" id="AQO164/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development (Ms Gildernew)</strong>: Go raibh maith agat, a  LeasCheann Comhairle. Resources to the value of some &pound;12&middot;5 million have been  committed in letters of offer that have been issued under axis 3 of the rural  development programme. That is across all six measures within the axis,  including farm diversification, tourism, rural business and village renewal. In  addition, a further &pound;9&middot;7 million of grants have been approved, and letters of  offer are being prepared. Therefore, a total of &pound;22&middot;2 million has been  committed, so far, in the axis. It is worth noting that in excess of &pound;15&middot;4  million of that &pound;22&middot;2 million has been committed in this financial year. Although  that is good news, I am not complacent.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is my strong belief that axis 3 spend needs to be  increased significantly, and I am concerned about the slow progress of that  axis compared with the rest of the rural development programme. The progress has  been slow, despite the fact that we have made available a very large amount of  financial resources for the administration of axis 3. Nevertheless, it appears  that large numbers of applications are not moving to letter of offer stage  quickly enough. Additionally, some applications are being withdrawn, and the  local action groups do not always know why. All of that has led to a  disappointing amount of funds going to rural communities by way of hard cash.  That is not satisfactory. I have asked my officials to find out what and where  the blockages are and to report back to me as a matter of urgency.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Member will know that, when I set up the local action  groups, I asked councils to look after the administration and finance. At that  time, the review of public administration was imminent, and we were expecting  that there would be a solid agreed cluster of councils, which would be in a  position to look after the axis and to integrate it into a new and innovative  local government structure. That has not happened. The clusters are a loose  amalgam within the current 26-council structure. It is right, therefore, to  assess the viability of continuing with such a system, and I intend to do so.  My main concern, however, is to ensure that those funds get to the rural communities  who need assistance, particularly in this difficult economic climate. I will  look critically at the working of the axis. I have asked officials to produce  the relevant facts and figures for me, and I will not shirk from the hard  decisions that will ensure that the funding gets to the people for whom it is  meant as quickly as possible.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Ross</strong>: I  thank the Minister for her comprehensive answer. She alluded to the  disappointment in the rural community over how funding is getting to the  people. What is the projected spend for the closure of the project in 2011? If  all the moneys are not spent by the end of the project, will they be rolled  over to a new scheme, or will they have to be returned to Europe?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: I assure the Member and the House that I  do not intend to hand money back to Europe. At this point, it is my absolute  desire to see all the money identified for axis 3, which is &pound;100 million, to be  spent within that axis. Therefore, it is appropriate and timely to review  progress to ensure that everything that can be done is being done or that we  change things in time to get the spend out, if change is needed. I am also  looking at the other challenges that exist in getting match funding from the  banks, for instance, and at whether planning permission is a problem. I  recognise that there are complex reasons why people do not progress to letter  of offer stage, but I will look at those in great detail and do everything that  I can to ensure that whatever decisions need to be made to get to that magic  figure of &pound;100 million will be made.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Leonard</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. How much of the money committed is  for investment in farm diversification? How much has been spent?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: I am having difficulty finding the  correct notes; that shows how organised I am. Gabh mo leithsc&eacute;al, a LeasCheann  Comhairle. I apologise to the Member. Farm families have welcomed the  opportunity to increase farm incomes through diversification projects, and the  measure is becoming well subscribed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">To date, 172 letters of offer have been issued for  diversification projects to a value of over &pound;4 million. Projects are moving  ahead, and almost &pound;1 million has already been spent on them. That is where we  see the benefits of axis 3, which include creating more work on farms and  creating the possibility of further employment. Some of my best days out have  been to farm diversification projects around all constituencies, where I have seen  how innovative and creative our rural communities can be in bringing forward  ideas that benefit not only our tourism potential but the services that are  available for local rural communities.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McGlone</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Aire as  ucht an fhreagra sin. I thank the Minister for her answer. She, quite rightly,  identified slow progress. Will she explain how much of that slow progress was  on the part of the Department? I remember from my time on the Committee that we  had inordinate waits for the Department to make progress in getting money and  investment out into the community so that we could see development and jobs  being created. Can the Minister clarify whether the criteria were tweaked or  changed by the Department during their evolution?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: As I have said many times in the House,  I am determined to cut bureaucracy from my Department, and that includes in  this scheme. However, money spent in axis 3 is public money, and the Member  will know that it is money that comes not only from the Assembly but from  Europe, and the Commission, as we heard yesterday, demands tight inspections  and controls. I have given the House an undertaking that I will ensure that, if  there are hiccups caused by my Department, I will find them, wherever they are,  and &mdash; to use the word that the Member used &mdash; I will tweak the scheme to ensure  that there are no difficulties at Department level.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Given the history of the scheme, the fact that the RPA was  not as successful as we had hoped it would be has probably led to some  difficulties. I know that there are very good people working on the scheme. As  a European obligation, it is a bottom-up scheme. I accept that it has taken  longer than I would have liked to get that scheme up and running properly, but  I am hoping that the pace will take off now and that we will get more letters  of offer out and get hard cash into the communities that need it most.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  Given that axis 3 and axis 1 funding involves rural development and economic  development in the countryside through tourism, community development, good  relations etc and that, as the Minister has said, the RPA failed to go through,  how is she ensuring that duplication &mdash; the structures do not match together &mdash;  is avoided in local government and confusion is avoided, so that we get value  for money with this expenditure?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: That is why I am looking at the progress  that has been made to date. If there has been duplication, I want to know about  it, and I will undertake a wide-ranging review to ensure that no unnecessary  levels to go through are preventing spend on projects. I recognise that it took  a while to get us where we want to be. If we do not see those schemes going  ahead, I will be asking why. It is important that people who come forward with  good ideas get the support that they need from the local action groups, the  joint council committees and the Department to ensure that their ideas are progressed,  they get the letters out and they spend the money to benefit not only the rural  community, through making services available, but the rural economy.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The Member who tabled question 2 is not in his place.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">DARD: Budget</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">3. <strong>Dr  Farry </strong>asked the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development to outline  her plans for her departmental budget over the forthcoming comprehensive  spending review period. &nbsp;(AQO 166/11<a name="AQO166/11" id="AQO166/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: As the House is aware, the prospects for  the public finances are very difficult, given that the British Government have  made tackling the fiscal deficit their number-one priority. DFP has made a  number of working assumptions about the level of cuts that might be needed to  balance the books and fund cost pressures. I have been given the opportunity to  submit bids for new proposals and pressures, and I have done so. At the  Executive, we have already had discussions about the evolving Budget position.  I expect that to continue into the autumn and beyond before the funding  decisions can be made. We have begun to plan internally, but it is too early at  this stage to say how we will deliver any savings that the Executive finally  decide on.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  How much further into the future does the Department need to project to take  into account the risk of a further EU disallowance in relation to single farm  payments? Is that not a major opportunity cost problem in the context of a  tight public expenditure round?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: The issue of disallowance was covered  significantly yesterday, as was the fact that the impact of the disallowance  will not be felt by DARD&rsquo;s budget. As the Member knows, we have bid for an  amount, and the CSR period runs over four years. Many of us talked to the trade  unions that were in the Building today about how we can fight cuts and try to  work together. I know that the First Minister and deputy First Minister are in  London today to speak to the Chancellor. It is important that we fight cuts as  best we can. I assure the Member that internal planning is being undertaken,  but it will be some weeks before we are ready to make those plans public. It  would be imprudent of me to offer up savings that might have a knock-on effect  that damages the rural economy when I might not have to offer up those savings  at all.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McElduff</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Will the Minister detail her  Department&rsquo;s attitude to the possible relocation of its headquarters? I wish to  flag up Omagh as a suitable location. I know that my colleague Martina Anderson  has often flagged up Orchard House as a suitable location for any expansion  project. However, Sperrin House and Omagh have a strong public sector  tradition. Will the Minister outline her views on the matter?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: Anybody who has ever been to our  headquarters at Dundonald House will be aware that the building is coming to  the end of its useful life. During the Budget period, I anticipate that new accommodation  will need to be identified. That presents the Executive with an opportunity to  address the recommendations in the Bain report on the relocation of public  sector jobs and to consider the benefits of ensuring that quality public sector  jobs are available in rural communities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It would be symbolic and practical if the Executive  addressed the recommendation that at least one departmental HQ should be  considered for relocation, and the report identified DARD&rsquo;s headquarters as the  most suitable option in that respect. However, I do not want to get involved in  a fight between Ms Anderson and Mr McElduff about where the headquarters should  be located. That is one decision that I hope that I do not have to make. If  relocation goes ahead during this CSR period, it would genuinely benefit rural  communities.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P J Bradley</strong>:  As food production remains one of our key industries, what assurance will the  Minister give that those involved in production and processing cycles will be  given special protection by her Department in the forthcoming spending review?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: I can give the Member absolutely no  assurance about that, given the cuts that we are looking at and the savings  that the Executive will have to make. It would be absolutely foolish of me to  stand here and say that we intend to ring-fence a certain sector. We must look  at everything. Nothing is not on the table, and difficult decisions must be  made. It would not be right if I stood up here today and said that I was going  to ring-fence a certain sector in my Department. However, what I can say to the  House is that I am absolutely committed to protecting front line services for  the benefit of famers and rural communities.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kennedy</strong>:  Given that it is anticipated that the Minister&rsquo;s Department will see a &pound;10  million year-on-year reduction, will she detail precisely what savings she  envisages her Department being able to make before any cutbacks impact on front  line services?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: As the Member is aware, delivering  savings of that magnitude will be difficult for DARD, given that so much of  what my Department does is either a statutory obligation or a direct service to  our customers. The savings proposals that I will consult on must be realistic  and sustainable, and it is important to get them right. I want the savings  proposals to be as fully formed as possible before I consult stakeholders. I am  aware that identifying options for savings could alarm customers and staff, and  I do not want to cause concern by releasing material prematurely or by putting  forward options that will not be needed. Rest assured that, when I am ready to  release material, I will consult rural stakeholders and take account of their  views.</p>

    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Single Farm Payments</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">4. <strong>Ms Lo </strong>asked  the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development for an update on the  disallowances levied in relation to single farm payments. &nbsp;(AQO 167/11<a name="AQO167/11" id="AQO167/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: The Member will be aware that I made a  full statement on the issue of single farm payment disallowance yesterday, and  I refer her to the detailed content in Hansard.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I explained in my statement, we are working hard to  resolve the disallowance issue in three main areas: challenge, compliance and  enforcement. One important aspect of that challenge is an approach to the  European Court of Justice to have the Commission&rsquo;s decision annulled. A  critical area for compliance is the introduction as soon as possible of a  revised mapping system, and the Department is also strengthening its inspection  arrangements. On enforcement, I want farm businesses to know that it is vital  that they ensure that their farm maps are correct and that they are claiming  only eligible land. The Department can provide support and advice if the farmer  approaches it, but, if the Department comes to the farmer to carry out an  inspection, the penalties for negligent or intentional breaches are severe.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">During the questions that followed my statement yesterday,  I pointed out that farm businesses that have proactively notified changes to  their farm maps will have the changes applied from this year only. Indeed, that  is the situation at present. However, I want to add the caveat that the  Department has an obligation to recover eventually any moneys due from previous  years. It remains the case that any penalties that may result from such  retrospective calculation are likely to be significantly less than would be the  case following an inspection.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Overall, this is an important body of work, and we continue  to work with farmers and their representatives to make the process better. I  appreciate the support that my Assembly colleagues have given, and I will keep  them updated on progress with the mapping project and the other disallowance  issues as they arise.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: I  thank the Minister for her thorough reply. Does she accept that the underspend  in her departmental budget that was redirected to cover disallowances could  have been surrendered in monitoring rounds and reinvested in the education  system and in health services?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: Again, we covered that issue yesterday.  It is not possible to identify some underspends early enough in the year, given  that we are an outward-looking Department and some of the underspend was for,  for example, animal disease. We had worked hard on trying to eradicate diseases  such as TB and brucellosis. We had bid for compensation for a period in the  future. It was later in the year when the work that we had done towards  eradication proved to be successful, so we did not need as much compensation.  Our Department is not the only one that had underspends, and we have been lucky  that we have been able to use past underspend to deal with the situation. Over  a number of years, all Departments have tightened up, and much less underspend  is being announced at the end of the year now than was the case previously.  Nobody wants to see underspends. We all want to see every penny spent. However,  it can be difficult when we do not know what the implications of disease  outbreak may be for the Department and its budget.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Kinahan</strong>:  I was concerned yesterday when I heard the Minister be rather indifferent to  the potential of a fine of &pound;100 million being imposed, as the money was coming  from the Treasury rather than the Executive. Will the Minister detail what  discussions she has had with the Chancellor of the Exchequer or what  discussions she is planning to have?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: My discussions on the matter have  primarily been with colleagues in DEFRA. I say again that at no point did I  feel that I was being indifferent to the House. This is a huge issue, and, on  more than one occasion yesterday, I said that I regretted that, because of the  way in which we have handled the situation, there is an impact on the  Treasury&rsquo;s spending power. At no point was I indifferent. I know that that is  not a view shared by my colleague from Fermanagh and South Tyrone Lord Morrow,  but that is probably more of a constituency issue than a genuine reflection of  what I said in the House yesterday. I refer the Member to Hansard to see what I  said.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">This is a serious issue. A huge amount of money is  involved: &pound;64 million in the past, and we have bid for &pound;40 million as a prudency  measure, although I am hoping that we will not use it. Therefore, the figure of  &pound;100 million is not necessarily a fair one. However, I accept that even &pound;64  million is an awful lot of money that is not available to the Treasury, and  that is regrettable. I repeat what I said yesterday, and I assure the House  that I have not been indifferent on the matter at all. I take the situation  very seriously.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Fisheries Forum</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">5. <strong>Mrs  O&rsquo;Neill </strong>asked the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development for her  assessment of the recommendations of the Fisheries Forum and how she will take  these forward. &nbsp;(AQO 168/11<a name="AQO168/11" id="AQO168/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: The forum, which represents a wide  spectrum of experience and expertise from the fishing industry and the marine  environment, was set up to advise me on a long-term strategy to develop a  sustainable and profitable future for the sector. I welcome the forum&rsquo;s report,  and I fully support its vision of having a sustainable, profitable and  self-reliant seafood and aquaculture industry.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The forum has presented a practical and realisable vision  for the industry, and I am fully committed to helping it to achieve that  vision. To that end, my Department has developed an implementation plan with a  clear timetable to deliver most of the report&rsquo;s recommendations. Financial  resources will also be made available through the EFF to ensure the effective  delivery of the changes that are needed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The report is not just about what government should do.  Change can happen only through greater partnership between government and  industry and between the sectors in that industry. That is reflected in the  implementation plan, which contains actions for all stakeholders in taking  forward the report&rsquo;s recommendations.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A key issue that the forum considered was the size of the  fleet and the fishing opportunities available to it. There is evidence to  suggest that the current balance is not right, and it has been recommended that  my Department develop a decommissioning scheme to reduce the size of the fleet.  I agree in principle that decommissioning should be examined further, and, as  we enter the autumn negotiations on opportunities for 2011, I am very aware of the  impact that further cuts in quota and fishing effort will have on our fleet. It  is an emotive issue, and many in the industry have concerns that such a scheme  could have unintended consequences. I am particularly aware of the concerns of  the fish processing sector and of the need to ensure that supplies of raw  material are maintained. Therefore, I asked my Department to prepare a business  case to examine critically the need for decommissioning, its value for money,  the design of possible schemes and the impact that such schemes would have on  all sectors of the industry.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I believe that the forum has provided a unique and valuable  opportunity for the wide range of interests in the fishing industry to come  together to tackle the challenges that it faces. I want it to continue to be  involved in the implementation of the report&rsquo;s recommendations. I take this  opportunity to thank the members of the Fisheries Forum for their very valuable  work.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs O&rsquo;Neill</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her detailed answer. What assistance is available for  fishermen under the EFF?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: The European Fisheries Fund is worth  about &pound;28 million and is available for the development of the fleet. Just under  &pound;4&middot;7 million has been committed to projects so far. The fund&rsquo;s vessel  modernisation measure is now open, and that will provide some &pound;2&middot;5 million of  grant support. Under that measure, grants of up to 60% are available to improve  fishing vessels that are less than 12 m long and use static gear. Larger  vessels that use trawls and other mobile gear can receive grants of up to 40%.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A number of projects received 100% EFF support when they  were undertaken by the industry rather than by individual fishermen. An  excellent example of such collective action is the provision of &pound;260,000 of  grant support towards fitting the entire fleet with larger square mesh panels  and cod ends to improve cod conservation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The collective actions measure of the EFF remains open for  applications, and the &pound;700,000 small-scale coastal fishing measure will be  opening on receipt of economists&rsquo; approval of the business case. That approval  is being sought.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Bell</strong>: I  thank the Minister for the work that is being done to help the fishing  industry, on which my Strangford constituency is so dependent. What are the  Minister&rsquo;s views on the quota system? Many in Strangford want to make their and  their family&rsquo;s livelihood in fishing. Is the quota system fair, or could we be  doing better for Northern Ireland? Secondly, if only &pound;4&middot;5 million of the &pound;28  million is being used, is there any way to make the system less complex, so  that we can get a better uptake?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: We are not dealing with the same  timescales on EFF, and it has not been open for as long as the rural  development programme, for example, which we heard about earlier. Therefore,  the spend is getting out there relatively quickly, and I am content with that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As the Member is aware, the quota system is not a scheme of  our making, and it is difficult at times for us to fight our corner in Europe  and insist that we need a quota that people there do not necessarily agree  with. We work closely with scientists. They go out on fishing vessels, and they  work closely with the industry to come up with a figure that is realisable,  achievable and sustainable. We have to have that sustainability or we will not  have any credibility in Europe. As I said, other Fisheries Ministers and I go  out to Europe in November and December and argue our case, but that is a yearly  process. Obviously, the main part of those talks happens at the end of the  year, but we go out and put our case to the Commission.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The quota system has been difficult. As I said, the scheme  was not of the Department&rsquo;s making, and it has been challenging for our fishing  industry. However, we are committed to sustainable fishing communities, to the  jobs that are onshore as well as offshore and to the benefit to coastal  communities, particularly the three fishing villages. I will continue to work with  the industry and scientists to fight our corner in Europe and try to minimise  the impact of the quotas that are being applied to our fleet this year.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Ritchie</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her initial answer. First, what timescale does she  envisage for the publishing of the business case on decommissioning? When will  that report be coming back to her? Secondly, given the difficulties faced by  fishermen and those in the fish processing sector in the three fishing villages  in County Down, will she outline the discussions that she has had with the  DEFRA Fisheries Minister and representatives of the European Commission on the  different method of calculation that will be used for quota allocations at this  year&rsquo;s annual TAC debate in Brussels? Thirdly, what is her assessment of the  availability of mackerel and its potential to our fishing industry?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Minister, you have a choice of questions.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: I could be facetious and say &ldquo;December&rdquo;,  which would cover me. However, out of deference to my colleague, I will not do  that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is hoped that the business plan will be completed by  December. Discussions are ongoing, not just with the DEFRA Ministers but with  those from the devolved regions and, obviously, the South. I have meetings  scheduled with all those Ministers in the coming weeks and months. In a few  weeks, I will host an event in Belfast at which all the Fisheries Ministers and  the industry will get together to discuss this year&rsquo;s negotiations in November  and December and the tack that we will take.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I did not hear the Member&rsquo;s third question, but I am sure  that the House will want me to proceed.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">DARD: Orchard House</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">6. <strong>Mrs M  Bradley </strong>asked the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development how many  permanent staff have been employed by her Department in Orchard House, in each  of the last three years. &nbsp;(AQO 169/11<a name="AQO169/11" id="AQO169/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: DARD staff based in Orchard House  comprise those in both the grants and subsidies payments and single farm  payments business branches. Those branches are part of the rural payments  division in the service delivery group in DARD.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Over the past three years, the following numbers of staff  were employed in a permanent capacity by my Department at Orchard House: there  were 145 in April 2010; 147 in April 2009; and 149 in April 2008. The figures  have remained fairly consistent over the past three years.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  I thank the Minister for her answer. Has she agreed to any reduction in staff  numbers at Orchard House or to any relocation of her staff to other centres of  employment?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: I assure the Member that there are no  immediate plans to reduce the number of staff as a consequence of the  comprehensive spending review, nor are there immediate plans to move staff out  of Orchard House. The Member can be assured that things will stay as they are.</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-H3SubjectHeading">Horse Mussels</p>
    <p class="OralAnswers-Question">7. <strong>Mr Lunn </strong>asked the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development what steps she is  taking to protect horse mussels in Strangford Lough. (AQO 170/11<a name="AQO170/11" id="AQO170/11"></a>)</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Agriculture and Rural Development</strong>: Over the years, my Department has  introduced various measures to offer protection to the Strangford Lough  modiolus population, including the banning of dredging in parts of the lough in  1993 and a complete ban throughout the lough on fishing using mobile gear and  dredges, which was imposed in 2003 and remains in place. Those measures already  provide a significant degree of protection for modioli against the most  damaging forms of fishing activity.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My Department, along with DOE, has also developed a  modiolus restoration plan, which has a number of short, medium and long-term  objectives. Short-term objectives include a modiolus restoration project, which  is being carried out under contract by Queen&rsquo;s &mdash; Queen&rsquo;s University that is; I  knew that that would prick people&rsquo;s ears up &mdash; to identify and map modioli in  the lough, assess areas for restoration and to trial restoration methods. The  modiolus restoration group is due to report its findings early in 2011.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That report will help inform the development of appropriate  and feasible restoration measures to ultimately restore the modiolus biogenic  reef to favourable conservation status.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">3.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My Department and the Department of the Environment have  also been working closely to finalise non-disturbance zones in Strangford Lough  to give greater protection to areas containing the best remaining modiolus  communities. The establishment of non-disturbance zones is a requirement of the  restoration plan agreed with the European Commission. The location of the zones  has been complicated by the need to take account of the latest modiolus mapping  data and by the need to try to reconcile opposing views from stakeholders about  the measures needed. We have had draft legislation ready since last September  to introduce sea-fishing exclusion zones, and the Bill will quickly be  introduced as soon as the location of non-disturbance zones is finalised.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Once we have acted to introduce fishing exclusion zones &mdash;  the Member will not have a chance to ask a supplementary question, so I am  giving him my whole answer &mdash; it will be for other Departments to assess the  impact of activities for which they are responsible and take action, or  introduce appropriate measures if modioli are affected. I have spoken to other  Ministers about that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My Department has also worked closely with the Strangford  Lough Fishermen&rsquo;s Association. I will tell you what: I will give it up at that.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: You have anticipated well, Minister. There is no time for the  Member to ask a supplementary question. That concludes Question Time.</p>

    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Which amendment was:</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">At end insert</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">&ldquo;; and calls on the Executive to ensure that a revised  programme includes a clearly articulated vision of a cohesive, shared and  integrated society and an action plan covering policies, resource allocations,  targets, timetables and evaluation criteria.&rdquo; &mdash; [Mr Lyttle.]</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>: I  am tempted to defend good relations for horse mussels.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I declare an interest as a member of the Community  Relations Council (CRC). I also wish to set the record straight, in that the  CRC is not a state body but is independent. <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span></p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy Speaker</strong>:  Order, please. Allow the Member to be heard.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  Independence for the CRC is not one of the options for the delivery mechanisms.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Alliance Party supports the SDLP&rsquo;s motion and welcomes  the comments that Margaret Ritchie and other Members made about moving beyond  the concept of the two communities. We encourage the SDLP to follow through on  that, particularly on matters such as Assembly designation and how we monitor  ourselves as a society.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">To be fair to the SDLP, concerning the attack from the  Ulster Unionists as to the intent of the wording of the motion, I do not think  that the motion was aimed at achieving a separate but equal society. I am sure  that the SDLP will reinforce that point when winding on the motion.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome Chris Lyttle&rsquo;s maiden speech, which was very well  received by the House. Of course, he has already made numerous interventions  and asked many questions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Let me be clear about the Alliance Party&rsquo;s position. We  respect the progress that has been made on the issue. However, although we  recognise that there are some very positive themes in the CSI document as it  stands, it is flawed in many respects. Our amendment adds to the SDLP&rsquo;s motion  by teasing out what those flaws are. They are primarily a weak vision and the  lack of an action plan, including all the various elements that one might  expect to find in such a plan. It is our hope that the consultation exercise  will be treated seriously by the Office of the First Minister and the deputy  First Minister (OFMDFM) and the rest of the Executive, and that the responses  to the consultation will be reflected in a final document.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We are not rejecting the CSI programme &mdash; far from it. It is  a floor on which to build, but there is a great deal of work to be done to make  sure that we get the house right.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. Far be it from me to discourage conversation between  Members, but I need to hear the Member speak.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Some Members</strong>:  Hear, hear.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Dr Farry</strong>:  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I note Jimmy Spratt&rsquo;s remark that this is the beginning of  a process and that it is about achieving political agreement at the highest  strategic level. However, we should not settle for something weak and based on  that perspective. We acknowledge what has happened. All past initiatives on  good relations occurred under direct rule &mdash; integrated education, the Community  Relations Council and A Shared Future &mdash; but it is better that we have ownership  of the development and delivery of policy through our own institutions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There was nothing wrong with A Shared Future, but we accept  that, when they assumed office as part of the restoration of devolution, the  DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in wanted to shape their own document. That is democracy. The  problem has been the three years of drift. It is not acceptable to have a strategic  vacuum and to have independent decisions taken by Ministers over funding and  over what can be done. We need a proper, robust framework. We must push on.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We welcomed the agreement between the DUP and Sinn F&eacute;in in  February, but what was agreed was a reconciliation of those parties&rsquo; positions.  The Executive as a whole released the document for consultation in July. It is  important to make it clear that a number of parties had reservations about the  content at that stage.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the comments made by Danny Kinahan and the Ulster  Unionists, particularly those warning of the dangers of a Balkanised society.  Again, there is a challenge for the UUP to follow through on that. I hope that,  under the leadership of Tom Elliott, who I congratulate, they will do so.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I was concerned about some of the comments made by  representatives of Sinn F&eacute;in. Martina Anderson said that equality could not be  built on good relations. If that is true, it is a profoundly worrying statement  of intent from Sinn F&eacute;in. I fear that the concept of good relations coming from  that quarter has been misunderstood, and we were trying to tease that out. Sinn  F&eacute;in seems to regard good relations as being something cited to stop people  exercising their rights and culture in case it upsets someone. The same thing  happened in Switzerland with the referendum that banned the building of  minarets, because it was viewed as a threat to cohesion. That is wrong. Good  relations are about a shared society; not a society of unequals. To the Alliance  Party and many others, equality and good relations are completely  interdependent. I dare say that the situation would be helped if OFMDFM would  define what it means by &ldquo;good relations&rdquo;, &ldquo;cohesion&rdquo;, &ldquo;sharing&rdquo; and  &ldquo;integration&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The debate is an important one, and it is important that we  take heed of the consultation and, as a government and an Assembly, reflect the  views of the people. We must ensure that we follow the lead set by the people  of Northern Ireland who want to live in a shared society.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Your time is up.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  I thank all Members who participated in the debate, whatever their argument.  The Assembly is meant to be built on the principles of partnership and  reconciliation. This great House on a hill stands out to many of our younger  generation as a beacon to a new North and a new Ireland, yet, inside these  halls, too many cannot seem to shake off the mistrust of generations. Despite  hearing some very positive contributions today, we should all reflect on the  fact that some people&rsquo;s contributions have been guided more by mistrust of the  past than by a positive vision for tomorrow.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Sectarianism and the legacy of conflict linger, even here  in this Chamber. Some days, the politics of division chokes our work.  Sometimes, despite our diversity, it gets in the way of us being able to  envisage a shared and better region.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I met some young men and women in the Great Hall just over  an hour ago. They did not come here looking for a history lesson from one of  the newer MLAs. They wanted to know what we were doing about education and  jobs. They wanted to know what we were doing to protect their identity but  celebrate what we share, and yet I had to admit that, all too often, what they  hear coming from this Chamber is not talk of those things but of the past and,  unfortunately, of a future built on the worst prejudice of that past. Many of  us will have days when we wake up and think that we could do that generation a  much better service than we achieve.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Minister Newton and Allan Bresland spoke about the need for  leadership, but leadership must be about more than just being a gatekeeper to  your community. Protectionism in any form feeds prejudice, blocks partnership  and prevents leaders from envisaging a better future with a common goal of  sharing with respect and an understanding that equality and good relations are  both necessary conditions for trust and reconciliation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That thinking is particularly evident in the proposed  cohesion, sharing and integration strategy that we have been debating this  afternoon. I agree with George Robinson, who said that he was committed to  equality and good relations, but the problem with the document before us is  that it ignores the basic reality that there can be no equality without good  relations, and no good relations without equality.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms M Anderson</strong>:  Shame on you.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  That is not a statement of shame but of proud confidence, because good  relations, to me, mean solidarity. Good relations mean having the courage to  understand that my rights come with some pretty big responsibilities that I owe  to fellow men and women. I must understand that there are people with whom I  share any space &mdash; this space, this island, these islands &mdash; who have different  needs from me. I must not simply look at them, decide that a &ldquo;two for you, two  for me&rdquo; solution will meet my needs and theirs and try to convince myself that  that is an act of solidarity. That is no act of solidarity; it is an act of  selfishness. That is the issue at the heart of the debate, and it is the one  issue that one party in the Chamber chooses to ignore.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Good relations are about solidarity, trust, inclusion and  charity. I agree with Mr Farry that we should properly define &ldquo;good relations&rdquo;  in the document. If we do, good relations will become the basis on which we can  move forward. Paragraph 13 of the Good Friday Agreement states:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;The participants recognise and value the work being  done by many organisations to develop reconciliation and mutual understanding  and respect between and within communities and traditions, in Northern Ireland  and between North and South, and they see such work as having a vital role in  consolidating peace and political agreement. Accordingly, they pledge their  continuing support to such organisations and will positively examine the case  for enhanced financial assistance for the work of reconciliation. An essential  aspect of the reconciliation process is the promotion of a culture of tolerance  at every level of society, including initiatives to facilitate and encourage  integrated education and mixed housing.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">That is what we mean. That is not a statement of  shame. Those are the words that the overwhelming majority of the people of this  island endorsed. They are a reflection of modern Irish republicanism and the  most positive expression of modern Ulster unionism. That is what the House  should build on, not reject.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The strategy does not tackle the real issue. Instead, it  proposes a bureaucratic maze to cover up the lack of strategy. At a time when  we should be focused on tackling the cost of division, which is estimated at  more than &pound;1 billion a year, we are being offered a costly package of new  panels, groups, action plans and funders&rsquo; contracts. I will give Caitr&iacute;ona  Ruane this: she offered up some savings this year. The only problem is that she  offered them up from her community relations budget.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">To ignore the link between equality and good relations is a  denial of the real challenge that is posed by sectarianism and an abdication of  the politics that sent us here. As Danny Kinahan pointed out so eloquently, it  is equally dangerous to ignore the correlation between areas of social  disadvantage and high levels of sectarian conflict. The First Minister and  deputy First Minister&rsquo;s shelves creak under the weight of expensive research into  the complex causes, impacts and outcomes of such multiple disadvantages.  However, none of that thinking is evident in the strategy. It reminds us of  Albert Einstein&rsquo;s definition of insanity as:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;doing the same thing over and over again and  expecting different results.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Junior Minister Newton has been left alone. I hope that  junior Minister Kelly has not been taken unwell. If he has, I am sure that the  House will want to extend its best wishes to him. If he has not been taken  unwell, he has chosen to absent himself from the debate. That is a true signal  of what a shared future would look like under a DUP/Sinn F&eacute;in partnership  Government. From coequal office, in which they are joint junior Ministers, only  one has bothered to turn up. Mr Newton, left alone, will ask us to do the same  thing again and again and to expect a different outcome.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We did not come here simply to oppose. We came here because  we believe that, over the past decade, much good work has been done to try to  understand better how to build a shared society. Such work recognises some of  the following cross-cutting concepts and principles:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;the management of diversity by policy makers and  politicians will be of the utmost importance in the immediate years ahead &hellip;  policy makers should work proactively, garnering societal diversity for the  good of all society &hellip; it is important that a &lsquo;language&rsquo; of diversity is taken  further, not just for semantic purposes, but rather to underpin policy and  provide a public discourse that will aid achievement.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">The report in question also states that we should  &ldquo;no longer be consumed&rdquo; by the two-community analysis of our problem.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Those are not my words. They were written by Dr Billy  Leonard in his academic years, in 2001. I just wish that he could have a  conversation &mdash;</p>

    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. The Member will resume his seat. All remarks must be made  through the Chair; otherwise, some people may find that they will not be here  for the vote.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Leonard</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. Through the Chair, you got the  label wrong: republican. Will Mr McDevitt accept that those written words do  not automatically rubber-stamp the view that he is taking today?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McDevitt</strong>:  I will take my extra speaking time.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Storey</strong>:  You do not get extra time.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Devitt</strong>: I  do not get extra time? Unbelievable.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I never suggested that they did, but I know this: they are  words that make some sense. If those words were reflected in the document that  we are debating, it would be in my opinion, and, I hope, in Dr Leonard&rsquo;s too, a  better document.

    <p class="H3SubHeading"><a name="i"></a>Private Members&rsquo; Business</p>
    <p class="H4StageHeading">Welfare Reform</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Order. Members should resume their seats or leave quietly. The  Business Committee has agreed to allow up to one hour and 30 minutes for the  debate. The proposer of the motion will have 10 minutes to propose and 10  minutes to make a winding-up speech. All other Members who wish to speak will  have five minutes.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  I beg to move</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly acknowledges Northern Ireland&rsquo;s high  dependency on social security benefits; supports reforms which are aimed at  simplifying the social security process and helping people to get back to work;  and calls on the Minister for Social Development to continue his dialogue with  the Department for Work and Pensions, stressing the need for the special social  and economic circumstances of Northern Ireland to be carefully considered and  urging the introduction of appropriate measures to ensure that the proposed  welfare reforms do not have a disproportionately negative impact on Northern  Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">This is one of those very rare motions that I am involved  in during which I will not assail the Minister or attack anyone but will try to  encourage him. I am going weak and soft; there is something wrong. I am sure  that I will find some opportunity at a later stage to attack the Minister.  However, on this occasion, I will try to be nice and encouraging to him in the  very difficult job that he has ahead &mdash; <span class="Italic">[Interruption.]</span> I am being called all sorts of names, Mr Deputy Speaker. You will have to rule  some people out of order.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We are all very much aware of the very high level of  dependency on social security in Northern Ireland. One analysis that I looked  at when developing the motion was that of Graham Gudgin from Oxford Economics.  He analysed one of the Varney reports &mdash; I think it was the second one &mdash; that  showed how the number of benefit claimants here is 50% higher than in Great  Britain and is higher in every benefit type. As we know, the economic  inactivity rate in Northern Ireland is in and around 28%, which is the highest  of all the 12 UK regions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Much of our dependency is generationally ingrained. About  40% of our unemployed are long-term unemployed, and over half of our income  support claimants have been claiming that benefit for five years or more. We  are also afflicted at another level because our average income poverty rates  are higher than anywhere else in the United Kingdom. That fact has been acknowledged  by the new Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, Iain Duncan Smith, in his  foreword to a report entitled &lsquo;State of the Nation Report: Poverty,  Worklessness and Welfare Dependency in the UK&rsquo;, which looks at poverty and  worklessness across the United Kingdom.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Given that backcloth, it is entirely understandable that  there is a lot of fear and trepidation and a severe sense of unease across  Northern Ireland about what the latest round of welfare reforms might bring. I  could be cynical and say that I have heard every Government at Westminster in  my lifetime talk about how they will get stuck into welfare and slash welfare  bills yet the graph has gone up. However, I think that the new Administration  have a different intent.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We all know that the origin of the impending changes comes  from the coalition Government, and, to give a bit of context, we can all recall  how, in the election campaign, the new Prime Minister, David Cameron, singled  out Northern Ireland and lambasted and bemoaned us for our high level of public  spending. Subsequently, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, has  talked about making crude &pound;4 billion cuts to the overall welfare bill.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">If we were to get our percentage of that, as I fear might  happen, there would be a reduction of &pound;100 million to Northern Ireland. That is  a sizeable amount, equivalent to the budget of some of our Departments.  Clearly, when the welfare reforms that Iain Duncan Smith proposes are viewed in  the context of what the Prime Minister has done in singling out Northern  Ireland as a special case and what the Chancellor has said about crude &pound;4  billion cuts to the welfare bill, there is a great deal of unease and feeling  of dread for many people.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Before discussing my specific concerns, I want to make two  things perfectly clear. First, I do not fear reform. In fact, I welcome it. I  welcome reform when it is targeted at getting those who are able to work back  into work, and I welcome reform when it seeks to break the benefits trap that  has ensnared so many in our society. I welcome reform when it is targeted at  simplifying a system that, for many, including many Members, can, at times, be  impenetrable.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not welcome reform that, far from aiding the most  vulnerable in society, can afflict them the most. I do not welcome Northern  Ireland&rsquo;s being given its share of &pound;4 billion of social security cuts in some  sort of arbitrary and crude way regardless of the circumstances of Northern  Ireland or the consequences that it might have for our people.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is undeniably the case that Northern Ireland has more  than its fair share of problems with generational unemployment, economic  inactivity and a sense of hopelessness among many. I warmly welcome any reforms  that are targeted at helping those who can work to break those shackles of  despair that they have been bound in for, perhaps in some cases, generations.  Employment can find a way out of poverty, and everybody will acknowledge that  the best path out of poverty is a good, well-paying job.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Breaking the benefits trap should be the focus and first  objective of any welfare reform, and, in many cases, that is as much about  recognising the need to ease people back into work as it is about making the  system much more simple and straightforward. In that respect, there are  intriguing elements of the consultation document, &lsquo;21st Century Welfare&rsquo;, which  has been put out by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP).</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Welfare is not something that should be a lifestyle choice;  the social security system ought to be a safety net, not a comfy sofa for  someone to laze around on. It is there to help people who find themselves out  of work, to help people get back into work and to help those who are on low  incomes and those who are ill and chronically ill. It is not there as a  lifestyle choice for someone to live on forever and a day. Therefore, anything  that tackles generational underachievement or hopelessness and despair and  which gets people back into work should be acknowledged and welcomed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, in the context of all welfare reform, I place on  the record my personal and my party&rsquo;s commitment to the maintenance of the  parity principle when it comes to social security. Although there is scope for  Northern Ireland&rsquo;s special circumstances to be taken into account by DWP in  ways that it has been in the past, I do not want to see any opting out or any  derogations for Northern Ireland that would put parity and the comfort and  security that comes with it broken or put at risk in any way. That is a no-no.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Bit by bit, we are gaining something of an insight into  what DWP or, more pertinently, the Treasury might have in store for all of us.  As I said, DWP has a consultation out, and it will take some time to see  exactly what the conclusions of that will be. That is something for another  day; I am more concerned about some of the immediate cuts that might happen,  including the &pound;4 billion that could quite crudely be applied to Northern  Ireland and the other regions and the disproportionate effect that that might  have on Northern Ireland. From listening to some of the Minister&rsquo;s media  comments, I know that he is well aware of some of the rumours. Medical  assessment for all claimants of disability living allowance (DLA) has been  mentioned.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">If we set aside the cost implications for the  Northern Ireland Budget, have Northern Ireland&rsquo;s special circumstances, the  legacy of the Troubles and the impact that that has had on mental and physical  well-being been assessed or taken into consideration by the Treasury or by DWP?  We hear about cuts to the winter fuel allowance. How on earth will that help us  in Northern Ireland to fight fuel poverty and get people out of their desperate  situations, given our chronic levels of fuel poverty? That is the more  immediate concern on which we should focus.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The motion calls on the Assembly to empower the Minister  for Social Development to resist, on the one hand, welfare reforms that would  have a disproportionately negative effect on Northern Ireland by stressing our  special social and economic circumstances, while, on the other hand, seeking  the introduction of appropriate measures. I already made my point about  breaking with parity, and I hold fast to that. However, surely there is scope,  as there was in the past, for Northern Ireland&rsquo;s special circumstances. I am  talking about our high level of dependency on social security, our reliance on  the public sector and our position in the economic cycle as being the only  region in the UK that is still in recession and for those to be given some  weight when welfare reform is being implemented.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Consideration should also be given to how any reform system  is administered in Northern Ireland. Consideration should be given to childcare  concerns, for example, which are not the same as they are across the water; for  the running of proper and appropriate pilot schemes in Northern Ireland to find  out how some of the reforms would impact here; and for the pertinent situation  in which we spend our Budget on the administration of all those reforms but the  entire savings go back to Westminster. What amount, if any, can be kept and  what incentive can be given for us to keep that money.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Our first argument must be to resist the changes that have  a disproportionately negative effect on Northern Ireland. The impact of what  the coalition Government may bring forward could be devastating for Northern  Ireland if it is done in the crude, arbitrary way in which I fear that it  might, where we get our fair share or our percentage cut of &pound;4 billion of  reductions in the overall welfare bill.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: Will the Member bring his remarks to a close?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Hamilton</strong>:  With that in mind, we should empower our Minister to do what he has already  done and will continue to do and give him the full backing of the Assembly to  fight the case for Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Brady</strong>: Go  raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. The motion calls for support for  reforms that are, apparently:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;aimed at simplifying the social security process and  helping people to get back to work; and calls on the Minister for Social  Development to continue his dialogue with the Department for Work and Pensions,  stressing the need for the special social and economic circumstances &hellip; to be  carefully considered and urging &hellip; that the proposed welfare reforms do not have  a disproportionately negative impact&rdquo;.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Those statements and sentiments are laudable, but the  reality is that we are talking about parity legislation in relation to social  security. The Minister assured us that he will attempt to stretch the  flexibility of parity to its limit. However, we are not sure what that means  and what it will entail. For example, Simon Hamilton said that pilot schemes  would be run in Britain but not run here, which negates the idea of parity  immediately. Is the Minister really capable of making a silk purse out of a  sow&rsquo;s ear? I am sure that he will expand on that later.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Welfare Reform Bill is the biggest change to the  benefit system since its inception in 1948, and some might consider it to be a  major step towards dismantling the welfare state. The legislation will have  far-reaching consequences for many of those in receipt of social security  benefits. Those most affected will be vulnerable groups such as lone parents,  people suffering from mental illness, autism and those with learning  difficulties, those caring for an ageing relative and someone suffering from a  range of disabilities.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is certainly praiseworthy that people should be  encouraged back into employment. However, there is a presumption in the intent  of the Welfare Reform Bill that those who are economically inactive and in  receipt of benefit are quite content to remain unemployed, and it does not take  into account the many and varied reasons why people find themselves in that  situation. Rather than simplifying the system, the thrust of the Bill is  sanction-led and has more to do with penalising those on benefits than  developing a system that promotes and encourages people back into employment.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have been dealing with the social security system for  over 30 years, and I have rarely, if ever, come across anyone who wanted to be  on benefits or was content to be so. For many it is simply not a lifestyle  choice. It should also be remembered that the legislation is being introduced  at a time of severe economic restraint and recession when any kind of  meaningful employment is almost impossible to find.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Lone parents are one group that will be most affected by  the changes. The changes will also have an adverse effect on their children.  The age range of dependent children, which determines whether a lone parent is  expected to seek employment, will continue to decrease, and that will seriously  impact on the level of care that a parent can give to his or her children. The  level of childcare provision here in the North is also woefully inadequate,  and, until proper provision is put in place, the children who are affected by  the legislation will continue to have difficultly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Unfortunately, parity legislation for social security  continues to be the accepted norm. Sinn F&eacute;in attempted to introduce a number of  reasonable amendments to the Welfare Reform Bill, but those were not accepted.  If we cannot change parity legislation, we should ensure that it is properly  administered to ensure that those who need and require benefits receive them in  a reasonable time from the date of claim and do not have to wait for a number  of weeks. That is happening at the moment, and it is putting people, many of  whom have worked for many years and who have not made the lifestyle choice to  be on benefits, into penury and hardship.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We must continue to monitor carefully the legislation,  which is becoming more complex rather than simpler. Almost all the leading  voluntary organisations that gave evidence to the Social Development Committee  on the Bill voiced some serious opposition. The motion must be considered in  the overall context of the Welfare Reform Bill, which many, including myself,  think is not beneficial.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mrs M Bradley</strong>:  I am under no illusions that there are serious difficulties ahead for us all in  the near future, but particularly for those who are the most vulnerable and who  totally rely on benefits. There is an air of foreboding when we speak of the  forthcoming welfare reform, but I am confident that the Minister will fight  Northern Ireland&rsquo;s case as an exceptional one. Our long troubled history,  coupled with our poor economic recovery rate paints a dire picture.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The many contributors to the debate have robustly stated  their concerns and will continue to do so. I have no intention of reiterating  those issues, but it is worth overstating some points. I am sure that all  Members could recount the ever-increasing numbers of people who come through  their constituency offices with similar complaints about their housing benefit  and the removal of DLA from genuine recipients. The lack of childcare adds to  the problems for lone parents and the parents of younger children.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Given the proposed cuts to the welfare system, it would be  foolhardy of any of us to presume that Northern Ireland will be insulated  against the anticipated effect, and, ultimately, benefit allocations must be  curbed. However, we must also be careful that we do not marginalise or punish  the genuine cases who cannot survive without the state&rsquo;s help.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister has voiced on record his concerns about how  the fallout of the emergency Budget will affect Northern Ireland&rsquo;s welfare  system. The Minister has voiced and will continue to voice those concerns to  Iain Duncan Smith and to Lord Freud.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Due to the economic situation and the resulting continuous  fallout, we must be mindful of those who are classed as the working poor and  who are struggling to make ends meet because they work. I represent an area in  Foyle that is classed as one of the highest-ranking areas of deprivation in  Northern Ireland and which, as a result, has one of the highest rankings for  benefit dependency. I am also mindful of those who are perceived to be lucky  enough to have a job, but who are teetering on the edge of financial ruin  simply because they work. Those families are continuously overlooked in the  British Government&rsquo;s plans and receive no financial help or assistance. Unlike  the bankers, they cannot depend on generous bonuses to help them to pay their  bills, and, unlike the bankers, they did not contribute to the situation that  they find themselves in.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also have grave concerns for those who, as a result of  welfare reform, will be moved from income support to jobseekers allowance.  Foyle has already haemorrhaged thousands of jobs and continues to do so, and I  am unsure where those affected will find jobs. However, that question is for  another Minister on another day.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I ask the Minister to continue with his endeavours to state  the case for Northern Ireland. I have full confidence that he will do that and  that he will deliver a fair and appropriate system of welfare reform that  considers all our people and all our unique difficulties, which cannot be swept  under the carpet. I support the motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms Lo</strong>: I  thank the Members who brought forward the motion. It is very timely, given that  the Minister is having conversations with his counterpart in DWP. I assure the  Minister that the Alliance Party supports his efforts to minimise the negative  impact that welfare reform may have on Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although I support the principles of welfare reform, during  the passage of the Welfare Reform Bill, I expressed a number of concerns that  reform proposals may push those who are already marginalised further into the  margins of society. Due to our specific social and economic circumstances,  Northern Ireland has a high dependency on social security benefits. We are a  post-conflict region that is still suffering from the legacy of a higher  prevalence of mental and physical health problems. The costs of division and  segregation are estimated to be &pound;1&middot;5 billion a year. We have the lowest average  income in the entire UK. The proportion of people in Northern Ireland who are  not in paid work is higher than in the rest of the UK. During the recession,  that proportion has risen further and faster than in any other region. Compared  with the rest of the UK, our recovery from recession is expected to be slower.  Around 20% of people in Northern Ireland live in low income households.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Simplifying the social security process is, of course,  important, and it would make it easier for people to access their benefits and  understand what they are entitled to. However, any change to the system must be  properly planned and considered, and it must be implemented effectively. The  employment and support allowance (ESA) system has not worked smoothly. I have a  constituent who had repeated problems with original documents being lost and  who had to wait four months before receiving any payment. That is just one  example of many. Effective communications between the different agencies that  deal with social security benefits is also essential, but we are not seeing  that as a matter of course.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although we acknowledge the serious consequences of  breaching parity, there has to be flexibility in the system so that our  particular needs can be recognised. Reform is necessary if we are to break the  habit of welfare dependency and if we are to support those who can work to get  back into the workplace. However, reforms must be backed up by strategies that  support those who will be affected.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We still have no strategy on childcare or early years. One  in five households in Northern Ireland is a single parent family, and lone  parents cannot simply return to work. They need measures to address the lack of  nursery provision and affordable childcare, the cost of which is one of the  main issues preventing parents returning to work, especially as three in four  single parent families in Northern Ireland live in poverty. It is important  that we recognise that parents who make the choice to stay at home with their  children are also making a contribution to society. Surely, therefore, they are  entitled to benefits to enable them to do that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As Mickey said, the majority of people want to work if they  are able to get a decent job. It is important, therefore, that we help those  people get enough qualifications to help them to get a decently paid job so  that the pay makes it worth their while to go out to work rather than be  dependent on social security.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Easton</strong>: I  thank my two colleagues for bringing the motion before the House. I am deeply  concerned for many of my constituents in North Down who are in receipt of  social welfare benefits. I deal, daily, with people who are unable to work for  medical reasons; people who want to work but are unable to find jobs; single  parents who struggle to make ends meet; and, especially, those who find it  difficult to fill out benefits application forms, which, in my experience, are  incredibly difficult and deliberately cumbersome.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We, in Northern Ireland, have a special case. The number of  families with children in receipt of benefits totals 119,000. To put that into  perspective, 68% of claimants have children and have been in receipt of  benefits for the last two years; that is a worrying statistic. We must work  with the Minister for Work and Pensions to protect the people of Northern  Ireland who are reliant on benefits for good reasons. It is important that we  see that the commitment of the coalition Government to simplify the benefits  system comes to fruition. The system is complicated, even for those who have  been in it for a long time. It changes constantly, and it becomes more  complicated every time that it is changed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As of November 2009, 21% of our working age population was  claiming a key benefit. I have no doubt that that figure will rise as, in the  recession, many people are laid off and those on unemployment benefit are  unable to find work in the competitive job market. I and my constituents are  very worried about the soundings from Westminster about cutting welfare  benefits by &pound;4 billion. When times are tight and our nation faces a huge  deficit, which is what the coalition is trying to reduce, people become more  reliant on benefits. People lose jobs and require help from the state during  any recession. Any benefits cuts must bear that in mind. It has always been the  philosophy of our nation to help those in most need. Jobs are hard to come by,  and those who apply for positions face considerable competition, which reduces  their chances of success.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The special circumstances of Northern Ireland have been  highlighted by the Minister for Work and Pensions in the report that was  commissioned by his party and published by the Centre for Social Justice. It  identifies a range of deep social issues in Northern Ireland that have been  made more difficult by the legacy of conflict. I know of many people on  benefits who served in the security forces. They suffer from physical and  mental illness as a result of having worked to defend democracy and secure  peace. We must not forget those people now that we are in a period of peace; we  must provide for them. Others who served our Province lost their lives, and we  must remember the families that they left behind.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am passionate about this issue. I entered politics to  make people&rsquo;s lives better, and I want us, as an Assembly, to achieve that. I,  therefore, support the motion wholeheartedly and urge other Members to do the  same.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms M Anderson</strong>:  Go raibh m&iacute;le maith agat. &Eacute;ir&iacute;m chun taca&iacute;ocht a thabhairt don r&uacute;n. I support  the motion, particularly its reference to the high dependency on social  benefit. As some Members have outlined, there are undoubtedly elements of  welfare reform that have potential. The removal of benefit complexity, for  example, can only be a good thing for many of the people whom we represent. However,  there are areas about which Sinn F&eacute;in representatives have consistently raised  concern, particularly the use of sanctions such as the removal of benefits for  the most trivial of reasons.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Many in the Chamber will be aware of people who, for a  whole host of reasons, were not able to turn up for an interview and, as a  result, had their benefits suspended for anything from one to eight weeks.  During such suspensions, I know that a number of people have to rely on  families and friends simply to survive. There is clearly something wrong with a  system that allows people to be forced into such untenable situations.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The benefits system should not be about looking at ways of  stopping the benefits of people who claim entitlements. It should be about  ensuring that people who need help can avail themselves of it without being  stigmatised or criminalised. Furthermore, the aim of welfare reform is clearly  to have one universal benefit system. I have concerns about that; it could lead  to more centralisation and a dilution of front line services, and it will  inevitably lead to job losses in social security agency offices, perhaps in  places such as Derry.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Having said that, I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s comments  earlier this month following a meeting with the British Tory Minister Iain  Duncan Smith, when he insisted that welfare reform should not be used as a  means to attack people on benefits and to load the burden of Tory Budget cuts  on to the most vulnerable people in our society. Those are very welcome words  indeed, but we need to see more action rather than relying on the goodwill of  the Tory Minister in London. The Minister and, most importantly, the people  whom we all represent would be much better served by working towards breaking  parity with Britain. We would all do much better and would be much better  served by taking control of our financial destiny and of our benefits system so  that we can shape the kind of reform that is needed for the people whom we  represent here in the North.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.30 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister rightly made the point that there are unique  circumstances in the North of Ireland, such as the high level of deprivation  and the legacy of the conflict. Mary Bradley spoke about the higher levels of  deprivation in places such as north and west Belfast and Derry, and we all represent  constituencies in those places. Therefore, it makes sense to have a benefits  system that is designed to meet the needs of this region rather than one that  is conceived for and largely administered from England.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We may be tied to parity, but we should not be in any rush  to implement many elements of the legislation. Clearly, the benefits system  here needs reforming. Without doubt, there are many problems that I am sure all  representatives are dealing with in their constituency, sometimes on a daily  basis. However, a read-across Bill from Britain that we have been asked to  implement in the North is not the answer. We need our own Bill, and we need our  own system &mdash; I am relating particularly to the text of the motion &mdash; which needs  to be designed to meet the needs of the people whom we represent.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Although I welcome the sentiments of the motion and support  it on that basis, it does not go far enough as far as Sinn F&eacute;in and I are  concerned. I would like to see the Minister doing much more than simply continuing  his dialogue with his British counterparts. I would like to see him taking  control of our destiny. The only cuts that he should be implementing are those  that sever the apron strings from Britain.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Craig</strong>: I  welcome the opportunity to speak to the motion. It is genuinely worrying to see  how many people depend on social security benefits and, primarily, on  jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance. In the past two years in my constituency in Lagan  Valley, the figure has risen from 900 to more than 2,000, which is a clear  indicator of how the economy in Northern Ireland is performing. It is also  worrying that roughly 10% of the population are in receipt of disability living  allowance. A large percentage of those people receive both care and mobility  components. Eight per cent of our population are in receipt of housing benefit,  and the majority of claimants live in the private rented sector and not in  social housing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">That said, I see that the Tories are planning to introduce  severe cuts to the whole welfare system. As someone who was looking for  employment in the 1980s, I can say that I am not surprised by that. There was a  period of deep recession then; in fact, if I were honest about it, it was  almost deeper than the current recession in some respects. At that time, there  was a Tory Government, and their response to the recession was not really a  jobs creation Budget but rather a severe attack on the welfare system.  Therefore, I stand here as someone who has learnt from that period of history,  and I am not surprised that it is repeating itself with yet another Tory  Government. It will have catastrophic effects for people who are in receipt of  benefits and rely on them.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Whether we like it or not, Northern Ireland has a special  case to make. I was interested to hear the Minister talk about his meeting with  Iain Duncan Smith on the radio the other day. It is good that the Minister is  at least making an effort to uphold that special status. Northern Ireland has  endured a troubled period of more than 30 years. There has been conflict and  violence. There is no point in sticking our heads in the sand and saying that  it did not occur. It did occur. It had severe economic repercussions for all of  Northern Ireland. It is only right that that be taken into account, as well as  the effects of the UK Government&rsquo;s reduction of certain benefits and the  implications that that would have for the entire social justice system in  Northern Ireland.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I fully accept that there are issues and problems with the  welfare system. I am not against welfare reform. In fact, if anything, I would  say that certain aspects of the welfare system almost need to be scrapped and  started over again. When I look at the 84-page document that needs to be filled  in for DLA, I believe that not only have we created a welfare nightmare for the  Government, but we have gone one step further and created a system to support  applicants to the welfare system. Strangely enough, as taxpayers, we pay not  only for the DLA system but for the support system that aids people to apply  for that benefit in the first place. That is a ludicrous situation for any  country to have got itself into. Unfortunately, that is where we are in the UK  welfare system. Elements of that system need to be addressed. However, they  need to be looked at in a sensible and sensitive manner by the Government. Will  that happen? Have I any faith in a Tory Government to deliver sensible reforms  to the welfare system? I stand here as someone who experienced the recession of  the 1980s. I am sorry, but my experience tells me that that will not happen. It  is up to the Assembly to voice its strong objection to the ludicrous  suggestions that are coming forward, which will cost the block grant an  absolute fortune. We can be sure that the only beneficiary will be the Treasury  in London. I support the motion.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Gallagher</strong>:  At the outset, I want to thank the DUP Members who brought the motion on this  important issue to the Assembly. I also want to commend the Minister for his  initiative in going to London to try to persuade the UK Government of Northern  Ireland&rsquo;s particular problems. Most of us understand that he has a difficult  task in that regard, and we wish him well in it. Unlike Martina Anderson, those  of us who live in the real world realise that there are limitations to what he  can do. He certainly does not have a magic wand at his disposal.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The number of benefit claimants paints a good picture of  the grim situation that exists throughout Northern Ireland. There is a big  challenge in getting those people off benefits and back to work. The SDLP  believes that there should be no cutting of benefits. That clearly would not  work to change the situation for people who are caught in a cycle of poverty  and unemployment. We can look at other ways to break that cycle, such as  providing part-time work, and try to move to a situation in which people who  try to take employment, even on a part-time basis, are not caught up in a tax  net that makes the entire exercise pointless. We also need to look at how we  can arrive at a situation in which those people can do a bit of work but have  their benefit entitlement protected.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We need to look at other areas that relate to work  capability assessments. That is particularly important with DLA, but it is also  essential with ESA. Mickey Brady highlighted the delays in the payment of  benefits here. Indeed, many households here find themselves in the very worrying  situation of having no bread on the table.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The capability assessment element of ESA needs to be looked  at. In the area in which I live, I find that claimants send in their claim with  certificates signed by their doctor stating that the claimant should be off  work for three months and, in some cases, four months. However, within the same  system, another assessor may say that the claimant is not entitled to the  benefit in question. There is something badly wrong there, and we need to look  at that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">A Member on the opposite Benches mentioned a problem  relating to a childcare strategy. It is clear that we will not attract people  back into work and encourage them to leave the benefits system unless they have  affordable childcare. OFMDFM has a clear role in dealing with that problem  through its strategy on childcare. However, we have not seen any action on  that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">All those initiatives need to be backed up by the necessary  funding. The Minister has been in London talking about the importance of making  that funding available. However, there is also a responsibility on the  Executive, through their arrangements, to be aware of the people who are on  benefits. After all, those people are on benefits through no fault of their  own. They are on benefits because of the actions of a small number of reckless,  greedy and irresponsible people who brought about the financial crisis that we  are in. We do not want the people who had nothing to do with that and who are  suffering the most to be left without any support.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I also support the motion, and I  commend the DUP for tabling it. However, when Simon Hamilton mentioned Varney  in his introduction, I had to shudder. He knows my party&rsquo;s view on Varney. It  reminded me of a discussion that we once had in the Health Committee about John  Appleby, who is another economist and one who never appreciated the differences  and distinctions in the North when it came to poverty, ill health, inequality  and the legacy of the conflict that it has come through. There was a notion  that something that operates in an area such as Bradford in England, which has  similar issues, can be transported here and that it will work. It will not  work. It has not worked in the past, and it will not work now.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Our party&rsquo;s views on welfare reform are on record. We  tabled amendments to the Welfare Reform Bill, which was before the House in  June. Our amendments were unsuccessful, but, at that time, the Minister  acknowledged that they were not mischievous but could have a mischievous effect  so far as parity is concerned.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Setting political differences aside, this is the first  debate that we have had in a long time where practically everyone is saying the  same thing. That is to be welcomed. People are arguing that there is a special  case here when it comes to dealing with welfare reform. Like other Members who  have spoken, I do not always think about cuts whenever I hear the word  &ldquo;reform&rdquo;. However, that is exactly what welfare reform from a Tory Government  will mean. Is there room to make efficiencies? Is there room to do things  better? There is, but it is up to us to decide what efficiencies need to be  made and what room there is for doing things better. It has to be down to us  and our local experience. That is where the whole system will be turning on its  head.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">4.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister said in June that he would try to stretch  parity to its limits. I would like to see some proposals, if he can share them  with us, because it is important to get cross-party support. I was encouraged  by the responses to Iain Duncan Smith&rsquo;s vision of social justice; it is not the  sort of social justice that we need. Jonathan Craig, Mickey Brady and others  mentioned DLA, which has the lowest percentage of fraud of any benefit here. It  is for people who are sick, needy, vulnerable and disabled, and that is what we  are talking about cutting. Those are the people who will be directly affected  by any change or cut in the welfare system.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Winter fuel payments were also mentioned. It is vital that  we take a cross-party message to the British Treasury that we cannot support  the proposed welfare reforms; but what does it mean? I have no doubt that the  Minister will say that he is hamstrung by parity, yet DLA forms were &mdash; still  are &mdash; notoriously long, but we had the ability locally to administer the  benefit and change the forms. Without sounding naive, I suggest that, if a  certain percentage comes out of the block grant for people who are unemployed,  sick or cannot work, it is up to us to administer that locally, but that  absolutely does not mean administer cuts. If anything, because of the economic  situation, people will be more reliant on the welfare system.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Tommy Gallagher mentioned the childcare strategy. That was  the point that we made in our proposed amendments to the Welfare Reform Bill,  which, unfortunately, his party failed to acknowledge. It is all very well  politicking now, but that is a fact. His party also attempted to block the  Financial Assistance Bill, now the Financial Assistance Act 2009, because of  the very issue that we raised. We made the point about lone parents, welfare  reform and people going back to work with no childcare. Whoever has  responsibility &mdash; the First Minister and deputy First Minister or someone else &mdash;  it needs to be sorted out because it prevents people from going to work. I want  to put that on the record.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I support the motion and think that we have had a good  debate, although it is not over yet. I will listen to the Minister, but we need  to come back to the issue, and, if that means an all-party group or an  all-party meeting on it, I am offering our support in taking those discussions  forward.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr S Anderson</strong>:  In supporting the motion, I commend my colleagues Simon Hamilton and Michelle  McIlveen for tabling it. It was only a short while ago that the then leader of  the opposition, now Prime Minister, David Cameron, singled Northern Ireland out  as top of his hit list for cuts. Indeed, there are Members in the House who  spoke in his defence at that time. They also actively campaigned in support of  those cuts and sought election in May on the basis of being inextricably linked  to him. Indeed, had they been elected they would have been at Westminster  championing those cuts.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is estimated that, when the cuts are implemented, they  could be up to the tune of &pound;2 billion. That being so, the motion is timely and  raises important matters that deserve close attention. The first thing that  needs to be admitted on all sides is that Northern Ireland has a high  dependency on benefits. Most people acknowledge that, but there are some  factors that we need to keep in mind. We need to consider, for instance, the  fact that no other part of the United Kingdom has such a high proportion of its  population who will carry with them for the rest of their life the physical and  mental scars inflicted on them over several decades of cruel terrorist attacks.  That is just one factor, but it is a very important one.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I said, most people acknowledge that there is a high  dependency on benefits in Northern Ireland. Therefore, it is only right that we  consider ways to help people back to work. That should be our goal. However, it  depends on the existence of jobs that people can apply for. Northern Ireland is  at a different place in the economic cycle from the rest of the United Kingdom,  and it will, therefore, take us longer to emerge from the recession. It needs  to be remembered that the very cuts agenda advanced by David Cameron and, as I  said, supported by some Members of this Chamber will, in all likelihood, mean  that more jobs will be removed from the marketplace here than elsewhere in the  United Kingdom, proportionally, because of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s high level of  public sector employment. Those factors must be taken into account seriously.  We cannot run away from them. However, as we take those factors into account,  we should also seek to assist as many people as possible out of benefits and  into work. Everyone deserves the right to have a job, and we should do  everything that we can to help them to achieve that. I echo the motion in  calling for the Minister, in his discussions with the Department for Work and  Pensions, to continue to stress the particular economic circumstances that  pertain to Northern Ireland, while seeking to reform the benefits system and  help get people back into employment.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr G Robinson</strong>:  I thank my two colleagues for bringing this motion to the Chamber. As the motion  states, far too many residents in Northern Ireland, through no fault of their  own, depend heavily on social security benefits. Although that is a sad fact of  life, I have found that the complicated benefits system has been, at times, a  barrier to people claiming the much-needed benefits to which they are entitled.  The motion calls for a simplified system to be introduced. That would prevent  people from losing out on their entitlements and would ensure that they are  given as much help as possible, including retraining to get them back into the  workforce, which would be a positive step.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Department for Work and Pensions must be made fully  aware of the implications for Northern Ireland should it make changes that have  a disproportionate impact here. Given that Northern Ireland has a large public  sector and a higher number of benefit-dependent households, any changes made  would have a greater impact here, if the end result is that the Minister cannot  secure acknowledgement of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s special circumstances. There have  been business closures and job losses in every constituency throughout Northern  Ireland, and it will take time to build up employment again in the current  economic downturn. To ensure that that happens, we need the DWP to take appropriate  measures to ensure that all families are protected as much as possible from the  forthcoming cuts.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We have a willing and hard-working workforce in Northern  Ireland, and people are prepared to retrain or re-enter education to ensure  that they get employment when the economy picks up. However, it is essential  that the support that enables them to do so is maintained. That must be a  central part of our plan for the future. I am happy to support this worthwhile  motion and hope that all Members of the Assembly do the same given these dire  economic times.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Armstrong</strong>:  The Ulster Unionist Party and Assembly Members at large acknowledge Northern  Ireland&rsquo;s high dependency on social security benefits and support the reforms.  However, I am somewhat concerned that the Members who tabled the motion are in  two minds. In many ways, the motion appears to be a hokey-cokey approach to  welfare reform.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In Northern Ireland, we have entrenched patterns of  worklessness and child poverty that undermine prosperity and opportunity for  too many people. There is nothing compassionate about a welfare system that  removes the initiative to work. A recent Centre for Social Justice report  highlighted the numerous problems that we face. For example, Northern Ireland  has the highest economic inactivity in the United Kingdom. Over half of the  people who claim income support have done so for more than five years, and  long-term unemployment is estimated at 40% of total unemployment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We now have a welfare system that is extremely complicated  and discourages people from getting back to work. People, including parents,  are often better off staying on benefits than finding a job. In such  circumstances, it is understandable that they do not seek work. If we are to  have a more socially mobile society and if we are to break long-term cycles of  poverty, we must make work pay and the welfare system simpler. Those who  advocate the status quo appear to be prepared to abandon too many citizens to  welfare dependency and worklessness.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Ulster Unionist Party is primarily a pragmatic party.  Welfare reform must work in tandem with the revitalisation of the economy. It  must work alongside early intervention, an improved education system and  reformed childcare. That is why, as we face the inevitable spending cuts that  are coming from the comprehensive spending review, we must be in a position to  improve what we do locally, as well as ensuring that Westminster offers us  proportionate protection. The UK coalition Government must bring forward  proposals for economic reform in Northern Ireland as soon as possible. Giving  people incentives to work will be successful only if jobs are available. We  also need to ensure that people have the necessary skills to gain long-term  employment.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Ulster Unionist Party wants to ensure that Northern  Ireland is not disproportionately affected by welfare reforms. However, there  has to be an element of reality to this debate. The parity principle, which we  support, dictates that the Minister for Social Development will implement the reforms  introduced from Westminster or face potentially significant financial  consequences.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Yesterday, I noticed that Sinn F&eacute;in called for the Social  Development Minister to cut the apron strings from Westminster. Bearing in mind  the amount of money that Westminster provides to the local welfare budget, I  have to say that it is not the apron strings that we would be cutting but the  benefit cheques. Westminster is the key to welfare and welfare reform.  Therefore, I hope that the DUP, in particular, will be raising the issue in  Westminster and that today is not merely a grandstanding operation.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Irwin</strong>: I  welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the motion tabled by my  colleagues. The motion is clear on one fact, which is that Northern Ireland is  highly reliant on social security benefits. Part of my role as an elected  representative involves assisting in benefits issues and charting a course  through the benefits process for my constituents.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are many people out there who are disabled or unwell  due to a number of conditions and are certainly unfit for work. In my opinion,  it is important for the Minister to stress to that group that their rights to  benefits will be protected. There is a lot of uncertainty among people who are  on disability benefits, and I have spoken to a number who are worried that  their benefits will be drastically cut or, worse still, removed. The Minister  must reassure those people that DSD is not on a crusade to slash benefits and  leave people who are genuinely unable to work without the means to have a  reasonable standard of living.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Of course, in any society, there are those who are cheating  the system and are in receipt of benefits where no benefit is deserved. Those  people could be deemed to be eligible for some type of employment. In that  light, therefore, our benefits system requires reform in order to ensure that  the money is going to those who need it most.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">With regard to my experiences with the Social Security  Agency, I believe that there must also be a review of how certain benefits are  administered, particularly employment and support allowance. I have had  worrying cases where constituents were without any form of income due to issues  with the processing of their particular benefit. On one occasion, the applicant  sent important information by recorded delivery; yet, somehow, it was lost by  the agency, and that added many weeks to the application process. I would like  the Minister to explain how such important and confidential information is  mislaid and to tell us whether he is concerned about such a loss.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I also have a problem with the length of time that the  disability living allowance appeals process takes. Applicants may have to wait  many weeks for an appeal hearing date. My constituents are particularly  concerned about all those issues, against a backdrop of coalition cuts and a  drive to reduce the number of people on benefits.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">5.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I understand the economics of DWP&rsquo;s desire to reduce the  social security bill. However, we must be very careful not to pile more  disadvantages on those who, through illness, are already at a disadvantage in  not being fit or able to work. Steps could be taken to encourage more people  off benefits and into work. However, in tandem, we must realise that Northern  Ireland has come through a rough and troublesome past whose legacy has affected  a number of people and families to a higher degree than in any other part of  the United Kingdom.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I wish the Minister well in his challenge in dealing with  the Department for Work and Pensions and I hope that there will be recognition  of our unique circumstances.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr McHugh</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I did not expect to take part in  the debate because of the long list of people who were due to speak before me.  I agree with the motion, and it is good to see it coming from the DUP. It is  good to see that we have moved on, and that the attacks by the Conservative  Government on the weak and vulnerable are no longer supported by people in this  Chamber.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister has a big job in trying to challenge the cuts.  However, the noises here are about working within the cuts, rather than  challenging them. It is almost as if we have taken a 10- or 20-year leap from  the conflict to where we are now. We have a special case here, and will for  quite some time, in respect of our financial situation as a result of the  legacy of the conflict. That legacy has many aspects, and it will take at least  30 years to overcome.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The benefit support system has become ingrained and  entrenched in particular areas. Billy made conflicting arguments about that,  and why people should be forced back to work, which the Conservatives pretend  is their mantra. However, we cannot force people back to work if there are no  jobs. There are no jobs in Ireland, north, south, east or west, for those who  are well capable of doing them. There was pressure even on those who were  unable to go to work to do some sort of job. There are no jobs for anyone at  the moment, and that has to be taken into account.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We had a debate earlier about equality. That plays a part,  because there is a legacy of inequality between the west and the east, by which  I mean Belfast. There was always inequality in where jobs were placed, and that  still goes on. People from Fermanagh and South Tyrone, even recent graduates,  still have to go in this direction or further afield if they want to take up  employment in their chosen career &mdash; or they have to leave the country  altogether. That has gone on for decades.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We talk about the financial situation here almost as if it  was something that happened in the North. A lot of our difficulties with the  British Government originated over there as a result of their financial  dealings and failings. That has not been taken into account, and they have  managed to escape that issue very well, including at the last election. Those  who voted for them now face the cuts as well, so there is certainly something  amiss with the people over there who voted them into power, knowing that this  was coming down the pipe.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">So-called progressive reform of the welfare system over the  years has made things much worse for the weak and vulnerable, every time.  Applying for their benefits was made more difficult and they were cut back  more. I know from my own office staff, who do a professional job in filling in  forms and dealing with people&rsquo;s difficulties every day, that it is very  difficult to get disability living allowance or any other benefit. As someone  mentioned, there has to be a cost to delivering that. So, we are paying for it  from several directions.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">People are very fearful; they fear for their pensions and  for their futures, and they have to depend on welfare. In the South, a single  person receives &euro;200 a week in unemployment benefit; here, it is &pound;60 or less.  There is a great disparity there. At least the South is willing to recognise  that people need a certain amount of money to live on. There are people who  have to survive on &pound;60 a week, which has to be taken into account.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">To the Minister, I say that, although there is a conflict  here about how to approach the financial situation, Sinn F&eacute;in is probably  taking the right approach by challenging the cuts and trying to negotiate them.  That is important because young people will increasingly get into drugs or  violence or become dissidents &mdash; or whatever people want to call it &mdash; if  deprivation in their areas is not addressed.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development &nbsp;(Mr Attwood)</strong>: I  thank everybody for their broad and particular endorsements. One Member said  that he would be nice and encouraging; another said that there would be welcome  words; another said that she had full confidence in me; and someone else said  practically the same. Although, in one way, that might cause us to suspend  disbelief, in another way, I welcome it, because, since I came into post in  May, I have had a very clear view of what is being proposed through welfare  reform.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Whether that reform comes in the form of the proposals for  2013 and beyond that will emerge over the next short period of time or whether  it comes in the form of the benefit cuts that have already been announced by  the Chancellor &mdash; with possibly more to come &mdash; I have no doubt that it will be  the most significant change to benefits for a generation or more. Mr Brady said  that the reforms were steps towards dismantling of the welfare state, and there  may be an element of truth in that. I spoke to a very senior Tory Minister  within the past couple of days. He said that the Tory coalition&rsquo;s proposals  would be its enduring legacy and would have the single biggest impact of any  decision made by the coalition Government in the lifetime of this Westminster  Parliament. That is the scale of what we are talking about. Therefore, I  welcome all input, because it scopes out the scale of what we are talking  about.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister for  Social Development</strong>: I will take the intervention shortly.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In dealing with the issue, I have been informed by four  principles. The first, which is shared across all parties and all Members, is  that, whatever welfare changes are proposed, our argument has to be about the  top line when it comes to the block grant and the bottom line when it comes to  how we spend the block grant and about protecting those in need, stress and  disadvantage and those who may be experiencing alienation. That has to be a  core value of government strategy and of the Budget negotiations in the Chamber  over the next short space of time.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Secondly, the Northern Ireland conditions have to be taken  fully into account. It is a fact that we have had to deal with  intergenerational disadvantage and poverty, higher levels of emigration, women  in their 40s bearing children, the legacy of long-term unemployment and  families with nobody &mdash; grandparent, parent or child &mdash; in work. All of that is  compounded by the legacy of conflict.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Thirdly, as Simon Hamilton, Mr McHugh and others mentioned,  in this part of these islands, we will be in recession at least until the end  of 2012 and possibly longer. I met the representatives from the Construction  Employers Federation two weeks ago, and one of its senior members believes that  we will be in recession after the end of 2012.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Imposing welfare proposals or arguing for welfare changes  in the absence of jobs is ludicrous. That is compounded by the fact that if  there are public sector cuts but no new private sector jobs, the employment  situation will deteriorate further.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The fourth element of my approach has been not just to  argue against the immediate welfare benefit changes and against the potential  changes over the next two or three years but to scope out all options for how  Northern Ireland can be different in its approach to welfare reform.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Brady said:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;If we cannot change parity legislation, we should  ensure that it is properly administered&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">I agree. If Members have issues with how social  security is managed on a case-by-case basis, they should bring them to my  attention and I will address them. I have made it clear, through the Social  Security Agency, that where things are not managed properly and people are  suffering delay in their benefit entitlement, we should address it, apologise  for it and correct it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, I go further than Mr Brady in managing parity  properly. My approach is to maximise flexibilities in and around parity and try  to identify opportunities to move beyond it. I am not prepared to compromise  the principle of parity per se, because, as I recall, a &pound;3 billion subvention  is paid to Northern Ireland annually in benefit payments. Therefore unless we  work through very carefully what it means to change, abandon or move away from  parity, we will only impose on those whom we are trying to protect greater  doubt and greater burden.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As I say, I go further than Mr Brady. I want to find out  where the operational flexibilities are, if possible develop pilots to see  where we can go beyond parity and, at the same time, negotiate to move beyond  parity in a way that does not have an adverse or disproportionate impact on the  people whom we are here to serve.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We can only judge the London Government by what they do as  opposed to what they say. The effects of the emergency Budget, according to the  Institute for Fiscal Studies, mean that those who are poor and disadvantaged  will suffer disproportionately. The BBC&rsquo;s research confirmed that the areas  with the highest level of public sector dependency will suffer most from the  budget proposals. The TUC said that its scoping out of benefit proposals and  London&rsquo;s policy suggests that the disadvantaged will suffer disproportionately.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Those are the hard facts and the brutal reality of what the  London Government have already decided. Therefore, I decided that we should not  enter into dialogue with Iain Duncan Smith and Lord Freud or the London  officials when it comes to welfare and benefits, but that we go into hard and  tough negotiations. Those negations are still at an early stage and are far  from concluded. We have had only three meetings and there is much more work to  do; however, I am determined that we will do it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I approach that work from the following perspective: I  agree with Simon Hamilton and Martina Anderson that there is a need for reform.  Northern Ireland does reform well. What has been achieved collectively, despite  resistance, on policing and politics, fair employment and housing, demonstrates  that in our culture we have the capacity to look at the need for reform, and,  whether we set about it with enthusiasm or reluctance, we set about it. There  is further need for reform in Northern Ireland of prisons, the Public  Prosecution Service and housing. I am not opposed to reform, but we have to  make a judgement about what the reforms mean to the individuals, families and  communities that we represent.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">5.15 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n asked precisely what measures I am looking  at. I will answer her question in part. I am not going to share all my thinking  because those matters are, in some ways, works in progress and are still part  of the conversation that I am having with Lord Freud. However, I will give some  indicative examples of what I told him yesterday. I told Lord Freud that the  proposal to cut housing benefit for people who had claimed jobseeker&rsquo;s  allowance for over one year would penalise people generally as well as those  who would like to find work but cannot because of the condition of the job  market in Northern Ireland. I told him that, due to the economic conditions  that prevail in Northern Ireland, we will be in recession until at least the  end of 2012, and so to penalise people still on JSA after one year by cutting  their housing benefit by 10% was a punitive and unjustified punishment. I asked  him to re-examine that.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I asked Lord Freud to extend the mortgage support scheme  introduced by the Labour Party in January 2009 beyond its end date of January  2011. That is because is seems to me that homeowners with heavy mortgages who  lost their jobs in communities throughout these islands through no fault of  their own as a result of the world recession needed continued mortgage support.  Therefore, the extension of that scheme beyond the two years is important.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There are proposals to change the regime around disability  living allowance, which could potentially occur before the current scheduled  date of 2013. Over 100,000 people in Northern Ireland are on disability living  allowance. I asked Lord Freud to take on board the profile of DLA claimants in  Northern Ireland, their number and the circumstances that they have lived in, not  least because of the legacy of conflict. I told him that I wanted our  officials, and right up to ministerial level, to work through how that change  would work in Northern Ireland to ensure that the blind pursuit of cutting  benefits and the blind ambition of getting people into work did not come back  in the face of those tens of thousands of people who, because of their mental  and physical condition, are not going to be fit for work now and in the future.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The social fund involves tens of millions of pounds a year  in payments to people for community grants, white goods or funeral payments. I  put it to Lord Freud that the proposals that have been outlined for England,  Scotland and Wales make no sense in a Northern Ireland context. They involve  giving responsibility for administering the payments to local authorities.  However, our local authorities are of a different nature to those across the  Irish Sea in Britain. We already have a localised system of payment of social  funds through eight major offices and 26 satellite offices. Therefore, it  seemed to me that that model of delivery of the social fund was fit for purpose  here, regardless of what might be proposed in England.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In answering Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n&rsquo;s question, I am trying to scope  out some of the scale of what we asked Lord Freud about yesterday. I am not  even going to outline some of the harder issues and proposals that we put to  him about some of the immediate benefit changes that the London Government are  proposing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have two final comments. First, regardless of what  happens with the immediate benefit regime changes, Iain Duncan Smith and Lord  Freud clearly have an ambition to have more fundamental changes. It is my sense  that that argument is currently being resolved in London between the Treasury  and the Department that is responsible for welfare, and that it may be the case  that we hear sooner rather than later what the scale, character and nature  might be of what Iain Duncan Smith is proposing.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">However, as I said during Question Time, if there is a proposal  between now and 2013 for, as he sees it, a radical regime change when it comes  to benefits, including the possibility of a universal benefit system, however  that may be managed, the immediate impact of that will be heavy upfront costs.  In a situation in which there is, apparently, less money, that must mean that  there will be more benefit cuts in the short term. I put down a marker, to  anybody in London who may be listening and to everybody in Northern Ireland,  that some very severe and serious news is coming. We must guard against that  and work against it.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">During the top-line Budget negotiation with London, we need  to be tough, robust, determined and relentless. We need to keep at it over the  weeks and months. That is what I have been doing; I trust that other Ministers  will follow that lead and are doing so at the moment. At the end of the day,  the bottom line is decided by the Assembly and the Executive Ministers. If the  bottom line Budget decisions are not informed by protecting those who are in need,  stress, disadvantage or poverty, we will end up with a Government that is not  fit for purpose and a Budget that is not fit for purpose.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Miss McIlveen</strong>:  The rationale behind the motion was to stimulate debate on the current welfare  system and its flaws and failings, and to give Members the opportunity to  explore options for the future. The consultation paper, &lsquo;21st Century Welfare&rsquo;,  which was presented by the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, Iain  Duncan Smith, has given us the basis for such a debate. The quality of that  debate is for others to judge, but I commend the tone of those who contributed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Having said that, I was astonished by the comments of Mr  Armstrong. I have always found him to be a very caring and compassionate man,  so it was strange that he said this afternoon that Northern Ireland needs to  cut benefit cheques. Perhaps those are not Mr Armstrong&rsquo;s views, but those of  the author of the script. Whoever&rsquo;s view it is, I do not think that anyone else  in the House agrees that cutting benefit payments is the answer to Northern  Ireland&rsquo;s problems. Perhaps the Tory cat is well and truly out of the Ulster  Unionist Party bag.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important, in this so-called age of austerity, to  ensure that we, as a society, take all possible steps to continue to protect  the vulnerable so that they do not bear the brunt of measures that are being  implemented to address an economic crisis that was born out of greed and  mismanagement. However, it is equally important that the social security system  is looked at, reviewed and improved, which would be as true in better times as  it is today. Social security is a devolved matter, and, therefore, the  responsibility of the Assembly. However, as much as the Members opposite would  like it not to be the case, it is an issue that is operated under the parity  principle. Therefore, a single system of benefits and pensions operates  throughout the United Kingdom.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is well rehearsed and recognised that Northern Ireland  has the highest levels of economic inactivity in the United Kingdom, with  around 6&middot;2% of our population not working. The Centre for Social Justice  estimates that around 40% of the 56,000 people who are currently unemployed in  Northern Ireland are long-term unemployed and that over half of those who claim  income support have done so for over five years. Therefore, although the  economic problems have added to the unemployment figure in recent years, there  is a portion of society that, for whatever reason, is unwilling or unable to  work and has been reliant on social security benefits for some considerable  time. Indeed, 14% of children live in households in which no one works. Around  50,000 men and women in Northern Ireland do not work because of mental or  behavioural problems. There are 42,000 people who claim disability living  allowance and about 45,000 who claim incapacity benefit. Those are  disproportionately high figures compared to the rest of the United Kingdom, but  one of many legacies of our recent troubled history.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Nearly one in 10 young people in Northern Ireland are not  in education, employment or training. As a result, their prospects for future  employment are greatly diminished. I commend the work of Bryson Charitable  Group and Barnardo&rsquo;s in that regard. I am also aware that the Committee for  Employment and Learning is currently undertaking an inquiry into that matter. I  look forward to the report and the outworkings of the recommendations.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Secretary of State for Work and Pensions has published  his Department&rsquo;s ideas on revolutionising the social security system across the  UK.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As my colleague Simon Hamilton outlined, reforms which make  the benefits system simpler and seek to increase economic activity are to be  warmly welcomed. However, such reforms must be carefully implemented. The cold,  hard reality is that Northern Ireland faces significant problems that will not  be encountered by other parts of the United Kingdom.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The legacy of the Troubles is that we have a  disproportionately high number of people who are unable to work because of  physical or mental impairment, a point elaborated on by Mrs Bradley, Ms Lo, Mr  Anderson and Mr Easton. Furthermore, the size of the public sector in Northern  Ireland, compared to the private sector, means that the impact of impending  cuts will be felt much more keenly here. That may result in an increase in the  number of those relying on benefits and even fewer job opportunities for those  already seeking work. Increased unemployment inevitably leads to increased  numbers of vulnerable people, which, again, was referred to by Mr Easton and Ms  N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Any radical overhaul is not without its problems, and often  changes implemented by Government are the most problematic. It is, therefore,  extremely important for the Minister for Social Development to continue his  dialogue with the Work and Pensions Secretary to ensure that Northern Ireland&rsquo;s  needs are not only recognised but met, and I am encouraged by the Minister&rsquo;s  words.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Many Members quoted statistics on the subject of high  dependency on social security. Mr Hamilton stated the alarming analysis that  the number of benefit claimants in Northern Ireland is proportionately 50%  higher than in the rest of GB. Mrs Bradley and Mr Easton spoke of the number of  constituents with whom they deal in their offices, and the broad range of benefits  that those constituents claim. Mr Armstrong recognised the high dependency on  benefits, yet seemed to think that we have a &ldquo;hokey-cokey&rdquo; approach to reform.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Craig said that the Government should be looking at  starting from scratch. He highlighted the additional barrier that bureaucracy  creates for applicants, which heightens the risk of error. He also spoke about  its complex and confusing nature, as did other Members.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Ms Lo supported the principle of welfare reform but was  concerned that those already marginalised would be further marginalised, and  she gave an example of problems with ESA and so on that had been brought to her  office. Mr Easton and others spoke of the cumbersome nature of the current  system.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Mr Brady did not appear to support change, even though  there is a clear need to encourage people back into work where jobs are  available. He highlighted what he believed to be the failings of the Welfare  Reform Bill and seemed to feel that it would penalise those on benefits.  Although welcoming elements of welfare reform, Ms Anderson spoke of her  concerns about certain aspects, for example, sanctions for trivial reasons. She  was also concerned about the centralisation that reforms may bring, but she  welcomed the Minister&rsquo;s statement and the negotiations that he has had. She  attempted to make a case for breaking parity and wanted a Northern  Ireland-specific benefit system without taking cognisance of the problems that  might be caused by such a system and its outworkings.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Beggs</strong>:  Does the Member agree that not only would there be great cost in funding any  break with parity in terms of the payments, but that the Assembly would also  have to fund, from the block grant, an entirely new computer and social  security system to back it up, which would be prohibitive?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Miss McIlveen</strong>:  Absolutely: I certainly agree with the Member&rsquo;s comments.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">There is a clear need for Northern Ireland&rsquo;s special social  and economic circumstances to be carefully considered. I note that the Minister  has been putting Northern Ireland&rsquo;s case forward, and I welcome his efforts.  Other Members &mdash; Mrs Bradley, Mr Hamilton, Mr Gallagher and Miss N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n &mdash;  made their own case for Northern Ireland&rsquo;s special circumstances. Ms N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n  spoke specifically about the need for childcare reform and about the lack of it  being a barrier for those getting back to work, particularly lone parents.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, I welcome the commitment of the Minister and  the work that he is doing, and also his response to the debate. It is fair to  say that it is universally recognised in the Chamber that the vulnerable in  Northern Ireland should not be made to suffer in the face of cuts and reforms  imposed without any recognition of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s particular circumstances.  It is important that those making such determinations are fully informed.  However, the message must also be delivered that we do not fear reform. Reform  is necessary to break the cycle of generational reliance on the welfare system.  In that sense, I very much agree with Iain Duncan Smith, who said that we need  to:</p>
    <p class="Q1QuoteIndented">&ldquo;end the poverty of aspiration that has trapped too  many people for generations.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextnoindent">Such reform must not come at any price, and it is  the duty of any society to protect and support the vulnerable. Therefore, in participating  in discussions on the &lsquo;21st Century Welfare&rsquo; Command Paper, the interests of  those who need our protection must be safeguarded.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyTextItalic">Resolved:</p>
    <p class="Q3Motion">That this Assembly acknowledges Northern Ireland&rsquo;s high  dependency on social security benefits; supports reforms which are aimed at  simplifying the social security process and helping people to get back to work;  and calls on the Minister for Social Development to continue his dialogue with  the Department for Work and Pensions, stressing the need for the special social  and economic circumstances of Northern Ireland to be carefully considered and  urging the introduction of appropriate measures to ensure that the proposed  welfare reforms do not have a disproportionately negative impact on Northern  Ireland.</p>

    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: The proposer of the topic for debate will have 15 minutes in which  to speak. All other Members who speak will have approximately eight minutes.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Maskey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I thank the Business Committee for  accepting the topic for debate. I also put on record my thanks to the Minister  of Finance and Personnel &mdash; it is not often that I thank Sammy, but there you go  &mdash; for his letter in response to e-mails that I sent to his private office on 1  or 3 and 6 September. Those related to ongoing security issues in the former  social security office in Slieveban Drive, which is in the heart of  Andersonstown.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I shall begin by giving a brief history of the place. On 21  May this year, DSD vacated the building to move to modern offices in the  Kennedy Centre in west Belfast. Since then, the building has been empty.  Initially, it was well secured. Indeed, I went around the site with a couple of  residents and noted that the steel shuttering had been well installed and was  secure. Unfortunately, adults &mdash; not children &mdash; removed some of the steel  shutters, which required them to use angle grinders, as departmental officials  pointed out to councillor Caoimh&iacute;n Mac Giolla Mh&iacute;n and me when we met them on  site. I suppose that the adults entered the premises out of greed to steal  lead, copper and anything else that was worth money. I reiterate that it was  adults and not children who began the process of causing antisocial behaviour  in the area.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">When we met the departmental officials, it was agreed that  the shutters would be reinstalled, and they were. As a matter of urgency, I had  asked the officials to remove any valuables that might be tempting to a thief,  such as copper and lead, from the site. Perhaps that part of the problem could  have been resolved earlier, but we learn from our mistakes.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The shutters were removed again, allowing younger elements  to get into the building and create havoc in the area. The building was set  alight, and old furniture was removed to an adjacent playing field where it was  set alight. Some young people got on to the roof of the building and threw  objects into the surrounding streets, making the area unsafe and frightening  many residents. On many occasions in recent months, members of the Fire and  Rescue Service, the PSNI and representatives of the safer neighbourhood  antisocial behaviour programme have dealt with fires and antisocial behaviour,  all of which has put the community under a great deal of pressure that it  should not have had to endure.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The current state of the building acts like a magnet for  antisocial elements, some of whom come from other areas. Not only do they  continue to damage the old offices, but there has been a dramatic surge in  crime, including break-ins to homes and the theft of cars from the vicinity. On  some weekends, there have been parties in the building, which, again, have  acted like a magnet for antisocial behaviour.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I know that, through my correspondence with the Minister,  there are now two security guards on the site every night from 5.00 pm to 7.00  am. That is a step in the right direction. I know that there had been issues  with the security guard who was previously employed on the site. I am not sure  of the details, but I know that some sort of threat had been made; perhaps the  Minister knows more than I do. I was not aware of that situation; had I been, I  would have challenged those who made any such threat. In his correspondence the  Minister said that battery-operated CCTVs would be installed on the premises.  CCTV cameras had already been installed there but had been damaged by  antisocial elements. It would be of benefit to the residents nearby and the  entire community if the security staff were kept in place until a future use  for the site is found.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I delivered about 1,000 leaflets in that area last night,  and I spoke to residents, as I have done over recent weeks and months, about  the issue. The residents have been greatly affected by the situation. They  said, however, that, since the security staff had been put in place, antisocial  behaviour in the area had reduced. I give credit where credit is due; however,  I urge the Minister to retain the security staff on the site nightly from 5.00  pm to 7.00 am, because the measure seems to be working and it gives residents  some peace of mind.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I want now to turn to the future use of the site. I am  aware that the Housing Executive and Belfast City Council have expressed  interest in it. I have spoken to many residents in the area, and my office has  been contacted by others who are concerned about the future use of the site.  That part of Andersonstown is a very settled area, and many of its residents  have lived there for many years. Many pensioners live in the area, as do many  schoolchildren. The people of the area deserve credit for the community spirit  that they have built up over many years. The British Army vacated the land that  they stole to build a military base right on the doorsteps of local people. The  site was known locally as Silver City, but the military base is long gone, and  the community has moved on.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Some of the residents expressed concern that there has been  no creative thinking on the part of the Housing Executive. They say that, once  the plot of land becomes available, the Housing Executive will simply claim it  and cram as many houses as it can onto it. I am glad that the Minister for  Social Development is here to hear my concerns and those of residents. My party  colleagues and I deal day and daily with people who are on the housing waiting  list for west Belfast. Andersonstown is one of the most sought-after locations  in the west of the city. We need to have a serious debate about how we build  extra houses. There is a desperate need to fill the gap and reduce the Housing  Executive waiting list.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We cannot just build houses on every available space  without considering the infrastructure in the community and in the larger area.  There are schools in the vicinity of the site as well as GAA clubs and soccer  teams, all of which have a shortage of playing facilities. I mention playing  facilities and pitches because there is a Belfast City Council-run pitch and  play-park adjacent to the site.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel &nbsp;(Mr S Wilson)</strong>:  I want to respond later in the debate, but I am not quite clear what the Member  is saying. Is he saying that he does not want housing on that site?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Maskey</strong>:  I am saying that it could be a mixed-use site, Sammy. As I said, I was in the  area last night delivering 1,000 leaflets. Again last night and over recent  weeks and months, residents told me that they are concerned that cramming as  many houses as possible onto the site would create a bottleneck in the area.  There are nursery, primary and post-primary schools in the vicinity, and people  are saying that, because it is a well-settled area, the site could be used as a  multipurpose facility. The concern is that, if the site goes to the Housing  Executive simply to build houses, the adjacent green field, which is used as a  playing pitch, would go because there would be pressure to build houses on it  as well.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">It is important to have facilities around the area. As I  said, there is a great housing shortage in west Belfast, and we lobby daily to  get people placed in houses. However, we must use creative thinking when we  consider that entire site. If Belfast City Council, other Departments and,  possibly, the Housing Executive use creative thinking, we could create a  facility that will enhance the local community instead of bottlenecking it with  the additional traffic that will stem from the Housing Executive&rsquo;s cramming as  many home units as possible onto it. Mixed use of the site, in my view, is the  best option. As I said, Belfast City Council has already expressed an interest  in it and could take full or part ownership and create a multipurpose building  that will cater for sporting teams, schools and the community sector. Local  residents are crying out for facilities that meet their needs.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Upper Andersonstown Community Forum, which is known  locally as Tullymore, is just up the street from the old offices on the broo or  dole site. It has recently extended its premises, and thanks must be given to  the Department for Social Development for giving money to that. The Minister  and the MP, Gerry Adams, were at the opening a number of weeks ago; that is a  very positive step. The Tullymore site is probably one of the most proactive  and valuable resources in the area and one of the largest employers in  Andersonstown. All its staff need to be commended, especially Tish Holland, who  has driven the community sector in that area for many years.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Tullymore is maxed out already with the many initiatives  that are in place, from childcare to pensioners&rsquo; clubs, education facilities  and after-school projects. There need to be further developments in the  vicinity to cater for the needs of the community, and I urge Minister Attwood  to think seriously about that before he allows the Housing Executive to  purchase the land simply to squeeze as many houses or apartments as possible  onto it. In my view and that of many residents in that area, that will have a  detrimental effect on that well-established part of the city. There is also the  local library site in Slievegallion, which, unfortunately, closed its doors to  the public in July this year. We are working proactively to get library services  in the local community centre, and I hope that that will go some way to bridge  the gap. That facility could be used by the Upper Andersonstown Community  Forum.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Today&rsquo;s debate is important for the local community. There  has been a blight of antisocial behaviour in recent months since the building  closed. As I said, Silver City was in the heart of the Andersonstown area and  on the doorsteps of many people&rsquo;s homes. That community has moved on in a  positive manner, and it deserves better than to have a load more houses crammed  onto the site.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">We need creative thinking, and I urge Departments, councils  and any other bodies to consult the local community in that area. That is an  important step. However, tonight&rsquo;s Adjournment debate is the first step to  addressing the problems. Any Executive Minister who deals with that area should  know that I, as a local representative and local resident, will work my hardest  to ensure that whatever is done is done right. I will assist any Minister,  Department or council that takes on the issue. I support them all, but we must  begin consultation as soon as possible. I know that our budgets are under tight  constraints, but we must move in a positive direction.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">5.45 pm</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I thank Paul Maskey for bringing the issue to the attention of the Assembly.  The debate touches on broader issues about land use, community participation,  maximum return of available land and the right profile and balance to take land  forward for development purposes. Over and above the Slieveban site, it raises  broader themes and issues that can be usefully discussed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The jobs and benefits office at Slieveban Drive is now  closed, and a new facility is open at the Curley&rsquo;s site. I encourage the  Minister to visit jobs and benefits offices, which he will know about from his  own experience. The jobs and benefits office at the Curley&rsquo;s site demonstrates  that a new facility improves the working environment and customer service. It  actually moderates behaviour. People going into a better-managed and new  facility that is geared to the needs of individual claimants has resulted in  the very few people who misbehave behaving better and generally moderating  behaviour and improving the service. There is something that might be worthy of  consideration in all of that in going forward with a capital budget.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I agree with Paul Maskey that, with respect to land use, we  need to move forward not only with the consultation of local communities but  with their participation. That is what DSD and the Housing Executive have been  trying to do, for example, with the demolition of the flats at Ross Street,  where individual, one-on-one consultation has taken place with tenants and the  two homeowners. There is a standard around not only consulting communities but  participation that is crucial.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Adams</strong>: I  do not wish to misrepresent what the Member said, but I found his comments  about citizens behaving themselves better in the new benefits centre to be  entirely patronising. It misrepresents what people who are subjected to  unemployment have to go through sometimes in what is a very difficult process.  It may not have been meant the way it sounded, but I think that the Member  should reflect on what he said.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Attwood</strong>:  I note the intervention from Mr Adams. I think that Mr Adams should reflect and  read Hansard. I made it clear that the people who misbehaved were the few who  did so. That was the language that I used. If Mr Adams were to speak to our  social security staff, who are the subject of the highest levels of  work-related stress of any employees in the public service in Northern Ireland,  I am sure that he would appreciate that the people who are on the front line in  social security offices have to take abusive phone calls and comments at desks  from the few abusive claimants. If Mr Adams were to do that, he would agree  that my comments are very relevant and very accurate. Given my responsibility,  in a different role, for social security staff, I do not take lightly any  comments that suggest either on the customer side or on the staff side that I have  anything other than appropriate respect for all that they have to go through  and experience.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I turn back to the debate. There is no intention, as far as  I am aware, by the Housing Executive, the DSD or the Planning Service to cram  houses into sites. That is contrary to planning conditions and guidelines, and  it is contrary to the core strategy of the DSD and the Housing Executive.  Therefore, the development of land is not a matter of cramming properties onto  sites; it is a proportionate and proper use of the site that is available.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">My view as an MLA is that, if there is housing use at that  site in the future, the use should be strictly for family homes, and there  should not be any suggestion of apartments in what is already a very  constrained site. In my own view, indicatively, if there were to be housing on  all of that land, it would be up to and no more than 20 housing units, and  those would be three-bedroom housing units. That would be an appropriate,  proportionate and prudent use of land that is available and, as Members should  remember, of land that is in government ownership. Therefore, given the  principle of trying to build on land that is in government ownership, the site  could be very amenable to all those outcomes.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">As far as I am concerned and speaking in any capacity that  I might have, I should say that there is no suggestion that there be cramming  on any site. There have been examples of such cramming, and Mr Maskey and Mr  Adams know full well of the apartment blight on the Andersonstown Road and the  efforts that some developers have made to create a similar blight on the Glen  Road and elsewhere. Given that experience and given the risk and the threat  that arise occasionally as a result of Planning Service decisions, the site is  not about cramming. It is about family homes. A moderate number of family homes  would be involved, and there would not have to be a disproportionate impact on  traffic use and pedestrian safety in the area.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I am concerned about ensuring that government works its  maximum for people in west Belfast. Too often, I have seen Ministers go into  government but not into power. There is a fundamental difference in culture and  outcomes when it comes to the nature of government. That is why, once the land  in question became available, the Housing Executive was right to move quickly  to scope out whether it was suitable for housing use. It was also right to  appoint a housing association to seek proposals for design in the future. In my  view, all that is an example of government moving quickly. However, government  working quickly must be consistent with what I said at the beginning of my  response about community involvement and participation. Going forward,  regardless of whether the site will be exclusively for housing use or for mixed  use, it should be done in consultation with the community to maximise the  benefit to that community. That should include maximising the benefits to an  area that is of high choice among social tenants and where there is already  high need and high stress.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. This is probably one of the most  unusual debates that this Assembly has had, in that we will receive information  from a Minister whose constituency remit is in and around the site in question  and who will be speaking as a local MLA. It will be useful to get some of that  information, which will lead me to make a suggestion to Alex Attwood MLA, the  Minister for Social Development, in my comments. I will never miss this  opportunity, Alex, to comment on what you said.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I welcome the debate. It is important for the reasons that  Paul Maskey and Alex Attwood gave, and I commend Paul for securing the debate.  Paul said that antisocial behaviour from the young and, indeed, the not so  young in and around the site is to be challenged and that it has been at every  opportunity. Everyone in the Chamber is well aware, first and foremost, of the  broken window syndrome, so I will not give a lesson on that. We need to ensure  that we are not allowing the site to become a magnet or allowing it to continue  to be a magnet for antisocial behaviour on a daily, if not a weekly, basis.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Paul highlighted some of the problems associated with the  site. Indeed, in the times that we are in, those are problems that local  residents, the local community and voluntary sectors do not need. The blue  light services in particular do not need to be called out constantly to deal  with antisocial behaviour, and that leads to the question of how much those  additional call-outs are costing us.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I take this opportunity to praise those in the local area,  including those who are involved in the safer neighbourhood project, without  whose involvement we would probably be dealing, God forbid, with more serious  issues on a regular basis. I give credit where credit is due to the work that  DFP has done to secure the site and to deal with some of the ongoing issues.  However, consultation is the key theme in all the points that have been made.  We now need the residents and the local community to be informed and kept up to  date with the plans or the suggested plans for the site.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Paul voiced the concerns of some of the residents in the  area, and those are genuine concerns. It is not a case of not in my back  garden; there are genuine concerns about the whole issue of housing in the  area. No one for one minute underestimates the need for additional housing in  the West Belfast constituency, and no one is suggesting that more houses should  not be built there, but we need proper infrastructure first, which is the point  that Paul made.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In the letter that the Minister wrote to my colleague, he  stated that he received a valuation of the property and would be meeting  interested parties within a week. That letter was dated 17 September, and it  would be useful if the Minister could indicate who those interested parties  are.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Will the Minister also tell the House whether there are any  proposals for him to meet with the community sector in the constituency,  including, as Paul mentioned, the Upper Andersonstown Community Forum and the  West Belfast Partnership Board? We should not lose sight of the fact that there  is a vibrant community in West Belfast, which, to all intents and purpose, is  up to speed and has a sound mind on some, if not all, of the issues that affect  our community. Perhaps the Minister could meet the sector before the site is  sold off. It is all right talking to the statutory agencies, but the Minister  also needs to speak to the community and voluntary sector in the area.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Alex Attwood contributed to the debate as an MLA for West  Belfast. I want to take the opportunity to sneak in a request for him, wearing  his ministerial hat and in front of all the MLAs from West Belfast, to provide  an update on what DSD&rsquo;s thinking is on the issue. That is not to say that the  land will be sold to DSD, but it would be useful to understand the options that  the Department has for the site. It would mean we all have the same information  from the outset and that we can all be involved in the consultation.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Perhaps Minister Wilson could also tell us whether a  request to take the site forward has been received from any other Departments.  That is only a request for information so that we can ensure that we do not  have to deal with a debacle like those we have dealt with in the past, with  bits of information being received here and there. Everyone wants the site to  be secured and to have no more antisocial behaviour on it. They also want the  site to be used for the benefit of the community in and around that area and  for the betterment of the community of the greater west Belfast area.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In conclusion, I want to commend the Minister. I am not  sure whether I have a death wish. In fairness, he has a long history of working  in local government and of working in partnership with local communities to try  to get local solutions to local problems. It is all right saying that DFP will  sell off the land, offset it to another Department and that the other  Department will take it on. We are now in a collective Executive. We are  talking about collective, joined-up government, and that is all about taking a  partnership approach. There is no point in us imposing something on a community  if it goes against its wishes and creates more difficulties and problems. We  must utilise the local representatives and MLAs, because together we can ensure  that everyone is happy with whatever is placed on the site.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I am happy to respond to the debate at this late  stage. It is like being kept in at school; I had to wait until 5.30 pm to  respond.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I know from the correspondence that I received that the  issue has caused the local community great difficulties. Indeed, Paul Maskey  made that clear in the communications he sent to the Department. As always, I  have tried to be as helpful as possible, and I am glad that he acknowledged  that at least.</p>
    <p class="TimePeriod">6.00 pm</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">In our roles as constituency representatives, all of us who  are left in the Chamber &mdash; there are not too many of us &mdash; fully understand the  difficulties caused by derelict buildings and the horror that the people who  have to live, day in and day out, beside them can experience. Many people feel  powerless because they have no control over what can be done with such  buildings. Many people feel that public bodies do not move as quickly as they  should and that the people who make the decisions do not recognise what local  people are going through, wondering, every night, whether they are going to  have something thrown at their house or whether they are going to be disturbed.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have asked departmental officials to try to move the  process along as quickly as possible and, where there are problems, to try to  address those. That is one reason why today&rsquo;s debate is useful. However, having  listened to the debate, I am concerned that there are perhaps conflicting  tensions. On the one hand, Members want something done about the problem  quickly, and I can understand that. On the other hand, Members want to add in  all the other things that people want done &mdash; I will come to that in a moment &mdash;  which, by their very nature, would slow the process down and, therefore, leave  us with the problem of the derelict building for longer. There are conflicting  tensions.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr P Maskey</strong>:  No matter what happens on the site &mdash; whether it is used for 20 houses, as the  Minister said the Housing Executive could provide, or a multi-purpose facility  &mdash; the concern that we all have is that it will take years to get planning  permission and financing and for the demolition and building to be done. It is  going to take a couple of years to get the site to that stage. If we start now,  we could shorten that period and put something on the site that is much needed  in that community.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">The Minister will know from his days on Belfast City  Council that there is a shortage of pitches across the city. With, as I said, a  buy-in from Belfast City Council, the pitch beside the site could be utilised  and turned into a 3G pitch. In Belfast, 50% of the shortage of pitches is in  west Belfast. The site could be used as a sports facility for schools, the  local GAA and local soccer teams.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I have noted what the Member said about the use of  the land. A number of purposes have been suggested, from pitches to  multi-purpose business facilities and from community use to housing or  recreational land. The site is a not very well shaped 2&middot;3 acres of land. We  have to be realistic: it is not the Tardis. It is a fairly small piece of land  and, given all the competing interests, we have to be realistic about what can go  on the site.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I will outline for Members the factual position. When land  is declared surplus to requirements by a Department, there is an obligation to  trawl for interest amongst public bodies and for a valuation to be done. The  valuation of the land in this case is &pound;1&middot;1 million, which is significantly less  than what it would have been valued at two or three years ago. However, that is  what Land and Property Services has deemed the land to be worth on the public  market. That puts certain constraints on the use of the land. For example, if  we were to put 20 houses on a piece of land that is valued at &pound;1&middot;1 million, it  would cost around &pound;55,000 per unit for the land purposes alone. Members can see  that, therefore, there would be financial constraints to that. The valuation  has been done and a trawl has been carried out among the Departments. Under the  rules for the disposal of land, if an interest is shown by other public sector  bodies, that interest must be looked at first.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not want this to drag on, and I understand Members&rsquo;  points. I have said to officials to let us put the next step in place so that  it does not drag on for ever. In conversation with the two bodies that  expressed an interest, namely the Housing Executive and Belfast City Council,  we now need to ascertain what they intend to put on the site and whether the  money is available and do all the tests that will indicate whether it is likely  to be a runner. If the two bids remain in place after that exploration, the  Minister for Social Development and the Minister of the Environment will have  to determine which bid is to be accepted and look at the associated business  case. That is the rule.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">Sue Ramsey raised the issue of the community sector. Under  the current disposal rules, we cannot bring in the community sector until we  have tested the interest from DSD and Belfast City Council. I have said to  officials &mdash;</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Ms S Ramsey</strong>:  Is the Minister saying that it would be possible to bring in the community  sector after he tests what DSD and Belfast City Council intend to do with the  site?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: That is possible after the plans of Belfast City  Council and DSD have been tested. One of the tests that will be applied  immediately is whether the money is available at present. There is no point in  DSD telling me that it would like to buy the site, that it does not have any  money now but that it might have the money in four years&rsquo; time. If that were  the case, we would not regard that as a real expression of interest, and we  would move on. Those kinds of tests have to be done with the Departments to  find out whether we proceed to the next step.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I do not want that process to go on for ever. Members of  Belfast City Council will know well that if the matter went to the council&rsquo;s  leisure services committee, or whatever it is called now, it could get kicked  back five, six or seven times. Indeed, the council could be discussing it in a  year&rsquo;s time. The important thing is to set a timetable.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  Will the Minister give way?</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I will after I finish this point. I do not know if  it is a realistic timetable, but I have asked officials whether we can get the  process completed in six weeks. That would give the sort of certainty that the  Member asked for. I will give way now.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr F McCann</strong>:  We could end up with what is probably everyone&rsquo;s worst nightmare: another  leisure centre just across the road. The discussion about what will replace the  building that is on the site at present is interesting. However, one of the  difficulties is that that building is a magnet for those who want to destroy  their community. Such buildings often lie there and are destroyed, having  become hangouts for antisocial elements in the area. Would it not be better if  those buildings were flattened and returned to grass? That would mean that  there will be a clear site when it comes to building on it.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: I am getting worried, because I think that the  Member may have read my mind. The next point that I was going to make concerned  that nightmare that can be left by derelict buildings. I do not imagine that  either of the two groups that have expressed an interest, Belfast City Council  or the Housing Executive, will want the building to be left on the site, anyway.  Those groups will be more interested in the piece of land.</p>
    <p class="B3BodyText">I have said to officials to let us start the process of  demolishing the building as quickly as possible. There are a number of steps in  that process. Safety checks have to be carried out to ensure that all the  services are turned off and that there is asbestos in the building. A tender  then goes out, and the contractor comes in. We hope to complete all that and  have the building demolished in about 10 weeks. I hope that that timescale  gives some comfort to the Members who raised the issue. That should also give  some comfort to people that, come the dark nights, the building will not there  as the kind of magnet for vandalism that Mr McCann described. As it is likely  that any group that has an interest will have an interest only in the site  rather than in the building, I do not think that we are taking any risks by  demolishing the building. Therefore, that will be the next step.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>Mr Deputy  Speaker</strong>: I ask the Minister to bring his remarks to a close.</p>
    <p class="B1SpeakersName"><strong>The Minister of  Finance and Personnel</strong>: In conclusion, I hope that I have, at least,  illustrated that we are taking the issue seriously. There are restrictions  about how wide we can throw the net.
