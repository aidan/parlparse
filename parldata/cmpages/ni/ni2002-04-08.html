              for me to thank Members for their kind wishes and the expressions
              of goodwill that were extended to me after my recent accident, and
              also to thank you, Mr Speaker, for your letter? Those good wishes
              helped me a lot on my way to recovery. I am still recovering but
              am glad to be back.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is, indeed, in order. On behalf of the whole
              House, I shall say what a great pleasure it is to see you back in
              your place, and able to serve the House and your constituents. We
              were all upset to hear about your accident and are greatly pleased
              that you are back with us.</p>
              <b>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On a point of order, Mr Speaker. We are
              concerned about the welfare of our elected representatives. Will
              you provide an opportunity for comment to be made on intimidating
              and horrendous attacks on Members’ homes, such as the despicable
              attack on the home of Mr Eugene McMenamin, a Member for West
              Tyrone?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Speaker:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member is aware that I must operate within
              Standing Orders. There is no Standing Order that permits me to
              open the matter for debate. Members may wish to use the normal
              routes, such as questions, motions or other ways to raise the
              matter.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have no doubt that the whole House, like me,
              was extremely upset, concerned and angry to hear about the episode
              over the weekend. My office is already taking the usual actions,
              as, unfortunately, that is not the first episode of threatening or
              intimidation of Members. If there is anything else that the
              Member, Mr McMenamin or any of his Colleagues feel that my Office
              or I can do, I trust that they will be in touch with me.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have no doubt that the House is extremely
              concerned about the matter. It is an attack on Mr McMenamin and
              his family, but it is not solely an attack on them — it is an
              attack on the entire process of representative democracy, because
              he is one of us as a representative. Undoubtedly, the whole House
              will share that concern. However, I have no leeway to introduce
              the matter other than through the normal process, which the Member
              may wish to take up.</p>

              residents of Newtownards, the surrounding district and further
              afield. It carries the signatures of more than 1,000 or 1,100
              people who are very concerned about the many incidents of badger
              baiting that persist. Children from Movilla High School in
              Newtownards — Stacy Paul, Ryan McCullough and Sarah Hill —
              were instrumental in collecting the signatures, and they are in
              the Gallery today. Residents from Newtownards are particularly
              perturbed that, despite legislation, badgers are still being
              persecuted, and the law is insufficient to ensure their
              protection. Given that and the need for better protection under
              the law, we present the petition to the Assembly for
              consideration.</p>

              responsibility for local development, who has responsibility for
              the Irish national drugs strategy, represented the Irish
              Government and chaired the meeting. Mr Bob Ainsworth MP,
              Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Home Office,
              represented the British Government. Dr Richard Simpson MSP, Deputy
              Minister for Justice, represented the Scottish Executive. Ms Jane

              who is Chairperson of the Drugs Strategy Committee. The States of
              Guernsey were represented by Deputy Roger Berry OBE, President of
              the Board of Administration. The States of Jersey were represented
              by Deputy Roy George Le Hérissier, Vice-President of the Health
              and Social Services Committee. This statement has been approved by

              individual drugs strategies. The meeting was informed of several
              ongoing pieces of work with regard to drugs, including the
              targeting of the proceeds of drugs trafficking, community
              involvement in the development and implementation of drugs
              strategies, the diverting into healthier pursuits of young people
              who are at risk of drugs misuse, and the reintegration of drugs
              misusers into training and employment.</p>

              in involving communities in local strategies was agreed.</p>

              Executive, presented the paper. Members agreed that a conference
              for practitioners would be held later in the year, either in
              Scotland or Ireland, to advance the exchange of information in
              that area.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Ministers agreed that the next meeting on
              drugs in sectoral format would take place in February 2003. The

              is encouraging for us all to see attention being focused on the
              growing problem of drug abuse across all these islands. It
              pervades all social strata and is a particular problem in deprived

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Drug abuse is a serious problem that transcends
              political borders. There is ample evidence of that, with drug
              trafficking spreading across entire continents, wrecking countless
              lives and, indeed, blighting whole communities. It is vital,
              therefore, that the various Administrations on these islands
              continue to co-operate fully on the matter by sharing expertise
              and practical initiatives that help address the scourge of illicit
              drugs in modern society.</p>

              organisations may be involved in mentoring and providing mentors?
              Do the educational programmes envisaged involve the Department of
              Education, and will they be brought directly into school

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Member for his question. The issue
              arose during the discussion on the Positive Futures initiative,
              which was launched in England in March 2000. Some 24 projects were
              set up around the country to provide sporting programmes for
              youngsters at risk. Their success in reducing criminal activity
              and in obtaining better attendances at school, healthier
              lifestyles and increased involvement with sports led to the
              setting up of a further 33 projects on 1 March 2002.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The projects involve people in the fields of
              education and sport, and some sporting figures have lent their
              assistance to the schemes by giving positive alternatives to young
              people at risk. The projects provide training, mentoring schemes
              and education programmes around positive attitudes, healthy
              lifestyles and leadership skills. A joint Positive Futures
              steering group oversees the initiative’s progress.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a result, Ministers at the British-Irish
              Council meeting on 22 March 2002 agreed that representatives from
              each area would visit a Positive Futures scheme at Leyton Orient
              to learn more about the initiatives. After that visit, I shall be
              able to bring the Member up to date on further lessons to be
              learned.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat. I too welcome the Minister’s
              statement, and her focus on targeting and tackling drug misuse. My
              interest is in community involvement in developing and
              implementing drug strategies. The Minister spoke about drug misuse
              at a recent conference in my West Belfast constituency, as did Jo
              Deakin, the new drugs tsar. I would be interested to hear the
              Minister expand on why she sees the initiave as an important step.
              The report of that conference deals with community involvement. It
              is due for publication, and I ask that she examine it closely.
              There is no need to reinvent the wheel.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Member for her question, and I
              shall be more than happy to look at the report when it is
              published. I welcome such initiatives, because it is important
              that communities are involved. My reply to Mr Gallagher gave some
              examples of community involvement for youngsters at risk. As a
              result of the working groups and the new structures set up to
              combat the misuse of drugs and alcohol, the communities lead a
              working group on communities. They have not only 22 places in the
              structure, they also have the lead, and each of the other groups
              is led by the relevant Department. For example, the Department of
              Education leads the education group, and the Department of Health,
              Social Services and Public Safety leads the treatment working
              group. It was felt important that communities themselves should
              lead the communities working group.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Such aspects will be included in the regional
              action plan developed by the six working groups. That contains 115
              activities that must be undertaken if our strategy’s objectives
              are to be met. Many of the initiatives are community-based,
              because communities must be involved if we are to tackle the
              scourge of drug and alcohol misuse, both of which have a
              considerable negative impact throughout our community.</p>

              Party supports the Department of Health, Social Services and
              Public Safety’s management of the issue. However, there will
              always be a significant policing element involved in dealing with
              the issue. Does the Minister endorse the presentation that was
              made on targeting the proceeds of the drugs trade and asset
              confiscation? Given that policing is part of all communities, does
              the Minister agree that co-operation with the police must be
              included in any drugs strategy? Will the Minister now encourage
              her supporters to join the new Police Service of Northern Ireland,

              which political parties were present, on trying to bounce people
              or on trying to play word games. It was a constructive meeting, at
              which no one felt the need to shout from the sidelines — <i>[Interruption].</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member asked about the proposed Guernsey
              seminar. All Ministers agreed that Guernsey would host a seminar
              on 16 and 17 May to discuss targeting the proceeds of the drugs
              trade and asset confiscation. I consider the Northern Ireland
              Office (NIO) to be a part of that; in fact, it is entirely within
              its remit. As the proceeds of the drugs trade and asset
              confiscation are reserved matters, officials from the NIO and the
              Department of the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) will

              the Minister does not think that I am trying to score political
              points. The paper that was presented at the meeting highlights the
              importance of involving the community in the development and
              implementation of drugs strategies. Unfortunately, in north and
              west Belfast, two drugs organisations that do good work have been
              refused funding twice. They are based in the Shankill and Falls
              areas. Through working with professionals, the organisations
              provide educational programmes in schools and clubs to show young
              people the bad effects of drugs. Therefore, I find it ironic that,
              although we intend to do something about good practice, we cannot
              even support good practice on our own doorstep in north and west
              Belfast. Will the Minister confirm how many community
              organisations have been funded, how much funding they have
              received, and in which parliamentary constituencies they are
              located?</p>

              obviously well attended by Ministers from throughout the island.
              Judging by the report, the drugs problem affects all areas. I
              welcome the Minister’s initiative to involve community
              consultation at all times. The means of diverting young people who
              are at risk of drug misuse into healthier pursuits and of
              reintegrating drug abusers into training and employment must be
              addressed. Will extra funding be needed for those?</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yes, new initiatives will require new funding.
              Learning from best practice elsewhere allows us to do a certain
              amount without new funding. We can also put some new projects in
              place at the expense of current projects. However, 36 projects had
              been set up, for which funding was provided, and when the funding
              ran out at the end of March and my Department was unsuccessful in
              obtaining any further money, I had to find the money to fund the
              23 projects that came within my remit. Other projects will be
              referred to the Department of Employment and Learning, the
              Department of Education and the Northern Ireland Office to see
              whether they can continue the funding. The Executive and the
              Assembly must take on board the fact that money is required to
              fund projects.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for her statement. Did the
              meeting consider the important issue of possible heroin
              substitutes? In Glasgow, methadone has been used in an attempt to
              wean addicts off heroin, although its effects have caused
              controversy. It is important that we learn from the experience of
              the Greater Glasgow and Greater Dublin areas, where there are
              tragically high death rates from heroin usage.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Minister referred to drug trafficking. I
              want to ask particularly about the source of such trafficking. Is
              she willing to condemn all groups, wherever they are in the world
              — notably, although not only, those in Latin America, such as
              the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) — that are
              involved in the drug production chain at any point, from
              production to importation into north-west Europe?</p>

              Dublin came up briefly at the meeting and will be continued in
              future work. I also took the opportunity at the meeting to thank
              colleagues from Glasgow and Dublin for their valuable work for the

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">From time to time money is made available —
              £6·23 million was made available to the Executive. This money
              will be spent on the work to be undertaken by the working groups
              and will be used to implement the plans I mentioned earlier.
              However, we must also recognise that part and parcel of this work
              — whether in my Department, the Department for Employment and
              Learning, the Department of Education, the Department of the
              Environment, or the Department of Enterprise, Trade and
              Investment, all of which are represented on the ministerial
              strategic steering group — is the need for all Departments to
              address this from their budgets. The Executive will have to
              consider that, and it is not enough to look elsewhere for one-off
              moneys either. We need to look at this in our budget processing.
              Again, this matter did not come up at the British-Irish Council

              her statement; drug abuse is a serious matter for all communities
              in Northern Ireland. Can the Minister assure us that sufficient
              resources in Northern Ireland are being directed to combat drug
              abuse, and is she satisfied with the work of the Police Service of
              Northern Ireland? Is she right in stating that this problem exists
              mainly in poorer areas? Next door to my constituency of Strangford
              is your constituency of North Down, Madam Deputy Speaker. It is
              one of the more affluent constituencies in Northern Ireland, yet

              will be present at this meeting. Of course, the Minister will be

              to my statement. I could hardly hear myself for most of this

              Unionist Party finds this issue and what its approach to it will
              be. Drugs cross all boundaries. No community can be complacent,
              nor can any political party. This is not a matter for political
              sniping, catcalling or other ways of minimising the important work
              that went on in Dublin on 22 March, as I am sure the Ulster
              Unionist Party member, who was there in his capacity as Minister
              of the Environment, could share with his Colleagues.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are making considerable resources available.
              I have considered often how that can be done, as have other
              Ministers as regards their contribution to the overall alcohol and
              drugs strategy. We are approximately £4 million short in
              implementing proposed action plans, and that must be considered.
              It is one reason why we have talked about — as we have done in
              most other areas — the difference between our plans and the
              resources that we can devote to them. The issue will straddle

              Conduct of Members approved by the Assembly.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The amendments to Standing Orders are primarily
              technical and were submitted to the Committee on Procedures by the
              Committee on Standards and Privileges. The amendments have been
              checked by the Assembly legal adviser and are considered to be
              legally competent.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The amendments focus on two issues. First, they
              centre on references in Standing Orders to the Code of Conduct and
              the ‘Guide to the Rules Relating to the Conduct of Members’,
              which have both been approved by the Assembly. Secondly, they
              focus on the power of the Committee on Standards and Privileges to
              recommend a lesser penalty than that which Standing Orders
              currently provides for a breach of the Code of Conduct or the ‘Guide
              to the Rules Relating to the Conduct of Members’.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first two amendments on the Order Paper are
              interrelated. They focus on the ‘Guide to the Rules Relating to
              the Conduct of Members’, which was amended by the Assembly on 15
              October 2001. Standing Orders refer to one specific code of
              conduct and one specific guide. However, the Committee on
              Standards and Privileges believes that more than one guide may
              exist; therefore, it felt that specific reference to the current
              guide was unnecessary. The proposed amendment to Standing Order
              52(4)(c) would serve to remove the reference to the specific guide
              and replace it with reference to &quot;any Guide&quot; or any
              &quot;Code of Conduct&quot;.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, on the advice of the Assembly legal
              adviser it was considered necessary to maintain reference to the
              current guide in Standing Order 64. That is because paragraph 5 of
              Standing Order 64 refers to a specific paragraph in the current
              ‘Guide to the Rules Relating to the Conduct of Members’. That
              is why the second amendment proposes to include the last date at
              which the guide was amended — 15 October 2001. It follows that
              if the guide is amended again, the Standing Order must be amended
              accordingly.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The amendment to Standing Order 64(6) makes it
              clear that the Committee on Standards and Privileges can report to
              the Assembly when it is of the view that a Member has failed to
              comply with, or has contravened, a provision of any code of
              conduct that has been agreed by the Assembly. As with the previous
              amendments, the key point is the inclusion of the reference to
              &quot;any Code of Conduct&quot;. The current wording of Standing
              Order 64(6) refers to a contravention of the provisions of that
              particular Standing Order and, by inference, of the ‘Guide to
              the Rules Relating to the Conduct of Members’. However, the
              Committee on Standards and Privileges considered it important that
              Standing Orders should make it clear that it also refers to
              contravention of any code of conduct which the Assembly has
              agreed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The final amendment also pertains to Standing
              Order 64. It proposes a minor amendment to the recommendations
              that the Committee on Standards and Privileges can make when it
              chooses to report a Member to the Assembly. Under the present
              arrangements the Assembly Ombudsman, on completion of his
              investigation, will report to the Committee on Standards and
              Privileges. The Committee may, in turn, choose to make a report to
              the Assembly. That report can contain a recommendation for
              exclusion from proceedings for a specified period and withdrawal
              of rights and privileges as a Member for that period.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the current wording of Standing Order
              64(7), and in particular the use of the word
              &quot;contained&quot;, gives no scope for the Committee to
              recommend a lesser penalty — for example, an apology. The
              Committee considers that it would be more reasonable for it to
              have such flexibility. As such, the amendment proposes that in
              Standing Order 64(7) the word &quot;contain&quot; be replaced by
              &quot;include&quot;, and the Committee on Procedures agrees.</p>

              report and recommendations. We believe that the change gives more
              weight to our recommendations and is a truer reflection of the
              work and commitment shown by members of the Committee over the
              past six months. I shall speak on the amendment.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.00 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall start by giving some background on how
              EU issues impact on Northern Ireland and why the Committee of the
              Centre and I believe that it is an important area worthy of
              in-depth consideration. European issues are not devolved matters.
              The European Union is a union of member states, and a council of
              the relevant Ministers from the member states — the Council of
              Ministers — and the European Parliament make decisions.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the Committee’s investigations, it
              came as a surprise to discover that up to 60% of our legislation
              comes from Europe, and 80% of the policies in our Programme for
              Government relate to, or originate from, European Union policies.
              Although the decisions are taken in Brussels, they are implemented
              in, and impact on, Northern Ireland. That gives the Northern
              Ireland Assembly and its Administration a clear role to play in EU
              affairs. The role is recognised and codified in the memorandum of
              understanding between the United Kingdom Government and the
              Northern Ireland Executive in the Concordat on Co-ordination of
              European Union Policy Issues.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">United Kingdom Ministers and Departments take
              policy lines on various issues under discussion in Europe. The
              relevant Minister subsequently takes that policy line to the
              Council of Ministers in Europe. It is, therefore, vital that
              Northern Ireland ensures that its voice is heard in London before
              the UK agrees its policy line. That is especially important when
              the issue under consideration will have a distinct or unique
              impact on our region.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Post-devolution, the Office of the First
              Minister and the Deputy First Minister created two new structures
              to reflect Northern Ireland’s changed role in EU affairs — the
              Office of the Northern Ireland Executive in Brussels and the
              European Policy Co-ordination Unit in the Office of the First
              Minister and the Deputy First Minister. The Committee visited the
              Office of the Northern Ireland Executive in Brussels in January
              2002 and used its premises as its headquarters while it carried
              out business there. The office has the remit of liaising with
              European Union institutions on issues that affect Northern
              Ireland. The occasion of the Committee’s visit to Brussels
              afforded Northern Ireland’s MEPs their first opportunity to
              visit the office.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Scottish Executive and the Welsh Assembly
              have similar offices. I wish to make it clear that the Committee
              welcomes the opening of the Brussels office. It is an essential
              step if Northern Ireland is to create its own voice in Europe and
              have a say in the UK policy line to Brussels. The offices are well
              situated and well appointed, and every consideration has been
              given to security. Given that the staff work under the umbrella of
              the UK Permanent Representation to Brussels (UKRep), which gives
              them diplomatic status and access to confidential papers, security
              considerations are important. However, the Committee has major
              concerns about the approach that the office adopts. Those concerns
              centre on the fact that the office was initially set up only for
              the Executive. That was done despite the expectation of the
              Northern Ireland Centre in Europe that it would share office space
              with the Office of the Northern Ireland Executive.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee questions that narrow approach.
              It also has concerns that so much office space is lying empty. The
              Northern Ireland people are paying for the office at a premium,
              and that space could be used to create a sense of an office for
              Northern Ireland, not simply an office for the Executive. All the
              evidence that the Committee received indicates that to succeed in
              the creation of a distinct voice for a region, it is necessary to
              involve all individuals and organisations that have an interest in
              Europe. That includes MEPs, the Assembly, local government and
              other non-governmental partners. The Scottish Executive and the
              Welsh Assembly have taken a co-operative networking approach, and
              the Committee believes that that is the best approach for Northern
              Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the Scottish Executive and the Welsh
              Assembly opened their offices in Brussels, they made a deliberate
              decision to work co-operatively with the organisations that were
              already there. The Scottish Executive moved into the same building
              as Scotland Europa, and the Welsh Assembly shares office space
              with the Wales European Centre. Scotland and Wales built on the
              experience of the organisations that were already there, which
              allowed them to build on the existing contacts and make use of
              existing networks.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A platform for all of Scotland and Wales, it
              also created a sense of a region working together. A complementary
              system exists between non-Government and Government, which only
              enhances the profile of the region. As many individuals told us
              during our visit to Brussels, the European Commission, the
              European Council of Ministers and the Parliament do not want to
              hear five or six different voices from one region. Representations
              are more likely to be effective when all sectors and parties work
              together.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the Committee began the inquiry, we were
              concerned at the lack of such a co-operative partnership-led
              approach. We welcome indications from the junior Minister and from
              the First and Deputy First Ministers that that is now being
              addressed. This change, however welcome, does not address the
              issue of why the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First
              Minister did not initially develop a working relationship with the
              Northern Ireland Centre in Europe, which had a base in Brussels.
              It did, and still does, have a wide range of contacts and access
              to important and influential networks. It has in-depth knowledge
              and expertise, which can be used for all of Northern Ireland. The
              Committee understands that OFMDFM has reopened communication with
              the Northern Ireland Centre. I could be cynical and say that
              negotiations are only happening because of the inquiry. However,
              the Committee is more concerned that it is happening, rather than
              why it did not happen in the first place.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I have said, our focus was to ensure that
              the approach being taken was the best for Northern Ireland, and,
              to that end, we make several recommendations for the Brussels
              office that will improve the current approach. We welcome the
              statement by junior Minister Haughey that communication has been
              reopened with the Northern Ireland Centre in Europe and recommend
              that the Committee receive regular briefings on the progress of
              such communication. We also recommend that the Brussels office
              take a more co-operative and networking approach, that it looks at
              the Scottish and Welsh models of building on existing expertise
              and that it provides office space for non-governmental
              organisations. We would also like to see a change in its name, to
              reflect the more co-operative approach promised by the junior
              Minister in his evidence to the Committee, and by the First and
              Deputy First Ministers in their speeches at the office’s
              opening.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The other new structure put in place by OFMDFM
              since devolution is the European Policy and Co-ordination Unit,
              which sits within the Economic Policy Unit of OFMDFM. Its overall
              task is to provide a policy and co-ordination role for the
              Departments in developing their relationship with the European
              Union. The unit has identified six main areas of work, which are
              listed on page 253 of the report. The Committee focused on the
              co-ordination aspect of the unit’s work and found it to be
              disappointing. Of course, some leeway must be allowed, as it is a
              new unit that is starting from scratch. However, it has been
              operating for two years, and we expected it to have made more
              progress than it has done. For example, in the EU strategy, we
              find that OFMDFM’s corporate business plan was to be delivered
              in July 2001, and we still await it. What we eventually received,
              at the conclusion of the inquiry, was an intermediate document —
              the EU draft framework. Junior Minister Haughey indicated in his
              evidence that he aimed to complete the strategy before the
              Assembly breaks for the elections in 2003. That is almost two
              years behind schedule, which is totally unacceptable.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The EU draft framework also makes reference to
              several other strategies and related documents, such as the
              strategy for interregional co-operation and a policy on
              secondments. However, we have no indication of when those
              documents will be available for our scrutiny. The document is only
              a framework, but even within a framework we expect to see a
              certain level of detail on delivery, methodology, resources,
              expected outcomes, timescales and evaluation. Those are all
              missing from the document. For example, in the framework paper,
              aims and objectives, as set out in annex A of the document,
              objective 1 has four parts to it, but it gives no indication of
              how those will be achieved, the resources needed, how success or
              failure will be measured, et cetera. The document, which is
              contained in a written submission in the report, is called ‘A
              Framework for Developing Northern Ireland’s Participation in the
              European Union’, yet, on page 263 of the report, reference is
              made to a</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;co-ordinated strategy for the Northern
              Ireland Executive.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is not a strategy for Northern Ireland as
              the title would suggest. The document is based solely on the needs
              of the Departments and the Executive.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No recognition is given to the involvement of
              the Assembly and other key players, and when we passed the
              framework document to other Assembly Committees, their response
              showed that they had neither been consulted nor had been able to
              scrutinise the departmental priorities listed as EU priorities for
              Northern Ireland. Many of the written submissions received by the
              Committee noted that they had not even heard of the existence of
              such a document.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The junior Minister made reference to, and the
              Committee agrees that there is a need for a regional strategy that
              takes account of all Northern Ireland’s needs and not simply
              those of Departments. That approach is missing. As with the
              Brussels office, a narrow approach, based solely on the needs of
              the Executive, is evident — an approach that the Committee does
              not believe is best for Northern Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I mentioned the priorities set out for Northern
              Ireland in the framework document. They are found in annex B of
              the framework document and on page 273 of the inquiry report. A
              list of 100 topics is set out, which, as the framework document
              says, are</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;of immediate interest and will relate
              directly to the work of the Brussels office.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Brussels office is, apparently, to shadow
              the 58 high priority areas. The Committee does not see how that
              will be possible with only four staff in the office and given its
              other work.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Northern Ireland is a small region in Europe
              with limited resources. We cannot expect to influence or make a
              difference in every area of EU policy that affects Northern
              Ireland. Planning and co-ordination are needed if our resources
              are to be focused on the areas in which we can be sure of getting
              some return. The Committee does not feel that trying to cover 100
              topics will develop the focus needed to ensure successful returns
              from our limited resources, so we have made several
              recommendations that deal with the European Policy Co-ordination
              Unit and EU strategy. The number of topics should be reduced to
              achieve a more strategic focus that will reflect the
              distinctiveness of our situation, and that should be done by
              timely consultation with Assembly Committees and others, such as
              Members of the European Parliament.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We also recommend that the EU strategy be
              completed before the Assembly is dissolved for elections, and the
              need for greater detail on methodology, et cetera, should be
              addressed immediately. The strategy should be a regional one, not
              one narrowly focused on the needs of the Executive and
              Departments, and it should be developed and informed through wide
              consultation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Having dealt with OFMDFM’s approach, it may
              be appropriate to consider whether that approach can be successful
              in influencing policy and decisions that affect Northern Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I mentioned earlier, the UK is the member
              state that makes the decisions that affect Northern Ireland. If we
              wish to influence policy, we must first do that by influencing the
              UK policy line. Generally, the UK takes its policy line to the
              Council of Ministers’ meetings in Europe where the final EU
              policy decisions are taken, sometimes in conjunction with the
              European Parliament. UK Ministers are supported by the UK
              Permanent Representation with its staff of 140. Northern Ireland
              Departments must, therefore, liaise with their UK counterparts and
              ensure that our concerns are taken into account when the UK policy
              line is being determined. That is important when the policy is
              going to have a specific impact on us. The Committee was concerned
              to note that many of the Departments do not have the appropriate
              contacts in place.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The concordats that I mentioned make provision
              for Northern Ireland Ministers to attend the relevant Council of
              Ministers’ meetings in Brussels, and Ministers from the other
              devolved regions use that privilege extensively. On occasion, the
              Scottish Ministers have even led the UK delegation. The Committee
              was concerned, therefore, to find that the only Northern Ireland
              Minister to attend a Council of Ministers’ meeting has been Brid&nbsp;Rodgers
              and recommends that every effort be made to ensure the attendance
              of our Ministers at relevant Council meetings, especially when
              policy or legislation is being discussed that will affect Northern
              Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the subject of influencing EU policy, the
              Committee noted the evidence that suggests that there are ways to
              influence EU policy, other than by the formal London route.
              Informal networking, especially with other regions or consortia
              with similar concerns, can prove very effective, if they do not
              contradict or go against the UK policy line.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are several points of entry, but such
              informal networks require long-term commitment, collective effort,
              co-ordination and a willingness to actively engage with
              non-Government partners. It would appear from the evidence
              received by the Committee of the Centre that such informal
              networks and methods of influencing are being ignored at the
              expense of the formal, structured Government channels.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1.15 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee makes several recommendations to
              deal with the issue of networking. First, it looked at the
              individuals and organisations with a formal role to play. That
              includes the MEPs, the Assembly and the Northern Ireland
              representatives on the Committee of the Regions and the European
              Economic and Social Committee.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee recommends that formal structures
              be put in place to ensure regular communication and networking.
              The MEPs, the Committee of the Regions and the Economic and Social
              Committee members all have an important role to play in Europe,
              detailed knowledge of what is happening and, most importantly,
              strategically important contacts. For example, our three MEPs can,
              and have, come together, despite their diverging political
              backgrounds, to work to achieve the best for Northern Ireland, and
              they have had considerable success.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee acknowledges that the Office of
              the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister has made some
              attempts to bring all the major players together, but those
              attempts do not appear to have been successful. The Committee
              would refer OFMDFM to the work of the Scottish Executive in
              creating the European Elected Members Information Liaison and
              Exchange (EMILE). That is a structure set up by the Scottish
              Executive, which regularly brings together all relevant parties
              and individuals who have a formal role to discuss European issues
              and share information. It involves the Scottish Executive, the
              Scottish Parliament, MEPs and Scotland’s representatives on the
              Committee of the Regions and the European Economic and Social
              Committee. The Committee would like a similar group to be
              established in Northern Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee would also like structures to be
              put in place to ensure that networking occurs among informal
              players such as local government, the social partners and
              organisations such as the Northern Ireland Centre in Europe. The
              Committee notes that the Programme for Government 2001-02 made
              reference to a forum for Europe. That has been omitted from the
              latest Programme for Government. Although the Committee does not
              see the need for an elaborate structure, such as that of the Civic
              Forum, it recommends that some form of improving communication and
              networking with the informal parties be put in place.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The recommendations that deal with networking
              are especially important, given that the evidence gathered during
              the Committee’s inquiry showed that many of the non-Government
              bodies and local government representatives expressed concerns
              that relations within the European Union were conducted on an
              unco-ordinated and ad hoc basis, with little or no communication
              on what was happening.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee considered ways to address what
              it thought of as the shortcomings of OFMDFM. In summary, the areas
              that the Committee was most concerned about include: the lack of
              awareness by non-Government bodies on the approach; the lack of
              communications and consultation by OFMDFM; the narrow focus of the
              European Policy and Co-ordination Unit on the needs of the
              Executive, rather than on the region of Northern Ireland; the need
              for greater clarity in those important areas; and the delay in
              developing the EU strategy.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee’s report makes several
              recommendations to deal with shortcomings, which I have mentioned.
              However, it makes two further recommendations of a structural
              nature, which it believes will improve the situation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First, the European Policy and Co-ordination
              Unit should be a free-standing unit within OFMDFM, not a part of
              the Economic Policy Unit. European affairs are sufficiently
              important to justify a free-standing unit. It should also be
              properly resourced to enable it to carry out its wide-ranging and
              varied responsibilities. A budget of £163,000 and four staff
              working under a director who has other responsibilities is
              insufficient to enable the unit to carry out its duties. The
              Committee suspects that that under-resourcing leads to missed
              deadlines, lack of consultation and a focus on the official
              channels of communication.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second major change that the Committee
              recommends on the structure of OFMDFM concerns the remit of the
              junior Ministers. Several witnesses suggested that Northern
              Ireland should have a Minister, or junior Minister, for Europe.
              The Committee considers that there is some merit in that. Although
              there is nothing in the Northern Ireland Act 1998 to prevent the
              nomination of one of the junior Ministers to take a lead role in
              one policy area, the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister
              have taken the position that the junior Ministers must act
              jointly. The Committee, however, recommends that one junior
              Minister should take a lead role for European affairs.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That would be pivotal if the Office of the
              First Minister and the Deputy First Minister were to address
              issues such as the widespread perception of an unco-ordinated and
              ad hoc approach.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Post-devolution, Northern Ireland has the
              ability to develop its own strategies and policies, which differs
              from the pre-devolution period when policy was established in
              London. The direct engagement of officials with Europe — with
              the exception of the Department of Finance and Personnel on
              funding and the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development
              — was limited. The Committee thinks that a more proactive
              approach should now be taken to build capacity in Departments and
              in the Assembly in order to become engaged in European issues.
              When junior Minister Denis Haughey gave evidence to the Committee,
              he agreed with that point. He said that</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;It takes considerable time to build
              capacity in that machine [the Civil Service] and to reorient it so
              that it begins to think in ways which have not been natural for
              about a quarter of a century.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The evidence received by the Committee points
              to secondments as being one of the most effective ways to build
              capacity. The Committee was, therefore, alarmed at some of the
              information available on secondment. Despite its importance, very
              few people are currently on secondment. More importantly, it
              appears that, on return from secondment, little use is made of
              newly acquired skills. During its inquiry, the Committee examined
              the secondment policies of the Scottish Executive and the Welsh
              Assembly. The Scottish Executive have put aside a substantial
              budget in order to allow up to 12 secondments each year. The Welsh
              Assembly has gone a step further by ensuring that secondments can
              be made from the non-Government sector. That is another example of
              partnership and a co-operative approach that seems to be missing
              from the Northern Ireland approach.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, the Committee notes that a secondment
              policy is being developed, and it looks forward to receiving it.
              The Committee expects that the recommendations on secondments in
              its report will be taken on board. The recommendations include:
              long-term secondments of two to three years, and short-term
              secondments; full use being made of the experience and skills
              gained on return; enhanced promotional opportunities for long-term
              secondees in order to attract high-quality candidates, and to
              provide a reward for the disruption to the secondee and to his or
              her family; central funding to be put in place to cover
              departmental costs, because Departments must pick up the
              secondment costs at present, which is not encouraging and is often
              seen as a disincentive to allowing staff to go on EU secondments;
              and funding for non-Government secondments.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Northern Ireland has several outstanding EU
              Directives that have not been transposed, and we could soon face
              fines for non-compliance. Recently, Italy had fines of up to
              £50,000 each day for non-compliance. Any such fines will be taken
              out of the Northern Ireland Budget. The Committee for the
              Environment specifically highlighted that issue. Northern Ireland
              seems to experience most problems with environmental EU
              Directives. However, Mr Haughey indicated to the Committee that
              many problems had arisen during direct rule.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Office of the First Minister and the Deputy
              First Minister has a core responsibility to ensure that
              Departments implement EU Directives, and it has created a database
              in order to keep track of that implementation. The Committee
              recommends that the database be brought up to date and be shared
              with the Assembly and the relevant Committees. The Committee
              welcomes a recent meeting between the Committee for the
              Environment and the Minister of the Environment, which brought
              that Committee up to speed on the current status of EU Directives.
              Furthermore, the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First
              Minister should be working upstream and should be aware of EU
              Directives as they are being developed. It should be able to
              provide the Assembly with a 12-to-18-month forward programme of
              any EU legislation that it is expected to implement. Each
              Department should brief its Committee fully on current and future
              EU Directives, develop an implementation timetable and provide
              information on any likely infraction procedures.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee considered its own role, as well
              as asking for the opinions of the Statutory Committees. The main
              issue that was highlighted by Committees was lack of information
              and communication from the relevant Departments on EU issues,
              particularly on Directives. It is important to provide
              high-quality, relevant and timely information. When making
              decisions on EU issues or attempting to influence a particular
              point, it is essential that the correct information be available.
              Given that matters are moving so fast in Europe, it is important
              to ensure that information is up to date.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Despite matters moving so fast in Europe, it
              can take two to three years for a policy or law to move from the
              discussion stage in the European Commission to a decision that
              either the Council of Ministers or the European Parliament, or
              both, are ready to endorse and agree. Therefore, it is important
              to work upstream and to be prepared for new issues that may not
              come into effect for another two or three years.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Despite having a co-ordination role in a
              cross-departmental area, the Office of the First Minister and the
              Deputy First Minister has made it clear that it is not its role to
              ensure that Departments provide timely, clear and accurate
              information to Committees. Although it is not the role of the
              Committee of the Centre to say how other Departments should
              operate, the Committee nevertheless urges those Departments to put
              in place structures to ensure that Committees are kept informed
              both on current developments and on issues that may be two to
              three years upstream. The Committee also urges Statutory
              Committees to ensure that such structures are put in place.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee recommends that, in its
              co-ordinating role, the Office of the First Minister and the
              Deputy First Minister establishes a central resource that brings
              together all relevant information on EU issues and explains their
              context and implications. Indeed, many of the non-governmental
              organisations also asked for such a resource to be made available
              to them. As the Federation of Small Businesses said:</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;However late in the day policies come to
              the political table, they are coming to the business table even
              later.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee also recommends that the Assembly
              take a more proactive role and that the Assembly Commission
              consider the costs and the benefits of staffing an Assembly
              information desk in Brussels, which several Statutory Committees
              suggested. There may be merit in exploring whether a joint office
              could be set up with Scotland, which is also considering a similar
              project.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Alternatively, such an office could be based in
              the Office of the Northern Ireland Executive in Brussels. It is
              unlikely that the Brussels office could provide the necessary
              level of service to the Assembly and its Committees. By that I
              mean information to aid them in the scrutiny of the work of the
              Executive and Departments in European affairs. It is, after all,
              an office for the Executive, not the Assembly.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee also recommends that the Assembly’s
              research and library service develops its specialist service to
              assist the Committees in taking a more proactive role in dealing
              with EU legislation and policy. Another proactive measure, again
              suggested by the Statutory Committees, is that Members should
              receive EU familiarisation training specifically based around
              their Statutory Committee responsibilities.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The final recommendation dealing with the
              Assembly concerns the role of the Committee of the Centre. The
              Committee considered in detail and spent considerable time
              debating its own structures and role. The Committee has a wide
              remit, and the area of EU affairs is only one item within that.
              The Committee has found it impossible to devote sufficient time to
              EU affairs.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition, the evidence from many diverse
              organisations, ranging from the academic sector to the business
              sector, suggests that the lack of a dedicated European affairs
              committee within the Assembly is seen as a weakness in allowing
              full scrutiny of cross-cutting EU policies and legislation. For
              example, the Committee has not had time to devote to the ongoing
              Future of Europe debate — a debate that may change the role of
              regional authorities in Europe. Furthermore, much of the evidence
              suggests that an EU affairs committee could provide the focal
              point for the concerns of local groups and organisations involved
              in Europe. It could provide an important two-way link between the
              MEPs, as representatives of the European Parliament, and Members
              of the Assembly.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After much consideration and some frank
              discussions, the Committee agreed that there should be a dedicated
              Standing Committee on EU affairs. However, the Committee
              recognises that the practicalities of establishing such a
              committee means that it is unlikely to occur within the lifetime
              of this Assembly. In the interim, the Committee will establish a
              subcommittee to consider in detail the remit, workload and
              membership of such a Committee.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I conclude — Members will be glad to hear —
              by making a final reference to what the Committee hopes will be
              achieved if the recommendations in this report are implemented by
              all concerned, and not only by the Office of the First Minister
              and the Deputy First Minister.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Throughout the inquiry, the Committee focused
              on the approach being taken and debated whether that approach was
              the best for Northern Ireland. As I have already made clear, the
              Committee is not convinced that it is. At present, the Office of
              the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister’s approach is
              narrow. It deals with the needs of the Executive and the
              Departments and is centred on using formal channels at the expense
              of informal networks.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee believes that its
              recommendations, if implemented, will result in a professional,
              effective and co-operative approach to Europe. Such an approach
              will involve not only the formal players — the Executive, the
              Assembly and the MEPs — but also local government and
              non-governmental bodies.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It will make use of the vast experience of
              Europe that exists outside Government. It will build institutional
              capacity and will focus on gaining maximum returns for what is
              essentially — in an EU context — a small region with limited
              resources. I therefore recommend the report to the Assembly.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not intend to introduce a time limit at
              this stage, but I would be grateful if Members would limit their
              speeches to 10&nbsp;minutes.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr K Robinson:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the report and commend it to the
              Assembly. Its 43&nbsp;recommendations and over 300&nbsp;pages
              reflect our enthusiasm for the task. I hope that it also reflects
              the detail of our investigation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I congratulate the Chairperson on the
              businesslike manner in which he chaired the meetings, irrespective
              of which city we found ourselves in. I also express my
              appreciation to the Principal Clerk, the Committee Clerks and
              their colleagues for the professional and patient manner in which
              they approached the task; not forgetting the invaluable advice
              given by our researcher and our adviser.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This report, if endorsed by the Assembly, will
              represent a significant step forward by Northern&nbsp;Ireland plc
              in its relationship with the EU and its institutions. Sometimes,
              when dealing with Europe, it is possible to feel like the English
              tourist who arrived in Ballymena, asked the way to Antrim, and was
              told &quot;If I were you I would not start from here&quot;. There
              may be other reasons for not wanting to go to Antrim, but we will
              not go into those. I am sure that Antrim is a delightful place,
              and I am sure that you will speak up for it, Mr Deputy Speaker.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To date, as highlighted in the document, most
              contacts have centred on the financial largesse of the EU in its
              funding of agricultural, structural or peace and reconciliation
              schemes. Until now, Northern Ireland has been a beneficiary of
              funding that has been, in general, designed to overcome our
              distinctive, historical and economic problems. Those days will
              cease in 2006, which will coincide with the enlargement of the
              community. Those two events should encourage the Assembly and this
              region to plan ahead in an inclusive and coherent manner. We must
              learn to become selective if we are to become effective.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The recommendations in the report are a
              signpost, which, if followed, will enable the whole community to
              benefit from the opportunities that an enlarged Europe will bring.
              They will also allow us to deal more effectively with the threats
              that such a change could bring.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In our approach to this investigation we chose
              to map out how EU policy might be influenced. To help us to put
              this vital aspect of the report into context, we visited our
              sister institutions, which had already evolved their own
              distinctive approach mechanisms to the EU.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The House of Commons European Scrutiny
              Committee, the House of Lords European Scrutiny Committee and the
              Scottish Parliament identified key points and critical stages at
              which EU policy might be positively influenced. The common factor
              indicated by all was the primacy of the member state. Therefore,
              it is vital that, as highlighted in Recommendation&nbsp;2,
              linkages between the Whitehall Departments, Northern Ireland
              Departments and the corresponding Assembly Committees be in place.
              Dare I suggest that they be in place by September&nbsp;2002?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Equally important is recommendation&nbsp;8,
              which states that</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;structures are put in place which ensure
              that the Departments engage at an early stage with the relevant
              Assembly Committees in areas where a distinct policy need and
              position for Northern Ireland is being considered.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Chairperson drew attention to that vital
              and fundamental point.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The need is reinforced by
              recommendation&nbsp;12, which states that advice and guidance
              could be provided via a contact point in each Department to its
              corresponding Assembly Committee and other interested parties.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recommendation&nbsp;14 builds upon that more
              productive approach and suggests that an Assembly information desk
              be set up in Brussels. Many who submitted evidence favoured the
              idea, including those from three Committees of the Assembly.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The advent of the devolved institution has
              presented us with an opportunity — after 30&nbsp;years of
              relative inertia — to influence EU policy. Given that 80% of the
              Programme for Government is affected by EU policy and 60% of
              Northern Ireland legislation emanates from Brussels, that is
              vital.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The experiences of the Scottish, Catalonian and
              Flemish regional representatives point firmly to the necessity of
              using formal and informal networks in a planned and coherent
              manner. They also highlighted the need to focus selectively on
              areas in which results can be obtained — an approach that I have
              characterised as being &quot;selective to be effective&quot;,
              which encapsulates the essence of what must be done.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That approach relies on the willingness of the
              Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister and all
              other Departments to accept the principle of inclusiveness by
              incorporating the existing skills and knowledge that
              non-governmental organisations have developed in European matters.
              That wealth of experience and reservoir of information must be
              tapped into. That approach found widespread support from
              consultees, which the Committee highlights in recommendations 7,
              9, 11, 23 and 24.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recommendation 29 refers to co-ordinated
              networking and access to the Brussels office by organisations such
              as the Northern Ireland Centre in Europe (NICE), local government
              and non-governmental organisations. All our contacts, whether
              regional observers or not, pointed to the need to involve a range
              of key players in the task of influencing the EU policy makers as
              far upstream as possible. Mr Nicholson, in his discussions with
              the Committee, also pointed out the need to monitor the progress
              of the policies as they come downstream, as they constantly change
              due to pressure from other interest groups and lobbyists before
              emerging as fully-fledged Directives.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee also favoured the involvement of
              Assembly Members and civil servants in a programme to raise
              awareness of EU matters. It was encouraged to develop strong
              policies to organise secondments by those to whom it spoke in
              Brussels and Edinburgh. Given the backlog that Northern Ireland
              has inherited, the Committee felt that the fast-tracking of staff
              for short-term secondments and careful placement to maximise, on
              their return to Northern Ireland, the benefits of their experience
              should be investigated thoroughly in order to make the process as
              worthwhile as possible, both to the participants and the
              Administration. Those thoughts are contained in recommendations
              37, 38 and 39.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the Committee’s consultations, concern
              was expressed that the situation was one of reactive drift, in
              which responses were tempered to head off infraction proceedings,
              to dispense EU funding and to introduce the necessary legislation
              to comply with EU Directives. The Committee is convinced that a
              proactive framework must be established at all levels. It is no
              longer a &quot;can do&quot; situation; it is a &quot;must do&quot;
              scenario in which direction must be given. The Committee’s
              conclusion, which is shared by many contributors, is that a junior
              Minister must be given responsibility for EU matters. That vital
              step must be implemented sooner rather than later. It may be
              reinforced in the interim by the formation of a subcommittee of
              the Committee of the Centre to focus on EU issues. My preference
              is that the opportunity to form a European affairs committee
              should be a central consideration of any review of current
              practice in the Administration, and that is envisaged in
              recommendations 10 and 26.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the establishment of the European
              Policy Co-Ordination Unit but agree with recommendation 24 that it
              must be properly resourced if it is to become effective.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the Committee’s consultation with
              other regional representatives, it was apparent that they all
              compile formal and informal lists of contacts that may be useful
              to them for selective and continuous lobbying. It is vital that
              Northern Ireland develop such a comprehensive list of sympathetic
              and influential movers and shakers. A co-operative and proactive
              approach, inclusive of governmental contacts, is suggested in
              recommendations 29 and 31.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The role, influence and expertise of MEPs must
              also be connected to everything that I have said. I was not
              convinced that any or all of them were being actively sought out
              regularly. The impression that I was given was that, in a crisis,
              MEPs become central figures, but that once the crisis is over they
              become marginalized and bureaucracy takes over once more.
              Recommendations 17, 23 and 34 draw attention to that important
              point. With the enlargement of the EU, this will become a critical
              consideration. A community of such a size requires less
              bureaucracy and more democracy if the machine is not to grind to a
              halt.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The flow of vital information, both upwards and
              downwards in the system, is crucial to influencing issues at an
              early stage. Recommendations 41 and 42 refer to explanatory
              memoranda from the Cabinet Office being shared with the Assembly,
              its relevant Committees and, in part, with other non-Government
              interests. Those memoranda are worthy of scrutiny.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Mr Speaker in the Chair)</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The centralisation of resource capabilities
              referred to in recommendations 4, 5 and 13 is a useful method of
              ensuring that existing and expected information and impacts are
              set in a meaningful context. That will better inform people about
              the implications, whether they be opportunities or threats.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Throughout the deliberations of the Committee,
              there was a great deal of cross-party agreement and co-operation.
              We can all see how fundamental and central this aspect of the life
              of the Assembly is in dealing with European matters. We cannot
              afford not to implement the key recommendations in the report, and
              I appeal to Members to proactively support the drive that the
              Committee has set before the House — <i>[Interruption]</i> —
              in its report.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr McDonnell:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I apologise sincerely for that interruption. It
              was a wake-up call, and I got more than I bargained for.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the report and its recommendations. I
              will start where my Colleague Ken Robinson left off, by reusing
              the words &quot;fundamental&quot; and &quot;central&quot;. We have
              all accepted that Europe has had a massive influence on our lives,
              and everyone would agree that that influence has mostly been for
              the better. Many people in our community are very grateful to
              Europe for the support of the peace and reconciliation fund. That
              is only one example.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the core of the report — and this is an
              issue for the Assembly today, tomorrow, next week and next year
              — is the seriousness with which we want to approach the European
              Union and with which we want it to take us. How seriously do we
              want to regard the major influence on our lives that the European
              Union has become?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Until now, Europe has been seen as a honeypot;
              a place where funding — sometimes soft funding — could be
              found. Europe has been a source of cash and, unfortunately, it has
              been viewed as a bit like Santa Claus at Christmas. Our
              participation was passive and receptive in many ways as we held
              out the bowl for the funds, whether regional funding, social
              development funding or other types. We were very receptive to that
              bounty. However, that was a short-term approach. It enabled us to
              get back on our feet after some very difficult years, but we must
              now move on and develop a more mature relationship with Europe. We
              must be able to influence the evolution of European Union policies
              and strategies at a much earlier stage. As some of my Colleagues
              suggested earlier, we should be influencing policies not only at
              the early stages, but throughout their evolution and
              implementation. We must do that in a proactive way, compared to
              our previous passive approach.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the European context, some of us have been
              taught a salutary lesson in how the drift and estrangement of the
              population in Southern Ireland created circumstances in which the
              public felt uninvolved — to the point that they voted against
              the Nice Treaty, which was unfortunate. We do not want to get to
              that stage, and I do not think that we will if we take this
              report, and some of the recommendations emerging from it, with the
              seriousness that it merits.</p>
              <i>

              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When we discuss Europe, parties could disagree
              on many points — Ken Robinson touched wisely and informatively
              on that matter. As the report was evolving, there was broad
              consensus, and the Committee sought, for the large part, a common
              ground. Despite Northern Ireland’s limited population of 1·6
              million or 1·7 million, there was a realisation that the Assembly
              could influence Europe and have access to the key players there.
              That was brought home to the Committee during its visit to
              Brussels. We realised that we could copy some of the best practice
              that we saw, and in that context I was particularly impressed with
              the Scottish system’s organisation and experience. I have no
              doubt that the Scottish representation dressed up their
              experiences and did not tell us about all their difficulties, but
              they produced a positive and efficient image. We will need to
              influence Europe as enlargement unfolds — if we do not,
              enlargement will swallow us up. It is one thing to be a region
              with a population of 1·6 million or 1·7 million in a community
              of approximately 300 million, but if the community’s population
              almost doubles, to over 500 million, Northern Ireland will be a
              very small fish indeed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The big issue is the need for greater contact
              with, and engagement in, Europe. We need to get Northern Ireland
              Ministers to Europe, attending meetings where possible. In that
              context, the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development had
              useful contact with Europe during the recent agriculture crises.
              During the inquiry, the Committee felt that all our Ministers
              should find ways to attend European Council meetings. We saw the
              need to connect the Assembly with Europe. We do not wish the
              report to be the beginning and end of that — we want a regular
              drip feed to the Assembly from Europe, and from the Assembly, so
              that it can influence Europe.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Colleagues mentioned the need for a European
              affairs committee. Although the Committee is aware of some of the
              difficulties that may be created, and the fact that Members are
              already stretched in their attempts to cover all the current
              Committees, members agreed that the vacuum must be filled. We need
              to take Europe seriously. I will not dwell on that at length, but
              I have already mentioned the possible designation of a Minister or
              junior Minister with a European affairs brief. Local government
              organisations, industry and business must be better connected.
              Overall, we need to establish a multi-level, multifaceted approach
              to Europe. Although the Committee welcomed the opening of an
              office in Brussels, it saw it as much too narrow, and more
              bureaucratic than political. We need a wider approach, which is
              well co-ordinated and involves all our players. The Committee
              accepts readily that the Executive are the big player and that
              individual Ministers and Departments follow very closely.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, we emphasise — and I am perhaps
              repeating what has been mentioned already — that the Assembly
              does have a role to play in European affairs and should be
              involved in the Office of the Northern Ireland Executive in
              Brussels. We realise that Members of the European Parliament have
              considerable influence and that there should be some method to
              facilitate regular contact with them. Members of the Committee of
              the Regions should be linked into some type of formal or informal
              network. In addition, we could make contact with the European
              Economic and Social Committee. There is also, of course, the wider
              community.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the Committee carried out its inquiry, it
              discovered an obvious need to get out of the silos — I am
              thinking especially about the various Government Departments —
              and make partnership and co-operation work on European issues, in
              the interest of our whole community. A comprehensive approach
              would ensure that we achieve the maximum influence in Europe and
              receive the maximum benefits from it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There appeared to be a laissez-faire attitude
              in many Departments and sections of Government. Often, matters
              were allowed to drift, and because European issues sometimes had
              to be dealt with by several Departments, the process was like
              musical chairs — everyone deferred to someone else.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must move from that passive attitude into a
              proactive, dare I say, aggressive approach to Europe. We have seen
              what other nations have done — and we only have to look South of
              the border to see what the Irish Republic has done as regards its
              influence in Europe. Equally, the inquiry noticed that some
              regions had dramatically influenced Europe and had served their
              own interests extremely well.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I mentioned earlier, we need a network to
              gather information that goes beyond the formal arrangements. I was
              particularly impressed that, even though there are few secondments
              from Northern Ireland to Europe, several natives who have been
              placed in Brussels, or who have worked there, have a considerable
              resource of information and influence. Therefore they must be
              included in any informal network that we create.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If I could dwell for a moment on the secondment
              of staff — <i>[Interruption].</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am nearly finished. I suggest that we take
              seriously the opportunity to second staff to Europe. I will leave
              it at that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee was concerned about the Northern
              Ireland Centre in Europe, which has done a wonderful job over the
              years. However, once again I will not dwell on that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Overall, the report is an excellent initial
              work of the Committee, and we will have to revisit this subject
              from time to time and deal with many of the recommendations in
              greater detail. We will also have to examine the cost implications
              of the recommendations. It would be foolish to publish the report
              today; blandly accept all the recommendations; put a pink ribbon
              round it, and go away. We must review the issue.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some Colleagues are concerned that the word
              &quot;accepts&quot; in the amendment is a bit stronger than the
              word &quot;notes&quot;, but I would be comfortable with the
              amendment if it were set in the context of revisiting the subject
              and examining each recommendation in greater depth.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr C Murphy:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Go raibh maith agat, a LeasCheann Comhairle. I
              too support the report. I commend the Committee for the work that
              has been done. I thank the Clerks, the Committee staff and
              research staff who ably assisted us. It was a very interesting and
              worthwhile exercise, and the vast scope of the report and the
              number of recommendations made showed how seriously the Committee
              took its work and how much interest there was in the subject.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report, and the evidence contained in it,
              clearly demonstrate the absence of a coherent strategy in our
              dealings with Europe. The Office of the First Minister and the
              Deputy First Minister has yet to put in place a co-ordinated
              approach to the EU, both within the Assembly’s jurisdiction and
              across the islands, through the all-Ireland implementation bodies
              and the North/South Ministerial Council. That was probably best
              displayed by the lack of co-ordination with other stakeholders in
              going forward with the Office of the Northern Ireland Executive in
              Brussels. Ken Robinson and Alisdair McDonnell referred to the
              Committee’s broad consensus in agreeing the recommendations and
              the approach needed by the Assembly to Europe. That is correct.
              Regardless of whether one is a Euro-sceptic, a Europhile, or
              shares one of the many opinions between those positions, the
              majority of our legislation emanates from Europe. That has a
              massive impact on how we do our business here.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is clear from the report and our
              investigation that we need early warning on EU legislative
              proposals and infraction proceedings that will affect us. We must
              know which EU Directives we need to act on and their timetables
              for implementation. We can see the risk with respect to the
              environmental Directives, in particular, and the serious potential
              to impose financial penalties on us.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly must guard against the risk that
              its approach to the EU might become merely an adjunct to that of
              the British Labour Party, which is working its way through
              Westminster, Scotland and Wales. Regardless of which side of the
              House they come from, many Members agree that an individual,
              distinct approach would benefit us.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another weakness that I identified in the
              approach from OFMDFM — and it emerges in some of the evidence of
              the report — is the failure to develop an all-Ireland approach
              to EU matters. Unlike many member states, we have a unique
              Executive and institutional link to another member state. Not only
              should we benefit and learn from the success of the South in its
              dealings with the European Union, but in our approach to the
              European Union we should reflect our formal institutional and
              Executive link to the South. I hope that the idea and development
              of a common strategy could be advanced at North/South Ministerial
              Council level.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the idea of setting up a Standing
              Committee on EU affairs. As a result of our inquiry and our
              examination of how other institutions’ EU Committees have
              operated, there is a strong argument for a Committee with
              responsibility for both the scrutiny of important legislation and
              conducting broad inquiries into EU matters and their impact on
              Northern Ireland affairs. However, given the pressure that there
              is on the Assembly’s Committee system, the membership and
              attendance of our Committees and the number of Committees and Ad
              Hoc Committees, we must ensure that we do not increase that
              stress. We must ensure that we do not create a Committee that
              cannot function due to the workload of other Committees. It must
              be an effective Committee; it must be able to deal effectively
              with, and scrutinise, our relationship with the EU and that
              between the Executive and the EU.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I regret to say that the lack of strategic
              planning by OFMDFM appears to have been a feature of its approach.
              That is reflected in many of the recommendations and in much of
              the commentary of previous Members who spoke. A lack of
              communication has been another regrettable feature. Those features
              must be reversed. I accept the amendment to change the report and
              its recommendations from being &quot;noted&quot; to being
              &quot;accepted&quot; by the Executive.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report must be taken seriously, because
              reports can be absorbed without an effective adoption of the
              recommendations therein. The report was a serious attempt to look,
              comment and reflect on our relationship with the EU. It was an
              attempt to recommend to the Executive what the Committee feels
              should be done about that relationship. That must be done if we
              are to have an effective relationship with the EU that would
              benefit not only those whom we represent in the North, but
              everyone on the island, through all-Ireland institutional links.

              Investment was carrying out its investigation into energy it
              realised the impact that the EU was having on energy policy
              throughout Europe, including the regions. The Committee receives
              all European Directives that affect it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was a member of the Committee of the Regions
              for several years, albeit as an alternate. However, it was a
              significant role. I congratulate those who have been newly
              appointed to the Committee from Northern Ireland and wish them
              well during their period in office.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee of the Centre’s recommendations
              are very welcome. Only two political parties from here are
              involved in the membership of the Committee of the Regions. Four
              members, two full members and two alternates, would make it
              broader. In present Assembly circumstances it would include a
              Member from the DUP and a Member from Sinn Féin. The Assembly
              needs to take that on board.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am a voluntary member of the board of the
              Northern Ireland Centre in Europe (NICE), and I share the
              Committee’s concerns about the treatment of NICE. When we had an
              office in Brussels, the cost of running it was about one third of
              the cost of running the new office, and that needs to be
              considered. I do not resent the fact that money is being invested
              in such an important office, but it is essential that its work be
              monitored closely. The fact that the office costs three times more
              would be acceptable if there was clear evidence of greater
              achievements or a higher quality of work, but, going by the
              report, the Committee did not find such a quantum leap.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee expresses concerns that the
              experience of NICE has not been used or built on. As a voluntary
              member of that board I share those concerns, and it is time that
              they came out into the open, because the board has faced
              considerable problems recently.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Over the years NICE has built a substantial
              foundation of contacts, information, skills and knowledge that has
              been put at the disposal of the public and private sectors in
              Northern Ireland. The benefits from the organisation continue, yet
              there has not been a single contact from the head of the Executive’s
              Office in Brussels to discuss that experience or to seek benefit
              from it, despite the clear assurances given by the First Minister
              and the Deputy First Minister at the official opening. They stated
              clearly that the office would work in an open manner, co-operating
              and communicating with all sectors, and yet for an organisation
              that was established through a cross-party initiative, there has
              been absolute silence. That silence sends a clear and resounding
              message. How loudly it speaks of the attitude of some in the Civil
              Service. They have more than tripled the cost to taxpayers and
              have not even had the common courtesy to contact the organisation
              that has invested so much time and expertise.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It would be bad enough if it were simply a lack
              of courtesy. It is worse than that. Not only has the head of the
              Office of the Northern Ireland Executive in Brussels never
              contacted the board or the staff of NICE, but there is a clear
              pattern of behaviour that the Minister should take steps to change
              substantially. I also note that the Chairperson of the Committee,
              Mr Poots, recently asked in the House when NICE would begin to be
              treated in a more honourable way. I echo that question. A
              considerable amount of successful work was undertaken with
              genuine, constructive and positive motivation for the benefit of
              all in Northern Ireland. The attempt that was made to bury that
              work and cast NICE aside was despicable.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is time for the officials in that area to
              cease their petty-minded approach and meet with the staff of NICE,
              who have acted with integrity and character throughout this
              shameful period.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no doubt that Europe is having a
              greater impact on our everyday lives. I welcome the fact that
              Marks and Spencer in Belfast now has a counter that accepts the
              euro, and several other retail establishments in Northern Ireland
              are doing the same. The question is not whether the euro will be
              introduced in the UK but when. I hope that the Assembly can focus
              on the issues that are at hand concerning the development and
              enlargement of the European Union.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would like to thank the Clerk, the Committee
              and the specialist adviser for the work that they have put into
              the report, which I consider to be significant. I also want to put
              on record my thanks and support for the efforts of the junior
              Minister, Mr Haughey. If the Assembly is to nominate a Minister
              for Europe, I cannot think of a better person.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall declare an interest. I am a former head
              of the European Commission office in Northern Ireland, and I
              remain actively involved in a variety of bodies concerned with
              Europe and Northern Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the report. It is obvious that a
              great deal of work has gone into it. It is excellent that the
              report opens up the European debate, which has, sadly, been in its
              infancy in Northern Ireland for far too long. It is timely, and
              its recommendations are very welcome. The Committee’s
              &quot;knuckle-rapping&quot; on the work of the Executive and
              OFMDFM and its approach to Northern Ireland is valuable, and its
              recommendations for changing that are very appropriate. <i>[Interruption].</p>

              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ms Morrice:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wish to consider the conclusions of the
              report. Dr McDonnell asked if we were taking the European Union
              seriously. I go further than that and openly criticise the
              Executive for not taking the European Union seriously. The report
              suggests that the Executive should get its European house in order
              and realise that it is not a chateau for the elite in the
              Executive and Government Departments.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It should be an open house for all members of
              the public and the various sectors in Northern Ireland. That has
              been totally disregarded. There has been a lack of communication
              and consultation with the experts in that area. The three MEPs are
              pretty long in the tooth and long in understanding European Union
              affairs, yet they have not been properly consulted. Members of the
              Committee of the Regions, members of the Economic and Social
              Committee, non-governmental organisations, farming unions, trade
              unions and business sectors are not being properly consulted on
              what we should be doing on European Union affairs. Why is that
              being ignored? What sort of attitude is there in Government
              Departments and in the Executive that those issues are being
              ignored, and people’s expertise is being ignored?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to quote some comments, which I found
              incredible, made by officials from OFMDFM justifying the problems
              that they have in trying to convince Departments to get involved
              in European affairs. One of them said that</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;A major problem is that many Departments
              have not yet realised that they need our services, and that they
              need to get into Europe.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Wait a minute. Think about that. It is said
              that many Departments have not realised that they need to get into
              Europe. First, could someone please tell those people that we are
              in Europe now. Secondly, we have been in Europe since 1973. Where
              have those civil servants been since 1973 if they did not realise
              that we were already in Europe?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is stated that officials noted that
              resources were needed. That comment relates to the implementation
              of Directives. As Members know, there has been a backlog of
              Directives, especially in relation to the environment. As the
              Chairperson said, it is costing the Italians around £50,000 a
              day. I would love a response from the Ministers — <i>[Interruption].</p>

              from Ministers stating how much the backlog of Directives is
              costing Northern Ireland. Ministers are looking at monitoring
              that, but I would like to have a figure to see how much it is
              costing us because we do not have our house in order on
              implementing the Directives. The excuse is that</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I assume that refers to devolution. Another

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;It is difficult to obtain the necessary
              resources and legal expertise. We must solve this problem as
              quickly as possible.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is very good, but it is 25 years too late.
              We are talking about the legal expertise and resources necessary
              to implement Directives into the law of Northern Ireland. We were
              supposed to have that in place when we joined the European Union,
              and not so many years later. The excuses are legal expertise and
              resources, and I suppose that we should appreciate that those
              aspects are being recognised now. However, we have been in the
              European Union for a quarter of a century, and some people need to
              wake up to that fact.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall highlight a few valuable
              recommendations. There is the recommendation that a Standing
              Committee on European affairs should be established. Members may
              recall that the Committee that looked into the impact of
              devolution made that recommendation. But what happened about it?
              Zilch. When it came to the formation of the Committee of the
              Centre, it was assumed that we would have a committee on European
              affairs, a Minister on European affairs, a committee on equality
              and a Minister on equality. Suddenly the tables were turned, and
              we found ourselves with a Committee of the Centre and two junior
              Ministers covering the works. How can we possibly take Europe
              seriously if it is done in that way? We back the recommendation to
              have a Standing Committee.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Greater use of expertise is vital. The
              expertise of all the representatives in the European scene is
              important, as well as the expertise in non-governmental areas and
              that of the people who have been working with European peace
              money, the business sector and the trade unions. It is vital for
              that expertise to be channelled properly.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another issue is ministerial attendance. The
              Committee is disappointed that we are losing out on key
              opportunities to influence European policy-making. How long have
              we been doing that? Ministers from Northern Ireland should be at
              those ministerial meetings.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2.15 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I want to add two more recommendations that I
              did not see in the report, and the Chairperson will hardly be
              surprised by that. Something has been ignored.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On this occasion it is not the euro, it is
              young people. Members will appreciate the influence of young
              people. The Executive have not done enough to get the debate on
              European awareness into the public domain in order to get the
              public more actively interested in European affairs — especially
              young people.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondments should not only be for executives
              or senior officials of the Departments. They should be for
              non-governmental organisations and they should be for young
              people. There is in-service training — <i>stages </i>— which
              is a superb course in the European Commission for graduates —
              that is what started me on the European road. Why is that sort of
              thing not being pushed to allow more young people to get involved?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I realise that I am running out of time, but I
              have much more to say. I want to look at departmental priorities.
              I was flabbergasted by the section at the end of the report in
              which Departments were asked to categorise their European Union
              affairs as high or medium priorities. I want to go through a few
              of those. The EQUAL programme and lifelong learning are only
              medium priorities for the Department for Employment and Learning.
              Access to environmental information is a medium priority for the
              Department of the Environment. Wait until you hear this — the
              Department for Social Development rates non-governmental
              organisations and the voluntary and community sector as medium
              priorities. Wow.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Economic and monetary union, as well as
              consumer protection are medium priorities for the Department of
              Enterprise, Trade and investment. Organic farming and food
              labelling are medium priorities for the Department of Agriculture
              and Rural Department. Last, but not least, the Department of
              Education only has two areas of responsibility for European
              affairs, and both are medium priority. What is going on? Does the
              Department of Education not realise that we are in Europe to stay?
              All those Departments should realise that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have had my say, although I would have liked
              longer. We have to start taking Europe seriously. Politics aside,
              we are in the business of doing what is good for Northern Ireland.
              Unless the parties in the Executive that are not interested in
              being a part of Europe are prepared to say that they want us to
              withdraw from it, they should be working hard to ensure that we
              reap the benefits and also offer our expertise to others in the
              European Union.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Paisley Jnr:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the debate, and I want to
              congratulate the Chairperson and Members of the Committee for
              producing such an extensive report. It is substantial and
              impressive. In the detail in which it has examined the topic, it
              is one of the most far-reaching reports published by the Assembly
              to date. It serves as an example of how an Assembly Committee —
              a non-Statutory Committee, by the way — holds the Government to
              account. More importantly, it finds the Government wanting on the
              key issues that they ought to have been dealing with in the past
              three years.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The inquiry caught OFMDFM napping on the
              serious and important issue of Europe, and the approach of the
              devolved Government to European issues. In the annex we have the
              first published paper by OFMDFM on European issues, which shows
              that the Committee was able to force the Government belatedly to
              respond to some of the key issues that have been before them for
              the past three years.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One got the impression from the OFMDFM
              submission that it was a case of bolting the stable door after the
              horse had gone. There seemed to be several issues that it was
              trying to catch up on or that might have been reported to it —
              not necessarily by Committees members. It appears that OFMDFM was
              trying to put a brave face on the situation, and to plug an
              embarrassing leak.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As Ms Morrice said, it is to be hoped that the
              report serves as a serious wake-up call to the Government here on
              how they intend to deal with Europe. If European policy is not
              scrutinised closely, European Directives will be imposed on
              Northern Ireland that are contrary to the will of our people. It
              is important that Northern Ireland has its say on those
              Directives, that when they are just ideas in the minds of
              bureaucrats and Eurocrats they are shaped according to our wishes.
              It is important that we have early warning and early influence in
              Europe. I agree with the Committee’s view that our Government
              must be proactive on Europe. The scathing criticisms in the report
              show that the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First
              Minister has been at best, reactive and, at worst — which is
              most of the time — inactive on European issues. A plush office
              in Brussels must not be the be-all and end-all of Government
              policy, but I get the impression that that is the role that the
              Northern Ireland Executive seek for themselves. They have ticked
              the box, they have an office in Brussels, but the Executive must
              do considerably more than that. It is to be hoped that they will
              start to deliver on some of the promises made, as there is very
              little to show for their work over the past three years.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Criticism of the Executive has been universal.
              They were not given the most auspicious of starts, given that when
              the Assembly travelled to Brussels in 1998, some members of Sinn
              Féin used the opportunity to attack the paymasters and to insult
              the people of Northern Ireland by their approach. The Executive
              could nevertheless have built on that low point, but unfortunately
              they have not done that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I refer to page 199 of the report and to the
              written submission of Mr Nigel Smyth, the director of the
              Confederation of British Industry (CBI) Northern Ireland. He
              states that</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;a number of key issues are of concern to
              the business community. These include the following: the lack of
              information on the existing Northern Ireland strategy towards, and
              activities focused at, the European Union; the apparently ad hoc
              and unfocused approach to European issues; the difference in
              governance arrangements between Northern Ireland and the European
              Union; and the additionality issues — just how important is it
              and how does it impact on Northern Ireland’s ability to access
              EU funds.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">CBI’s criticisms are echoed by the Federation
              of Small Businesses, which also made a written submission. Time
              forbids listing all its recommendations.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Both Ms Morrice and Mr Neeson noted some
              criticisms voiced by the Northern Ireland Centre in Europe (NICE).
              It is important to record the criticisms of Mr John Kennedy, the
              chief executive of NICE. His recommendations, on page 244 of the
              report, stressed that</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Existing approaches, which are based on
              the immediate administrative agendas of Departments, are not
              likely to realise the maximum potential. We believe that it is
              necessary to fundamentally review this approach and to build on
              the learning available.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are major gaps in the Executive’s
              approach to European issues.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Department of Agriculture and Regional
              Development must spend 46·7% of its budget according to European
              Directives and yet, it is clear to me as a member of the Committee
              for Agriculture and Regional Development, that it is difficult for
              Committee members to grasp some of the European issues that arise.
              That is because the Minister does not bring those issues to the
              Committee; officials relate them in an ad hoc fashion and on many
              occasions bounce them on the Committee. The Committee is told that
              if it does not act immediately the money will be lost, so there is
              no co-ordinated, strategic approach for dealing with money, for
              which we are accountable as public representatives.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All Committees must have a much more detailed
              knowledge of European Directives, the way in which they come to us
              and how the Government influence those Directives at the
              beginning. The report shows that all the Committees are concerned
              at the apparent lack of knowledge of the role of the European
              Union, and its extent, on our affairs. It is a serious criticism
              of the House and the institutions that have been established that
              there is no driving force to change that situation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In his submission the European Commission’s
              representative, Mr Jim Dougal said that he is prepared to arrange
              training seminars. However, it is not his job to do that — it is
              the job of the House and the officials here to put in place those
              recommendations and training mechanisms. We do not want to get our
              steer totally from the European Commission’s representative.
              Members may not necessarily share his agenda, which accords with
              that of the Commission, and it is important that we ensure that
              our approach is in the interests of the people whom we represent,
              rather than in the interests of the Commission with its own
              detailed agenda.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are some other criticisms to which I
              would like to refer. I note that only one MEP made a written
              submission to the report, although Jim Nicholson made himself
              available to the Committee for an extensive verbal briefing. Both
              MEPs had the same stark criticisms, and the Office of the First
              Minister and the Deputy First Minister must address those instead
              of just taking them on the chin, because they are serious. For
              example, in his submission on page 284 of the report, Dr Paisley
              said that he would like the Office of the First Minister and the
              Deputy First Minister</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Critically your committee inquiry should
              consider why there is no co-ordination between the Departments and
              the MEPs. There are no regular briefings and there is no strategic
              approach in general from the Executive. I continue to make
              approaches directly and receive the briefing papers that the
              Scottish, English and Welsh MEPs receive on behalf of the
              Government Departments there. Quite frankly the Northern Ireland
              Departments and the Executive are not at the same game. In fact,
              in my experience it is now more difficult to get information from
              the Northern Ireland Departments about European matters than at
              any previous time due to the defensive nature of the ministerial
              run Departments.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is a stark criticism, and, brushing aside
              its political content, it is a very serious administrative
              criticism, which the Office of the First and the Deputy First
              Ministers should address seriously. Ken Robinson, on behalf of the
              Ulster Unionist Party, also made that point, and I am happy to
              echo it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, I wish to draw Members’ attention to
              the comments of Mr John Simpson, Queen’s University and the
              Ulster Farmers’ Union, all of which make the same criticisms
              that there is neither the scrutiny, the strategic vision nor the
              proper policy approach to Europe that there should be. The
              Assembly is grateful to the Committee of the Centre for carrying
              out this brave task and for identifying the issues in the way in
              which it has.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Tourism Ireland Ltd has achieved its core
              objectives of being operational in 2002 and of launching and
              implementing a challenging international marketing campaign. In
              accordance with the direction of the North/South Ministerial
              Council, a corporate plan has been developed to guide the company
              through the period from 2002 to 2004.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr ONeill:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Is the Minister confident, given that the body’s
              full complement of staff is now in post and that it is fully
              operational, that all the views from all sectors of the tourism
              industry, North and South, will have adequate representation in
              Tourism Ireland Ltd?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There were industrial relations problems
              concerning staff who were transferring from Bord Fáilte in the
              Republic. Those problems have been resolved. A full complement of
              staff is being assembled in the Dublin office. The Coleraine
              office is in temporary accommodation at present. Five out of the
              possible 15 or 16 members of staff are in post. The remaining
              staff will be assembled between now and the autumn. It is hoped
              that the new Coleraine regional office will be available later
              this year, when all staff members will be in post. That is the
              current plan.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I assure the Member that although at the time
              of appointment to the board there was criticism that not every
              section of the tourist industry was represented — bearing in
              mind that we had to have a small operational board with the
              capability to start off a multimillion pound organisation — the
              views of all parts of the industry are now being taken on board.
              That is being done through the creation of groups involving
              industry representatives and Tourism Ireland Ltd representatives
              to work out the operational plans. All sections of the industry
              will be able to convey their views to the heart of the
              organisation and have those views reflected in future marketing
              campaigns.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member must, however, bear in mind that
              although there has been criticism in that respect, the significant
              achievements of creating a new organisation from scratch and
              starting its first marketing campaign, have taken place against
              the background of two of the worst events to have affected tourism
              on these islands in our lifetime — foot-and-mouth disease and
              the events of 11 September 2001. Tourism Ireland Ltd’s response
              has been positive, and I congratulate it.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the past three years my Department has
              developed an e-business strategy, including an Internet presence
              providing information directly to the public. We have also
              upgraded our IT infrastructure, completed a pilot study on
              electronic document and records management and developed a project
              in Companies Registry that has converted paper systems to
              electronic access. The Department intends to extend that approach
              to other areas.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr McDonnell:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Minister for those details of
              positive and obvious progress. The corporate strategic framework
              for electronic delivery of Government services specified that
              Departments would consult their customers to ensure that needs are
              addressed. Can the Minister outline any processes that businesses
              in his Department use to identify customers’ electronic services
              needs?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is significant potential in such
              processes. The first requirement is to understand customer needs,
              as the Member correctly identified. We must then ensure that both
              staff and customers understand the approach and are confident with
              the systems and the proposed changes. Provision of self-service
              facilities for customers, supported by a contact centre, is one
              project that we are following up. That should ensure a more
              joined-up approach, with delivery through various media: Internet,
              e-mail, fax and perhaps kiosks. It depends on what the service is
              and where it is required.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">An editorial board has been established, with
              responsibility for providing a customer-focused web presence for
              the Department. Exploiting knowledge management relies on
              maximising the corporate memory through good information use and
              management, of which an electronic record and document management
              system is an essential component.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I visited Companies Registry a few months ago
              and saw the records that are held there. Massive circular document
              holders are dug into the ground, and a huge amount of paper is
              collected. The office will be altered so that customers will be
              able to access much of that information electronically. Of course,
              it will be stored.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must remember that there are many legalities
              involved; companies are involved in court actions all the time.
              Therefore, we are grateful that we are making progress on giving
              legal effect to electronically generated materials. I am satisfied
              with the progress that is being made. A target has been set of
              ensuring that services and advice are offered not only via current
              methods, but by new methods, by the end of the e-business
              programme in 2005. By that time, all key services are to be
              available online. That is quite ambitious.</p>

              Investment has taken a great interest in the development of
              e-government. The Minister said that the Department had
              established targets. What monitoring procedures have been
              established to ensure that those targets are met?</p>
              <b>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A committee in the Department is charged with
              exactly that. A quarterly report informs me of the progress that
              has been made across all targets that the Department sets,
              including the development of e-government. That is entirely
              consistent with the commitments in the Programme for Government.
              The target date of 2005 is ambitious, but it will be worth it. The
              Committee is interested in e-government. Indeed, many services
              across Government and local government can be provided in that
              way, such as licence applications and the provision of
              information, which is where, for instance, kiosks and so on come
              in. They are very ambitious targets, but I assure the Member that
              monitoring is conducted on a rolling basis and quarterly reports
              are sent to me.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the Minister agree that the principal
              pitfall of e-government is the e-mail congestion that it creates?
              What steps are Departments taking to address the proliferation of
              an unnecessary duplication of e-mails in the Government machine?</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not sure whether it is generational, but
              the first thing that people seem to do on receiving an e-mail is
              to copy it in triplicate in hard copy. If I am aware of any
              particular problem, it is that one. People are still afraid that
              when material is transmitted electronically, it will run away
              unless it exists as hard copy. Perhaps I misread the expression on
              your face, Mr Speaker, but you give me the impression that you
              know what I am talking about. There is a substantial proliferation
              of e-mails — I see it in my office all the time. However, the
              problem is that in addition to those e-mails, there is also hard
              copy, or e-mails are automatically printed out as hard copy. One
              successful company in Northern Ireland makes the point that over
              one third of all e-mails are not answered, and it has employed
              people in Belfast and Londonderry to deal with that problem.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not have a technical answer to the Member’s
              question, but that will come with experience. When credit cards
              were first introduced, people were reluctant to use them. However,
              people are now familiar with credit cards, and some people have
              taken to them very well. We will all learn how to handle it.</p>

              comparative costs of electronic service delivery versus the cost

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have no current plans to publish comparative
              costs, because those matters are cross-departmental. The
              motivation for the provision of that type of information is not
              simply speed of transfer, and if it is managed properly, it has
              the potential to involve fewer people in the transmission of
              larger amounts of information. That is the rationale for
              undertaking it. I will take advice on the Member’s question and
              will write to him if such figures are available in detail in my
              Department. A central Government unit is charged with the process.
              Government-wide figures may be available, and I will inform the

              achieve that goal. Direct assistance is not offered towards
              companies’ investments overseas.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Do the Minister and his Department recognise
              that, when businesses express a wish to develop overseas as well
              as at home, it is an indication of a vibrant economy? Does he
              recognise that businesses do not necessarily require financial
              assistance, but back-up assistance to develop international links
              in order to improve their chances of bringing further investment
              and profitability to Northern Ireland?</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I recognise the Member’s point. The
              Department offers assistance in different ways. Invest Northern
              Ireland has several overseas offices, including one in the Dubai
              Internet City. Before Christmas, it opened an incubator centre in
              Boston, and it is hoped that a follow-up office will open in New
              York shortly.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those measures are designed to help companies
              that are establishing themselves in overseas markets. Primarily,
              of course, their objective is to sell their products and services
              in those markets. However, the Member touched on an issue that, as
              I have said before, Members must come to terms with. A growing
              number of our companies are acquiring, or entering into
              arrangements with, overseas companies. They have transferred a
              significant amount of manufacturing to those overseas locations on
              the grounds that it enables them to become more competitive and in
              some cases they send partially finished materials back to Northern
              Ireland for more added-value work. That is spreading across sector
              after sector.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To answer the Member’s question, the
              Department does not give money directly to companies to establish
              overseas offices. However, in helping companies generally, whether
              financially or through the provision of advice and other services,
              the establishment of overseas offices is a growing trend. It is an
              emotive issue. Therefore, as a community, we must make a judgement
              in the not-too-distant future on how we choose to deal with these
              matters. People see the establishment of overseas offices as the
              exporting of jobs; they see it as encouraging companies to move
              production facilities elsewhere. The Department does all that it
              can to avoid that, but the Member is correct to say that we must
              be extremely aware of the issue, and we must provide as much
              advice and assistance as possible in the manner that I indicated.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To what extent has InterTradeIreland been able
              to assist Northern Ireland companies to develop and expand their
              business in the Republic of Ireland?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">InterTradeIreland is designed to increase the
              amount of trade between the Republic and Northern Ireland, which
              it does in several ways. It also has objectives to improve the
              competitiveness of, and to measure, that trade. The first thing
              that the Department discovered is that the measurement of
              cross-border trade is one of the most difficult tasks, because the
              figures did not match. Work has been undertaken to set a benchmark
              to show the position from which we are starting.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Schemes have been introduced whereby graduates
              from Northern Ireland companies work in companies in the Republic,
              and vice versa, in order to exchange information. The Department
              has encouraged graduates to join companies to help them to develop
              marketing strategies. In particular, that initiative applies to
              small companies that hitherto have not had the opportunity to
              develop their own marketing strategies because they have not had
              the necessary resources. As I mentioned in answer to a previous
              question, the Department is keen to expand the grossly
              under-exploited amount of business that is done through public
              tendering arrangements in which the public sector buy billions of
              pounds worth of goods and services on both sides of the border.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Therefore InterTradeIreland has a substantial
              agenda that it is working through well. I presented its corporate
              plan to the House following the most recent North/ South
              Ministerial Council meeting, and I am sure that the Member has
              read it assiduously.</p>

              Corporation. Locations in America, Europe and Asia were considered
              for this £27 million investment to service the European market.
              Omagh succeeded because of the availability of staff, suitable
              premises, the educational infrastructure, proximity to the market
              and support from Invest Northern Ireland and Omagh District

              the company to expand its operations to Omagh, thereby creating
              150 jobs. As the Minister will be aware, the move is raising
              morale in the area. The combined efforts are acknowledged. Omagh
              is the county town of Tyrone and has been identified as a major
              regional growth centre. The Minister referred to suitable
              accommodation. Does he wish to comment further on the value and
              importance of having an advance factory in helping to attract and
              secure inward investment?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Reg Empey:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was pleased to be present when the
              announcement of the investment in Omagh was made. I hope that 150,
              rather than 120, jobs will be created. I know that the
              announcement was well received in the local community because
              significant time had passed since such an investment had been
              announced for the Omagh District Council area. The presence of
              that facility outside the town was very significant. I visited the
              facility last year, and I was very impressed by its quality. The
              fact that it was already there and available to be altered for the
              needs of this company was one of the critical factors in the
              decision to locate in Omagh.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A similar situation arose at the end of 2000 in
              Strabane. An investment was located in Orchard Road by Fab Plus,
              which took over an advance factory. On a visit to Omagh shortly
              afterwards, I promised that we would take immediate action to
              ensure that further space was made available on an adjacent site
              in the area. A development brief has been produced, and I hope
              that a new facility, suitable for multiple occupancy or for an
              information and communication technology (ICT) company, will be
              available by this autumn. I am considering the situation in Omagh
              to establish whether a similar development should be made there. I
              will contact my colleagues in Invest Northern Ireland to see what
              response they intend to make.</p>

              also acknowledge the Minister’s reference to a similar project
              in Strabane. However, the Minister will realise that inward

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Member’s point about the cross-cutting
              nature of investment is valid. I agree that investment is not
              attracted by one factor. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and
              Investment liaises particularly closely with the Department for
              Employment and Learning. The availability of labour was one of the
              key considerations in this investment. Equally, matters such as
              transport are vital. That is a major issue in the Member’s
              constituency, and with such long distances to be travelled, the
              lack of transport is seen as a disadvantage.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have also answered questions from the hon
              Member and his other colleagues from west Tyrone on the
              availability of broadband, another piece of infrastructure that is
              important and goes a long way to counteract peripherality, which
              is at the root of the Member’s comments.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to liaising with Colleagues,
              transport strategies and such programmes are relevant. Indeed, if
              the Programme for Government is to have meaning, we must ensure
              that such matters are co-ordinated. I accept the Member’s point,
              but there is cross-cutting, cross-departmental liaison and ongoing
              work — particularly in areas of targeting social need or those
              with a history of significant unemployment — to ensure that
              measures are put in place to give poorer areas a reasonable
              opportunity to benefit in any economic upturn.</p>

              ensure that Invest Northern Ireland will have a significant
              regional presence. There are five local offices in Ballymena,
              Belfast, Londonderry, Omagh, and Newry, which will remain at
              present. However, there has been much interest and lobbying by
              many politicians on the matter, and the board of Invest Northern

              their staffing levels as a key priority.</p>

              support more people to start up businesses and to help those
              already in business. This issue is high on the board’s initial

              priority, and that will continue to be the case. Indeed, Invest
              Northern Ireland has been structured so that it has a managing
              director with external trade and investment as his key brief. Of
              course, the largest single slice of the investment cake comes from
              indigenous companies, and I do not envisage that that formula will
              change in the short term, particularly as the pool of mobile
              investment is considerably limited following 11 September 2001 and
              the events that flowed from that, which we have not seen the last
              of yet.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I believe that it will remain a top priority,
              because it is impossible to have a balanced and progressive
              economy unless there is a mixture of inward and indigenous
              investment. I assure the Member that we will not let up in our

              will have 26 weeks unpaid leave. The Bill will provide for two

              is an important issue, and it will be a cornerstone for my
              Department. Approximately 250,000 adults in Northern Ireland have,
              at best, the reading age of an average 11-year-old and, at worse,
              they cannot read the instructions on medicine bottles, they cannot
              read bus timetables, and they cannot help their children with
              their homework. Additional funding is required, and I hope that I

              that university shows that a very small proportion of the students
              are from the Protestant community. There is a chill factor in
              universities for Protestant students, and I want to know what the

              the relevant sites were released so that funds could be generated
              to build additional properties for those in need. Will he ensure

              asked if it would not be better for the land to be released. That

              meet housing demand in the Carrickfergus area. As the Member will
              know, and as the House should know, some estates in Carrickfergus
              are extremely popular, while others contain large numbers of

              that so many people are waiting for public-sector housing in the

              in which the Housing Executive is reducing the amount of public
              housing available in some areas? It is selling land, and there is

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not agree that those figures are
              particularly shocking, because the current ratio of applicants in
              housing stress to relets is 1:1·25, which shows that the housing
              needs of the whole area are largely being met. However, in order
              to deal with existing and anticipated pressures, housing
              associations, which provide all-new social housing, have planned a

              area. The last phase of 96 new houses in Poleglass and 15 new
              houses in Lisburn has just been completed. A further nine homes
              are under construction in Old Warren in Lisburn, and they will be
              completed in the autumn. In addition, over the next three-year
              planning cycle, housing associations plan to start building a
              further 218 new homes. In 2002-03 they plan to start three schemes
              of 180 new homes. In 2003-04 they plan to start four schemes of 40
              new homes. In 2004-05 they plan to start seven schemes of 98 new

              to allow the Northern Ireland Housing Executive to introduce a
              mandatory registration scheme for houses of multiple occupation.
              First, such a scheme will increase the protection given to tenants
              in such establishments by ensuring that the accommodation provided
              is safe and of good quality. Secondly, it will include measures to
              ensure that the owners and operators of houses of multiple
              occupation conduct themselves in a way that does not interfere
              with the rights of neighbouring residents to enjoy peaceful
              occupation of their homes.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Can the Minister clarify the nature of the
              legislation? For example, if someone has a tenancy agreement with
              the Housing Executive, a neighbour or local resident can approach
              the Housing Executive with allegations about a breach of that
              agreement. Does the legislation allow a neighbour of a person
              living in a house of registered multiple occupation to deal with a
              complaint in a similar way?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Dodds:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The scheme for houses of multiple occupation is
              designed to regulate those houses for the benefit of tenants and
              neighbours. If the Housing Executive moves towards a mandatory
              scheme, it will include measures to ensure that owners and
              operators of houses of multiple occupation conduct themselves in a
              way that does not interfere with the rights of neighbouring
              residents. I am aware of the need to introduce measures that will
              allow residents and neighbours to deal effectively with antisocial
              behaviour. The scheme that is being introduced to address
              antisocial behaviour, which is contained in the legislation, will
              deal effectively with the problem and is welcomed widely.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are many defects and problems in the
              current system. The general body of the legislation will include
              remedies and measures that currently cannot be used to deal with
              antisocial behaviour, which is why I am keen to see that
              legislation on the statute book as soon as possible. The provision
              of a mandatory licensing scheme will also go some way towards
              improving the situation for those who live in houses of multiple
              occupation.</p>

              glazing was installed, many houses of multiple occupation became
              fire traps. Indeed, he will be aware that several people,
              including students, have lost their lives. Is he satisfied that
              the legislation is adequate to prevent further tragedies?</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It will go a long way to improve the situation
              that the Member mentioned. Up to 30,000 people live in houses of
              multiple occupation throughout Northern Ireland. We must accept
              that that includes both high-quality and very poor, often
              overcrowded, accommodation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Student accommodation is not covered by current
              legislation. It will be covered under the proposed legislation,
              which will make a big improvement. Many landlords provide
              acceptable accommodation, but standards fall short in some areas.
              Once the legislation is through, those standards will be better
              addressed.</p>

              </font></b><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank those who made this inquiry and the
              report possible, especially the Committee staff, the witnesses and
              our special advisers. Speaking in broad support of the report and
              the motion as amended, I want to highlight some of the
              recommendations.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recommendation 3 refers to the attendance of
              Northern Ireland Executive Ministers at relevant European council
              meetings. I support that as an attempt to try to get Northern
              Ireland and our concerns closer to the heart of European
              decision-making. However, I want to go further than the
              recommendation as it stands. Indeed, I made this suggestion in the
              Committee. The regions of some other European Union member states
              represent their entire country on a rotational basis. Germany is a
              notable example, with the heads of provincial Governments
              representing the rest of the Länder. Northern Ireland ministerial
              representatives could represent the whole of the United Kingdom,
              and on other occasions, representatives from the Scottish
              Parliament and the National Assembly for Wales and their
              Administrations could do likewise.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support recommendation 4 with respect to the
              maintenance of an up-to-date database on forthcoming European
              Directives, and provision of that information with adequate notice
              to the relevant departmental Committees. I link that to
              recommendation 6, which refers to the provision of up-to-date
              reports on the implementation of European Union Directives and, in
              particular, on so-called infraction proceedings that might arise
              from the insufficiently speedy implementation of such Directives,
              which could lead to fines. Many Members mentioned those. Indeed,
              in that case a stitch in time could indeed, financially speaking,
              save nine.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also support recommendation 7. The Executive’s
              framework proposals on the relationship with the European Union
              contained 100 high- and medium-level priorities. That is simply
              far too many, because if everything is made a priority, nothing
              will be a priority, and the list as it stands is unfortunately
              close to meaningless.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I had more problems with recommendation 10,
              which proposes the creation of a dedicated committee for European
              affairs. I understand its logic and, as other Members have pointed
              out, several external witnesses said that it was a good idea.
              However, I want to put it on record that there are practical
              problems with implementing recommendation 10, and the report notes
              that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first is that, as many of us know, we
              already face problems in maintaining adequately the existing
              number of Committees by retaining a quorum.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second problem is the potential for turf
              wars between Committees. For example, the Committees for
              Agriculture and Rural Development and the Environment have a heavy
              diet of EU-related matters. How would they take to offloading
              those responsibilities or rights to a dedicated Committee? Perhaps
              they would be happy, but perhaps they would not be, and that must
              be considered.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The third problem is the worrying precedent
              that arose when the Committee of the Centre took evidence. We
              heard that the Scottish Parliament has created a dedicated
              European Affairs committee. Similarly, for some years, the House
              of Commons has had such a Committee. If we create a Committee for
              Europe we must look very carefully at the relationship — in
              fact, the co-ordination — between that Committee and its
              counterpart in the House of Commons. There is evidence from our
              visits to London and Edinburgh that the relationship between the
              London-based Committee and that in Edinburgh is severely
              dysfunctional, in spite of, or perhaps because of, the fact that
              in both cases the majority of members are from the Labour Party.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I strongly support recommendation 26 that one
              of the junior Ministers should take a lead on European-related
              affairs. By implication, that would lead to the other junior
              Minister leading on matters concerning OFMDFM. That is perhaps a
              necessary piece of good administrative housekeeping which should
              have been introduced some time ago.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In closing my remarks, I will make some general
              comments. We should be optimistic, but realistic, about what we
              could, and should, aim for the Northern Ireland Administration to
              achieve in the European Union. As was noted by other Members, we
              are a small player in that regard. Our region’s population is
              1·7 million — barely 0·5 per cent of that of the entire
              European Union. That percentage will obviously go down further if,
              as I hope, enlargement into the East occurs. In the recent past we
              may have punched above our weight in the influence stakes for
              several reasons. One was sympathy for us, given the troubles since
              1969. Another seems to be a feeling in the Commission that it
              contributed powerfully to the so-called peace process after 1995.
              Neither of those factors is likely to endure, although we should
              make the most of them while they exist.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the 1990s the economic transfer from the
              European Union to Northern Ireland with respect to the common
              agricultural policy, the likely effects on foreign direct
              investment, the impact of more free trade and, very notably, the
              structural funds, though on the debit side higher food prices paid
              by consumers, may in total have amounted to 5% net of our regional
              gross domestic product. That is a significant economic benefit,
              but it is dwarfed by the net transfer from the United Kingdom
              Treasury system. Therefore, in that respect, it is important to
              put EU matters in perspective.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No matter how far upstream we manage to get in
              the policy-making process in the Commission in Brussels, there are
              doubts about how much we can change some of the so-called common
              policies, such as the common agricultural policy and the common
              fisheries policy, in our favour. In the case of the common
              agricultural policy, the possibility that, in the coming years, it
              will gradually collapse under its own contradictions may work in
              our favour. The agricultural policy may return to being operated,
              funded and administered at separate national levels. It will be
              repatriated to the national Governments in the European Union.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the Executive can get their overall social
              and economic policy right through measures such as the Programme
              for Government, to a degree the correct strategy for European
              matters will be implied. Subject to the implementation of all the
              qualifying factors, I support the motion as amended.</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the Deputy Chairperson of the Committee for
              the Environment, I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the
              debate. The Committee was pleased to note that the draft EU
              Framework document goes some way to address several of the
              recommendations made in its response to the Committee of the
              Centre’s European inquiry. For example, the development of
              appropriate training and secondment opportunities which several
              Members mentioned, and the commitment to improving essential
              networking skills should assist Northern Ireland to participate
              more fully in the early stages of policy formulation and to pursue
              its own interests in Europe more effectively.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee noted that in addition to the
              specific environmental policy, four of the seven European policy
              areas identified in the draft EU Framework document have important
              environmental content. These included the EU structural funds,
              agriculture, fisheries and education and training and employment,
              which came under the heading of education for sustainable
              development and training and building skills for the green
              economy.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee is concerned that the environment
              should not be compartmentalised, rather it should be viewed by the
              Executive, the Government Departments and the wider community as a
              core cross-cutting issue. In that light, the Office of the First
              Minister and the Deputy First Minister may wish to emphasise the
              opportunity presented by the EU structural funds as an important
              vehicle to bring Northern Ireland in line with the levels of
              environmental awareness and good practice in other parts of the EU
              by ensuring that the funding programmes are rigorously proofed for
              their environmental impact.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The introduction to the draft EU Framework
              document refers to facilitating an improved understanding of the
              EU among the Northern Ireland Departments and the wider community,
              and paragraph 4 goes some way to recognise that concern. Many
              non-governmental organisations (NGOs) that work in Northern
              Ireland, including the World Wide Fund for Nature, Friends of the
              Earth and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, have
              considerable understanding of the workings of the EU and are
              involved in Europe-wide networks that have wide experience of
              lobbying on environment issues. The Committee agrees with some of
              the recommendations that the Department may wish to utilise the
              experience and contacts provided by such organisations in
              developing strategies to engage with EU institutions.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important that the Office of the First
              Minister and the Deputy First Minister has the necessary
              co-ordinating role in EU policy. The Committee is concerned that
              the experience of direct rule may have had a negative impact on
              the skill levels in Departments, and it believes that all
              Departments, including the Department of the Environment, must
              address the growing need for radical change in organisational
              culture to meet the demands of the devolved Administration.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Therefore the Committee recommends that the
              Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister adopt a
              more proactive leadership role to take the necessary steps to
              facilitate the training and secondment opportunities that have
              been mentioned, to assist Departments’ identification of
              priorities and to balance the need for policy innovation against
              the more familiar processes of dealing with the backlog of EU
              Directives that have not yet been transposed.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In its response to the Committee of the Centre’s
              European inquiry, the Environment Committee expressed a concern
              that there is a considerable risk that the Department of the
              Environment’s outlook on the European Union may be dominated for
              some time to come by the risk of infraction proceedings. The
              Committee reiterates that the Department of the Environment should
              not simply view itself as a delivery mechanism for EU decisions
              and legislation but should develop its understanding of EU
              institutions and improve communication with EU officials in order
              to gain a sense of ownership of European environmental
              policy-making.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Under objective 5 of the draft EU Framework
              document, the Executive identified several steps to address the
              need to raise Northern Ireland’s positive profile in Europe,
              including arranging visits to EU member states and institutions by
              Ministers and other delegations. We have already heard from the
              Chairperson of the Committee about the number of Ministers who
              have not yet engaged in or communicated actively with Europe. That
              ties in with the Committee’s recommendation that the Minister of
              the Environment should take the lead in developing a positive
              relationship between the Department and the EU institutions.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I would now like to speak on the matter in more
              general terms, and as a member of the Committee of the Centre.
              Communication is vital to promote awareness of, and to encourage
              debate on, EU issues that directly affect Northern Ireland. The
              establishment of a web site as a central resource would be
              valuable, and an excellent way to share information with
              non-governmental organisations and local government. The inclusion
              of evidence- gathering and widespread consultation would provide a
              basis for benchmarking and best practice in relation to the other
              UK regions. We must also facilitate the development of links with
              other devolved institutions to promote our involvement at an early
              stage in matters that affect Northern Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The exchange of information among the agencies
              involved in European matters, and the utilisation of expertise in
              that area, is vital to increase our knowledge of, and familiarity
              with, EU policies and legislation, as well as their impact on
              Northern Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I too express my thanks to the staff involved
              in producing the report, and I commend the report to the Assembly.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Deputy Chairperson of the Committee of the
              Centre (Mr Gibson):</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have great pleasure in supporting the
              recommendation from the Committee Chairperson earlier today. The
              43 recommendations are a serious attempt to represent the various
              interests that take the view that Northern Ireland, as a region,
              should be well represented in Europe. As several Members have
              said, those people are fully aware that 80% of the policies that
              affect us directly in Northern Ireland emanate from Europe.
              Furthermore, 60% of our legislation is influenced directly by
              Europe. Therefore, it would be foolish for any Executive or region
              to ignore a power that has such a great impact on our day-to-day
              lives.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The distilled wisdom that is to be found in the
              43 recommendations was gathered from the sincere presentations
              that were made to the Committee. The Committee heard from some
              people who had a great deal of experience in Europe. I am thinking
              about people such as the UK Permanent Representative to the EU,
              Sir Nigel Sheinwald, who gave us some very important pointers that
              are included in the recommendations. The Northern Ireland Centre
              in Europe has already made a massive contribution. It has 10 years
              of experience and was able to bring to us a working knowledge of
              how a region can be effective and efficient. Their contribution
              helped us to form our opinions. The forthright comments of our
              three MEPs cannot be ignored either. They are experienced in
              Europe — they have been effective there and have helped to
              deliver a massive amount of money, which has been useful in
              developing this Province. They have a vision of how the Executive,
              the Assembly, the non-governmental agencies and Northern Ireland
              plc can influence policy and decision-making. John Simpson, who
              has long European experience, also impressed me. He made several
              helpful concrete suggestions.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is a positive report. The infant body of
              the new Executive, which is trying to make its way in Europe, has
              been given good directions and sensible guidelines by the
              Committee. This has been developed from the experiences of those
              who have seen how it works and who have made a judgement on how
              our region can be effective. Members have already covered several
              of the recommendations and have made important points. However, it
              would be wrong for the Executive to ignore this report in its
              totality. In fact, they cannot ignore it, as the report combines
              the collected wisdom of those who are working in the best
              interests of Northern Ireland. I hope that the Assembly accepts
              and recommends the report. I hope that the Executive and the two
              junior Ministers will use this as a stairway to the future of
              Northern Ireland as an effective and efficient region of the
              European Union. I commend the report.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Beggs:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the Committee’s investigation into
              European issues, it became clear that European engagement from a
              Northern Ireland perspective was not being comprehensively
              addressed — far from it. That should not surprise us, because
              during direct rule Ministers were content to let Westminster
              Ministers take the lead on European issues, with the largely Great
              Britain perspective of Labour or Conservative Governments. Our
              investigations have shown that other devolved regions have
              recognised the importance of monitoring European affairs,
              particularly where issues have had a regional effect on them.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">(Mr Deputy Speaker [Mr J Wilson] in the Chair)</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the recommendations there are 100
              priorities, and that highlights the lack of focus. It also
              suggests that the unit is under-resourced, and I hope that the
              junior Minister is pleased that, for once, a cross-party group of
              Members is calling for additional resources and not criticising
              top-heavy bureaucracy in a Department. Additional resources are
              needed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The example of Scotland Europa compares
              favourably with the experiences of the office of the Northern
              Ireland Executive in Brussels. The titles suggest the differences
              between the approaches of the two devolved regions of Northern
              Ireland and Scotland. The office of the Northern Ireland Executive
              in Brussels is just that — an isolated office serving the
              Northern Ireland Executive. It must be widened to involve the
              entire European Community.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Scotland Europa and the Scottish EU Office are
              now housed under the same roof. Scotland Europa encompasses a wide
              network of Scottish regional organisations in Europe: the
              Convention of Scottish Local Authorities; local commerce and
              industry; universities and the world of academia. It is vital to
              develop a similar network to monitor issues that are significant
              to Northern Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, I add a note of caution: we will not
              be able to control what is going on in Europe, therefore people
              must be realistic about what they expect to come out of this.
              Northern Ireland is a small cog linked to a bigger cog — the UK’s
              representation in Europe — that contributes to EU policy.
              However, there will be several issues of particular importance to
              Northern Ireland that we might be able to lobby effectively with
              other devolved regions.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In common with other contributors to the
              debate, I note the similarity of regional interests that affect
              Northern Ireland, Scotland and, to a certain degree, Wales. These
              are rurality; the importance of agriculture and, to a degree, the
              importance of forestry and fishing, and our peripherality in
              Europe.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several Members commented on recommendations
              concerning networking. Clearly, the experience gained in that area
              to date has not been properly tapped. I fully support
              recommendations 9, 29, 32 and 33. I also endorse the
              recommendations referring to the Northern Ireland Centre in Europe
              highlighted by my East Antrim Colleague Sean Neeson and others.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I recall the helpful, friendly and constructive
              engagement that the Northern Ireland Centre in Europe had with
              Members during the first visit to Brussels prior to devolution,
              and I know that that has continued to a degree. However, financial
              support is needed so that it can bear the fruit that could
              develop.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I give my broad support to the thrust of the
              recommendations, and it is in that spirit that I support the
              amendment proposed by the Chairperson of the Committee to accept
              the report. However, I wish to highlight that further work must be
              done. For example, recommendation 10 proposes the establishment of
              a Standing Committee on EU affairs and that we must firm up the
              Committee’s workload, its membership and its quorum. I must
              express reservations — which I did to the Committee of the
              Centre — about the establishment of yet another Committee.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I serve on several Committees, and I am aware
              of the difficulties of maintaining a quorum on occasions. Indeed,
              an examination of the proceedings in the Committee’s report
              shows that there was a poor turnout frequently in what is a
              17-member Committee. My concerns about the introduction of yet
              another Committee must be addressed. Membership and quorums of all
              Committees might have to be reassessed if Members are unable to
              attend meetings. Perhaps some Members should also have to answer
              for the frequency of their non-attendance.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the recommendations in the spirit
              that more work must be done. I particularly look forward to
              hearing not only the comments from junior Ministers Denis Haughey
              and James Leslie but also to a detailed response from OFMDFM on
              how they intend to address each recommendation, or if there are
              other issues that we are not aware of: we must think about how
              best to address such issues.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am content to accept the broad thrust of the
              report. I acknowledge that it has brought a significant
              improvement to what has been happening to date. It has brought a
              new perspective, a new level of scrutiny, and I hope that the net
              result will be to the betterment of everyone in Northern Ireland.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Shannon:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I support the recommendations and wish to make
              some points. The main problem with the EU is that many of our
              constituents know that we are a part of Europe and that European
              legislation affects many parts of our lives. However, they know
              very little of how, when and where such effect takes place. The
              public has heard of the EU only through tabloid press stories
              about straight bananas; one flavour of crisps; an EU law, and,
              indeed, metrication, which we have all heard about lately.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.15 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is why the Committee’s first
              recommendation is important. It recommends that the work of the
              Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister should
              be open and transparent on European Union matters, including
              membership of the working group, its aims, agenda and its outcome.
              As the Ministers in question were voted into their offices
              somewhat democratically, we should insist that every part of the
              process of government is democratic and, therefore, open to
              scrutiny. Not only does the public want to know what is going on
              in this country and what affects it on a wider European scale; it
              is entitled to know. After all, any legislation that we in our
              offices believe is right and good for the country affects the
              people directly, but it may not be what the people want.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is recommended that the database of EU
              Directives be brought up to date, as there is much legislation
              coming into being every day, some of which can be used to help or
              to hinder Northern Ireland. The database must be current and
              readily accessible so that the devolved Assembly can be adequately
              prepared for the future and the ramifications of any new
              legislation or Programme for Government order. Further to the
              updating of the database of EU Directives, a central resource
              should be established that not only collates all the available
              European Union information, but also helps explain the context,
              the implications, the opportunities and the threats.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is to be concurrent with the establishment
              of web-based portals and should be investigated as a method of
              sharing information with the rest of Northern Ireland. It is only
              sensible that, as the point of entry for these laws, the Assembly
              should facilitate the availability of such information to the
              people of the Province. Those of us who are not fluent in the
              workings of the law and legal terminology can have specialist
              advice and translations that make the lengthy and sometimes
              laborious wording of these Directives less confusing and more
              user-friendly. It will also be of great benefit to the children of
              our Province who study politics. They could access this web site
              and use it to their advantage and to its main purpose. It would be
              invaluable to the smooth running of the Assembly, not to mention
              Northern Ireland as a whole.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The main suggestion that I support is that of
              European Union familiarisation for all Assembly Members, which
              does not just focus on their Committee responsibilities. We all
              move around the Assembly and take up new posts. Even today we have
              seen a change of Committee membership. An overview of the effects
              of the EU on each part of the Assembly should be available to
              everyone; in fact, it must be given to every entrant when taking a
              position in the Assembly.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If this is combined with the recommendation
              that the Assembly should provide secondments for Assembly staff to
              EU institutions that will also facilitate a better understanding
              of the European Union and its policies. The staff who are given
              the go-ahead for secondments could help in the development of the
              web site and in the collation of all available information.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are all agreed that the main problem is that
              while the European Union’s policies impact on 80% of Northern
              Ireland’s policies and 60% of the Programme for Government, our
              contact for European legislation is Whitehall, and some links have
              yet to be established between Whitehall and the Assembly. As the
              Assembly in its present form is new and innovative, we should
              perhaps exercise more caution. We must ensure that the legislation
              that is being handed down is not detrimental to the democracy and
              the policies of the parties involved in Northern Ireland. The
              safeguard of Whitehall is not fully implemented, and thus we must
              insist in the strongest terms that the explanatory memorandum from
              the United Kingdom’s Cabinet Office is shared with the Assembly
              and its Committees.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We may be living on the periphery of Europe,
              but we must ensure that Europe is central in our thoughts so that
              we can stop any detrimental legislation forcing restrictions on
              the people of Northern Ireland. One has only to look at the fiasco
              in the fishing industry; it has been almost crippled by the
              restrictions and the quotas placed on it. If we had known as soon
              as possible what was happening in Europe, we could have done our
              best to ensure that Northern Ireland’s voice was heard and taken
              account of. Representing the constituency of Strangford, I know,
              perhaps better than most, how much events in Europe have impacted
              on the fishing industry in a village that is almost dependent on
              fishing for its future.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must also address the lack of detail in the
              Framework document on resources and methodology.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is obvious that the funding for many of our
              programmes will be stopped in 2006, and we need to know what other
              options will be made available. With a lack of clarity in the
              Framework document, the recommendations will be important. We need
              to know what is stated in the light of legislation, and we need to
              know immediately that such information is published. Therefore, we
              need to have people who are in touch with the European Union, and
              we need to have the policies interpreted and made accessible for
              all Members of the Assembly. Members also need to be educated in
              the way the European Union works, so that they can access funding
              for their respective Committees.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The recommendations of the report must be
              accepted. They are a very focused way forward and would benefit
              everyone in Northern Ireland. They would take the unknown element
              out of the European Union for many people — and also for some
              politicians. The European Union and Northern Ireland have a great
              deal of history, but for many that history is shrouded in legal
              red tape and lengthy technicalities that need explanation. We need
              to agree to the recommendations so that we can remove the
              bureaucracy and put Northern Ireland firmly on the map of Europe,
              and not on the edge, where it seems to be now and has been for
              many years.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Savage:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I commend the Committee of the Centre on its
              excellent report. Its 40-odd recommendations are all useful and
              will advance how Northern Ireland interacts with the EU in a more
              structured, organised and effective way. As a member of the EU
              Committee of the Regions, I understand fully the critical role
              that Europe plays in what we do here and how we can achieve our
              maximum.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Eighty per cent of the Programme for Government
              is derived directly from EU initiatives, and that shows where the
              power lies. The whole concept of networking set out in the report
              is critical to the success of Northern Ireland in Europe. I refer
              not just to government networks but also non-governmental networks
              and informal networks. There is a great deal of EU expertise and
              experience in our community, and we must tap into it, recognise it
              and use it to our advantage. Networking is the key to success in
              Europe, and it needs to be focused. We must have a Europe Minister
              and a European affairs Committee. As a high proportion of our laws
              are made in Europe and a high proportion of our funding comes via
              Europe, it merits such treatment.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let me illustrate this from the Committee for
              Agriculture and Rural Development’s point of view. Each year,
              Northern Irish farmers are paid about £160 million in subsidies
              by the European Union, and UK sources pay only £16 million. That
              is why we need to be more EU-focused. Europe is increasingly
              regional. Regional parliaments like ours play a major role in all
              countries — in federal Germany and what is now a federal France
              — so we must espouse Europe. It is part of our identity, and we
              must directly and energetically interface with it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must throw off the shackles of direct rule,
              during which we were at the wrong end of the UK queue with a
              begging bowl in hand. We must become active and aggressive
              Europeans. This Assembly has only been in existence for a few
              years, and we are still in a learning process. However, as time
              goes on, we will learn and be able to hold our own anywhere in the
              world.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have talked about what has happened in
              different places, and a Colleague referred to subsidies for fish.
              According to the Commission’s latest assessment, national
              subsidies fell by over 30% between 1997 and 1999. The second
              scoreboard reveals a steady decline in EU state aid for sectors
              such as industry, services, agriculture, fisheries and railways.
              However, the survey still finds significant disparities between
              member states in the distribution of state subsidies. For
              instance, state aid to manufacturing and to the coal and service
              industries, as a percentage of overall aid, ranged from 16% in
              Luxembourg to 69% in Portugal. Aid to fisheries accounted for only
              7% of overall aid in Germany, but was as high as 73% in Finland
              and some other countries. In the UK, which had the lowest total
              amount of state aid at less than 0·05% of gross domestic product,
              most went to manufacturing and the railways.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We need a strong representation in Europe,
              because that is where the real power base resides. It is of
              paramount importance that we get the fair share of money to which
              we are entitled. As time goes on I fear that unless we pay more
              attention to what goes on in Europe we will be worse off. We need
              full-time people there. I know that the MEPs spend much of their
              time in Europe. That is where the power lies, and it is where we
              must make a big impact.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some Members spoke earlier about their
              involvement in the Committee of the Regions. Unless we have people
              there from Northern Ireland to speak their mind when policies are
              being made that affect the UK, we will get nothing. I have seen
              that over the past three weeks. We need representation to fight
              for our entitlements. I support the proposals and recommendations
              made by the Committee of the Centre.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Junior Minister (Office of the First
              Minister and the Deputy First Minister) (Mr Leslie):</b> I have
              several observations to make on the report, after which my
              Colleague Mr Denis Haughey will sum up in detail on behalf of the
              Executive. I apologise for being late for the restart. I had
              thought that we would start again at 4.00 pm, and was caught on
              the hop by the small number of questions to the Minister for
              Social Development.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the debate and the report from the
              Committee. It is important that we reflect on European issues and
              on the relationship that Northern Ireland should be seeking to
              build with the EU and its constituent parts. I acknowledge the
              detailed work that the Committee has done to produce the report,
              which is full of constructive and thoughtful suggestions.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive are committed to developing an
              effective EU approach, which is crucial. The remarks that Mr
              Savage has just made from a regional perspective are exceedingly
              pertinent. We also need to be aware that timing is very important,
              as the European Convention is engaging in a wide-ranging debate
              about the future of the EU and its structures. That work is about
              to commence, and it is important that Northern Ireland formulates
              views that will form part of that debate. Northern Ireland, with
              only 1·7 million people, is a very small part of the EU. We are
              not going to have much influence on our own, so it is important
              that we find common cause with other regions.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To get that process started, we intend to host
              a conference in the summer that will focus on the debate on the
              future of Europe. That conference will draw together interest
              groups from across sectors of society, and will provide a natural
              forum in which to address the major strategic EU policy issues. We
              envisage that the conference will be, in effect, a first annual
              forum.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.30 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Committee specifically mentioned a forum,
              and I hope that it will react favourably to the proposal by OFMDFM.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The inquiry contains 43 conclusions, and these
              set a direction for policy. In view of the number of
              recommendations made and the detail in which the Committee has
              formulated them, it would be unrealistic for us to respond in
              detail at such short notice. However, all the matters raised are
              worthy of detailed consideration, and that is what we will give
              them. We will respond in detail, item by item, to the Committee as
              soon as we can. Some of the proposals that the Committee made are
              already part of our plans, and progress on these will soon be
              seen. Other proposals are new suggestions to which OFMDFM will
              have to give careful consideration.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are also some proposals that cut across
              the work of more than one Department. Although overarching
              responsibility lies with OFMDFM, individual Ministers will
              inevitably have specific views on matters significant to their
              Departments. In that respect, the proposal for a Committee on EU
              matters, which is a matter for the Assembly to decide for itself,
              requires quite a lot of thought. For example, who will take the
              lead on issues relating to the common agricultural policy?
              Hitherto, the Committee for Agriculture and Rural Development has
              done so because it reflects directly on that Department. Is it
              suggested that the EU Committee should do that? There are
              important issues that need to be carefully thought through.
              Nonetheless, the Committee makes the point that many of these
              issues are cross-cutting, and that is crucial.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report makes recommendations on
              cross-cutting themes and using the range of available expertise
              and networks including those outside the Government. It urges us
              to involve, in a more systematic way, key players such as MEPs and
              representatives on EU institutions. We know that we must consult
              with these people and bodies. Some work has been done, and more is
              continuing.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are also looking with interest at how
              measure 4·1 of the Peace II programme, which is worth about £6
              million up to the end of 2006 and which seeks to promote Northern
              Ireland and the border counties as an outward and foreign looking
              region, can best be used. By the end of this month we should have
              responses to the call for projects, and through these we hope to
              develop our approach and see how groups can be supported in this
              work. It is an area on which OFMDFM has more to learn, but we want
              to get started with some projects and look for further tranches as
              our experience develops. We are giving thought to ways in which
              communication with MEPs and the Committee of the Regions can be
              developed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We note the Scottish model. That the Committee
              took a close look at that and at the arrangements in Wales was
              valuable. However, the Scottish Parliament’s European Committee
              has regular meetings with MEPs and other representatives, and we
              will be looking carefully at that, but it is a two-way process. If
              such meetings were to be held in Brussels, all our MEPs would have
              to be in Brussels. Although Mr Nicholson is exemplary in that
              regard, the same cannot be said of the others.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Executive put forward a draft strategic
              framework to the Committee in February. In that we reflected on
              the links with UK Government and, as has been highlighted today,
              while national policy is not devolved, there are elements in it
              that have a devolved effect. The links with Departments in
              Whitehall will inevitably be crucial. We have to be realistic
              about this. The Prime Minister came into office making a great
              fuss about how he was going to put the United Kingdom at the heart
              of Europe. It is not particularly noticeable that he has succeeded
              in that. Therefore, we have to be realistic in our expectations of
              the position that Northern Ireland might be able to achieve.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report is sensible in recommending that a
              small number of strategic priorities should be identified. That
              relates to my previous point; it is sensible and realistic, as to
              try to pursue too many at once would inevitably lead to
              disappointment. The framework strategy identified all the areas of
              current work. It was not intended to be a list of priorities; it
              was a list of the work. The Committee is right to say that
              specific priorities need to be identified, and we will be working
              on that and liaising with the Committee.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report also reflects on how work is
              organised in the Office of the First Minister and the Deputy First
              Minister and on the staffing issues. These are being addressed,
              and we are undertaking a considerable increase in staff numbers.
              We hope that the European Policy Co-ordination Unit will be
              doubled in size in two or three months.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We have looked at the methods being used by the
              Scottish Executive in their Brussels office, and there are useful
              lessons for us. I hope that Members will be aware that extra space
              was deliberately taken in our offices in Brussels with a view to
              expansion being available and to being able to have different
              entities develop there. My Colleague, Mr Haughey, will say more
              about that in a few moments.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the report and the interest of the
              Committee. We will be taking its recommendations seriously and
              responding to them in detail. Mr Gibson seemed to think that we
              were going to ignore the report. I assure him that we will not,
              although he said that we might not be able to accept it in its
              totality, and I dare say that that may prove to be the case.
              However, the Committee will see, in early course, a number of
              measures coming forward that will closely mirror the suggestions
              made in its report.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Deputy Speaker:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will call Mr Haughey to make a response. In
              the earlier contribution there was an element of response as well
              as a personal contribution, but I was in a tolerant mood.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Junior Minister (Office of the First
              Minister and the Deputy First Minister) (Mr Haughey):</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I wonder why. I greatly appreciate your
              tolerance, Mr Deputy Speaker.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the members of the Committee of the
              Centre for their detailed and valuable work in producing the
              report. I know that the inquiry has been detailed and robust, and
              I welcome that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I listened with interest to the remarks about
              the change in the wording of the motion. We were a wee bit
              surprised that we were not given some notice of that. However,
              overall we welcome the report of the Committee, and on first
              reading I have found, as I think we all have, much in it on which
              we are likely to agree. It is heartening that on an issue such as
              this where, in the past, there has been some difference of view
              and emphasis, we have found so much common ground and agreement
              across the divide between the parties in the Committee of the
              Centre, and in the Assembly, on how we should approach being part
              of the European Union.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A report of this kind, weight and depth will
              require careful reflection. We will respond in full as an
              Administration on each of the recommendations as quickly as we
              can. I cannot say today that we accept the report totally or that
              we will implement in detail every one of its recommendations, as
              there are many matters to be considered. However, we will commit
              ourselves to carefully considering the report and the
              recommendations, although we cannot be bound by it in every
              detail.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today’s debate demonstrates the Assembly’s
              interest in, and concern with, European affairs. We are determined
              to broaden the debate in the community in the coming months. Our
              detailed response to the Committee’s report will be one input
              into that debate. The Administration’s work in planning,
              addressing and reviewing our relationships in the European Union
              is an important element of the Assembly’s role.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Before I respond to the details of the
              Committee’s report, I will make a few comments. First, the
              report is wide-ranging and includes 43 recommendations. Many of
              those have important implications and must be studied carefully by
              the Executive. Those recommendations also have implications —
              not the least of which are the cost implications — for various
              Departments, not only for the Office of the First Minister and the
              Deputy First Minister. The Administration would not want to be
              bound to implement all 43 recommendations — or those that apply
              to the Administration — and incur the substantial costs
              involved, only to have those who made the recommendations jump on
              them for spending all that money. The Executive will look
              carefully at all the implications of the recommendations.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Assembly will have to consider the
              recommendations as they apply to it. Six of them —
              recommendation 10 and others — have direct implications for the
              Assembly. Would an Assembly Committee on European affairs lead on
              the matter of CAP reform, or would the Committee for Agriculture
              and Regional Development play the lead role? Would the Committee
              for Enterprise, Trade and Investment lead on competition policy?
              These important issues need to be thought through carefully, as
              they would have an impact on the work of the Committees and of the
              Assembly. Given that we have had a relatively short time to read
              the report and look at the recommendations, we need to give the
              matter careful consideration over time, rather than to rush into
              accepting the recommendations in total today.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is timely to remember that membership of the
              European Union has brought Northern Ireland and its citizens a
              considerable range of benefits and opportunities. I am aware that
              some Members are not fully persuaded of the value of the European
              Union. That is their absolute right. For my part, I am convinced
              that there are many gains for all citizens of the European Union,
              not least the citizens of Northern Ireland, through the widening
              and deepening of contacts across the continent. Some commentators
              seek to obscure those gains and introduce irrelevancies about
              European superstates, about the loss of identity, and as Mr
              Shannon pointed out, make ridiculous points about the
              straightening of bananas and about the planting and growth of
              square tomatoes. They also seek either to deceive the public about
              the implications of European union or to rubbish it by introducing
              all kinds of nonsense about it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The increasing co-operation and development
              across Europe has produced significant and measurable advantages
              for the citizens of Europe, and it has seen a prolonged period of
              peace, which is no small or unimportant matter. It has seen the
              growth of greater economic prosperity and support for those
              citizens in society most in need. It has also seen a growth in
              equality Directives and the outlawing of discrimination. Much
              greater progress has been made in those areas in a European
              context than was ever made in the national context. These are all
              positive outcomes of our membership of the European Union. It is
              my conviction that these outcomes have been achieved through the
              establishment of an ever-closer union between the people of the
              member states.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Despite the range of views in the Assembly and
              in the community about European integration, a positive feature of
              our approach has been cross-community co-operation on European
              issues.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">4.45 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Northern Ireland’s three MEPs have
              established a strong record of collective and constructive work,
              which has greatly advantaged our community. Since devolution, the
              Executive have sought to continue a collective and positive
              approach. I am pleased to report that there are continuing
              positive outcomes in our relationships with the European
              institutions.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I acknowledge that some Members have not
              reached the same conclusions as the Administration on European
              integration. Therefore it is all the more significant that a
              Committee that contains a diversity of views on those matters has
              produced such a helpful and constructive report.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some quarters have been quick to criticise the
              work of the devolved institutions. The detailed, constructive,
              positive approach of the Committee of the Centre and the work that
              it has produced are a clear illustration of our collective
              commitment to work on behalf of the electorate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On behalf of my Colleagues in the Office of the
              First Minister and the Deputy First Minister, I fully welcome the
              report and assure the House that the closest possible
              consideration will be given to the analysis and recommendations in
              it. The report contains a useful analysis of our situation. It
              carefully examines the value of our approach, and it makes
              considered recommendations to protect our interests, to project
              the distinctive voice of Northern Ireland and to avail of the
              opportunities that our membership of the European Union gives us.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have considered the report carefully, and
              three major themes emerge from it. First, we should develop and
              implement a collective and workable vision of Northern Ireland as
              a region of the European Union. Secondly, we should draw on the
              learning derived from our work in the European Union, that which
              we can derive from our colleagues in other parts of the European
              Union and from our own citizens’ work in the European Union.
              Thirdly, we should establish effective, open and transparent
              working methods that make the best use of the public resources
              invested in that area.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I should like to speak about the development
              and implementation of a collective vision. I note that the
              Committee reviewed in considerable detail the approaches in other
              parts of the United Kingdom, in the Republic of Ireland and in
              regions of other member states. As I read the Committee’s
              evidence, I was struck by how the successful regions in Europe
              identified clearly the regional role in the European Union of
              member states. It reflects my experience of working in European
              matters for over 20 years. Successful regions have considered the
              reality of the regional role, examined the potential of that role
              and defined a clear and practical vision that meets the strengths
              and addresses the weaknesses of their region. The less successful
              regions have done that less well. The less well they have done it,
              the less successful they have been.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Northern Ireland has made considerable progress
              in developing that approach in some areas. Our political
              representatives in the European Parliament, the Committee of the
              Regions and in the Economic and Social Committee have a strong
              track record of working together cohesively, identifying available
              opportunities and co-operating to secure progress on them. Through
              that work we have received considerable financial benefit from our
              colleagues in the other member states through the mainstream
              structural funds programmes and, significantly, through the
              special support that has been given to Northern Ireland through
              the programme for peace and reconciliation, Peace II and the major
              contributions made by the European Union to the International Fund
              for Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All Members have seen the substantial benefits
              of that support in their constituencies, and they welcome the
              assistance that has been provided. However, the challenge now is
              to build on the progress that has been made with the assistance of
              the European Union. Devolution has brought new and important roles
              for Ministers, Committees and Members.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the report, the Committee identifies the
              necessity to work towards establishing better ways of integrating
              the work of Ministers, Committees and Members, as well as agencies
              and bodies outside the Assembly, in a collective regional
              approach. There is considerable value in such integration.
              Officials in the Department will undertake further work to address
              the issues that the report has highlighted and to secure the kind
              of open working methods that are required. As the report
              illustrates, it is also essential to ensure that the work of all
              sectors has access to the development and implementation of the
              collective vision that the Assembly hopes to demonstrate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I made clear in my evidence to the Committee
              of the Centre and in discussions with the Chairperson and Deputy
              Chairperson and members of the Committee, the Office of the First
              Minister and the Deputy First Minister is strongly committed to a
              collective approach. Many issues that the Assembly faces in
              relation to the European Union and European matters highlight
              clearly the need to work collectively — to establish frameworks
              and approaches that enable all sectors to share their perspectives
              in order to reach a better understanding of how issues affect each
              other. A common misconception is that regional Administrations
              such as that of Northern Ireland must be organised in Brussels in
              order to do business in Europe. It is more important to be
              organised in Northern Ireland in order to develop the capacity
              here to do business in the European Union.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the Assembly works together to develop the
              approaches of the new institutions, the Office of the First
              Minister and the Deputy First Minister will seek to put in place
              improved mechanisms for providing better information and enabling
              other sectors to play their part and to deliver on their
              responsibilities in this collective work. At the opening of the
              Office of the Northern Ireland Executive in Brussels, the First
              Minister and the Deputy First Minister made it clear that the
              Administration see that office as a resource for all sectors and
              interests in Northern Ireland. The report notes that the name of
              the office is perhaps, therefore, somewhat misleading. That point
              will be considered by the Office of the First Minister and the
              Deputy First Minister.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When I spoke at the function in Brussels, which
              was held on the day of the opening of the office, I made it clear
              that it was simply a building block in the construction of a much
              bigger edifice — the regional representation in Brussels of all
              sectors, and providing facilities and opportunities for
              involvement by a much wider range of regional interests in
              Northern Ireland. Much reference was made to that in the debate on
              the Northern Ireland Centre in Europe. That was the initial aim of
              the centre — hence the name.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Northern Ireland Centre in Europe is
              refocusing and renaming its organisation. The Administration are
              working out a new relationship with the Northern Ireland Centre in
              Europe. Perhaps the Assembly could address that. The Office of the
              First Minister and the Deputy First Minister will ensure that the
              head of the Brussels office will develop the office and its work
              in building regional representation, not just as an office for the
              Executive. An office for the Executive is needed. However,
              Northern Ireland needs much greater regional representation in
              Brussels.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We will also be examining ways and means by
              which all the organisations that I mentioned — the social
              partners, the various agriculture representative bodies, the
              further and higher education sector, local government and, indeed,
              the Northern Ireland Centre in Europe itself — can become
              involved in building the collective and co-operative approach that
              was endorsed and recommended by the First Minister and the Deputy
              First Minister. The report provides further evidence, if further
              evidence were required, that that is the only sensible approach to
              those issues.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the period before devolution, as I told the
              Committee, officials worked in a difficult environment; policy
              lines were set in London and, often, there was little clear
              distinctive development of those lines to take account of our
              regional interests. However, the establishment of the devolved
              institutions removes that difficult dimension. As the report
              illustrates, there is now a clear political will to undertake an
              open and informed approach to developing a distinctive regional
              posture for Northern Ireland within the European framework. That
              will characterise the work of the Office of the First Minister and
              the Deputy First Minister, and we will ensure that it
              characterises the approach of the office in Brussels.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That takes me to the second theme, which is
              drawing on the learning available to us from our experience of the
              European Union to date and, indeed, the experience of other
              regions in the European Union. The theme also involves developing
              and drawing on the learning that different sectors of our society
              have derived from their work in Europe.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Over a decade ago, an initiative was undertaken
              to establish a centre where all sectors could consider how to
              address the issues arising from membership of the European Union.
              That initiative arose from work done by the main constitutional
              political parties of that time and led to the establishment of the
              Northern Ireland Centre in Europe. That organisation established a
              positive track record working with all parties and all sectors of
              our society. It greatly assisted and clarified the understanding
              of the challenges and the opportunities to be addressed. For many
              years, it was one of the few organisations in this society that
              had the full involvement and support of all the main
              constitutional political parties.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It secured support from all councils and from a
              wide range of interests in the private sector. For a time, the
              centre also secured the support of central Government. No one
              regrets more than I do —</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You may have been about to comment on this, but
              I just wanted clarification of the grand words about the Northern
              Ireland Centre in Europe. If the centre was so valuable and so
              good, what happened to it? Why is it half of itself?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Haughey:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was just coming to that. No one regrets what
              happened more than I do. No one worked harder to prevent it from
              happening than I did.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I could say an awful lot here. I could redd my
              chest. To do so would give me a great deal of satisfaction, but I
              do not believe that recrimination, name-calling, finger-pointing
              and laying blame and accusations will get us anywhere. What
              happened, happened. I fully agree with those who say that it was
              tragically unfair, but that does not measure the full importance
              of it. It was more than tragically unfair — it was a mistake of
              serious dimensions that has cost us dearly.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We are where we are, and we must build from
              that position. When I gave evidence to the Committee, I said that,
              because of the opportunities that now exist, we were currently
              engaged in rebuilding our relationship as an Administration, and
              the relationship of central Government here on the regional level,
              with the Northern Ireland Centre in Europe. That work is nearing
              completion, and I hope to be able to report fully and positively
              on the outcome of that to the Assembly in the very near future.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.00 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I acknowledge that many Members of the Assembly
              feel as strongly as I do about this. Many of them benefited in no
              small way from the clear, professional, independent analysis
              provided by the Northern Ireland Centre in Europe. Those who may
              wish to reflect on the issue should also reflect on the fact that
              I was among those members of my party who, along with leading
              members of the Ulster Unionist Party, the DUP, the Alliance Party
              and others, created that institution. Therefore, I do not want the
              value that I attach to it to be questioned in any way.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the Committee’s recommendation,
              which accords completely with the view taken by the First
              Minister, the Deputy First Minister, Mr Leslie and myself, that we
              now have the task of building on, and strengthening, the approach
              pioneered by the Northern Ireland Centre in Europe. I assure the
              Assembly that my ministerial Colleagues are at one in relation to
              that. We are putting in place mechanisms that will secure and
              widen the value of the independent analysis provided by a
              stronger, refocused and — as I said earlier — perhaps renamed
              organisation, and we shall ensure that value is applied across a
              range of issues.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Therefore, in considering the Committee’s
              report, the detail of the written submissions makes it clear that
              there is a wide level of support in this society for the work of
              the new democratic institutions established in this House. I
              welcome the significant degree of support expressed in those
              submissions, but that lays heavy responsibilities on those of us
              who are involved and who were elected to take those
              responsibilities. Among those responsibilities is one to find ways
              of drawing on the learning from the different sectors, especially
              from those who took the time and the trouble to make submissions
              to the Committee. Those organisations have clearly indicated that
              they are interested in more than simply lobbying for their own
              narrow concerns. They are willing participants in the collective
              work of developing a regional posture and strategy for Northern
              Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I also noted the Committee’s approach in
              taking evidence from a range of expert analysts and practitioners
              from other regions of the European Union. Those inputs have
              provided valuable insights as to how we can further develop our
              own approach. I have considered and discussed those submissions
              with officials, and we are keen that the Committee’s approach
              should be further developed. Measure 4.1 of the Peace II
              programme, ‘The Outward and Forward Looking Region’, which is
              implemented through the Office of the First Minister and the
              Deputy First Minister, offers us an opportunity to build on that
              process and to learn from our relationship with other regions of
              Europe by examining how they have done business. Measure 4.1 has
              been put in place to support further strategic examinations of how
              we relate to the European Union and beyond, to reflect on how we
              undertake our work here, and to seek ways in which we can learn
              together, thereby establishing better and more effective means of
              policy development and implementation.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In addition to the work that will be undertaken
              through that measure, we have asked officials to prepare proposals
              to build on the available learning. Those proposals will address a
              wide range of issues identified. For example, the potential
              benefits of secondment were frequently mentioned during the course
              of the debate. Other examples range from the question of ongoing
              research and analysis, more open work practices and better
              reporting systems to widening opportunities for considered inputs
              into policy development. Through that collective approach, the
              Administration will seek to integrate in a practical manner
              several observations and recommendations made by the Committee in
              its report.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Any initiatives must, of course, be in the
              context of effective, open and transparent working methods that
              make maximum use of the public resources invested. Many challenges
              and many opportunities arise from EU membership, and we must
              invest in early-warning systems if those are to be identified at a
              sufficiently early stage for them to be effective. Several Members
              made that point.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Where resources are scarce, we must ensure that
              we get the best return on our investment. The time is now right to
              examine the value of the approach that has been taken since
              devolution. That examination will provide evidence that will help
              us to ensure that we are using the most effective and efficient
              methods possible, and to make any necessary adjustments in cases
              in which we find any shortcomings.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome that the Committee intends to
              continue to monitor the analysis and recommendations of the
              report. I shall ensure that the Committee is provided with the
              full response to that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The report is a valuable analysis of the
              current situation. It provides a context in which we can clearly
              see the progress that has been made and the goals that are still
              to be attained. I thank the Chairperson of the Committee, Mr Poots,
              and his Colleagues for their detailed and constructive work. I
              also thank all who contributed to the report’s preparation. I
              assure the House that the Ministers in the Office of the First
              Minister and the Deputy First Minister will reflect on its
              analysis and recommendations, and seek to use them in the same
              positive and constructive spirit in which they were prepared.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Poots:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Members who participated in the
              debate for the largely positive and constructive contributions
              that they made. It is indicative of a growing interest in European
              Union affairs, and overall there has been a general welcome for
              the report and its recommendations.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Jane Morrice referred to the need to involve
              young people. The Committee would also like to see the greater
              involvement of young people in EU affairs. Indeed, one of the main
              themes in the report is the need to involve all people, including
              the young, in European issues. The recommendation that deals with
              secondment to non-governmental organisations covers the point that
              she made.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sean Neeson referred to the Committee of the
              Regions. The Committee of the Centre addresses that issue in
              paragraphs 134 and 135 on pages 30 and 31 of the report. It
              compared the mechanism for nomination used by the Office of the
              First Minister and the Deputy First Minister in Northern Ireland
              to that used by the Scottish Executive. In Scotland, provision was
              made for the involvement of the Scottish Parliament to endorse the
              Scottish nomination. The Committee understands that no similar
              provision exists in the relevant Northern Ireland papers. Despite
              the fact that the appointments were made in November, I only
              received notice of the appointees to the Committee of the Regions
              from the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister last week. I
              leave Members to draw their own conclusions from that.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fact that no provision was made for it does
              not mean that there should not have been any consultation with the
              Assembly. The Committee was eventually informed of the
              appointments following several requests for that information.
              Therefore, the Committee recommends that the Office of the First
              Minister and the Deputy First Minister follows the model used by
              the Scottish Executive and ensures that, although the Assembly is
              not involved in endorsing the nominations, it at least receives
              proper and timely notification of them.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Beggs and Dr Birnie referred to the creation
              of an EU affairs committee. I assure them that Committee members
              made that recommendation only after considerable thought, and they
              know that there will be difficulties, such as those that other
              Committees have experienced in achieving quorums. The Committee
              knows that the creation of such a committee must be looked at in
              the wider context. However, it feels that a marker must be set to
              show that the Committee thinks that EU affairs are important
              enough to warrant an independent committee.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Junior Minister Haughey also commented on the
              potential role of the EU affairs committee. Its role would be
              similar to those of the committees in the other devolved
              Administrations that deal with EU affairs. The Committee of the
              Centre did not envisage that such a committee would take up the
              remit of current Committees. The Committee of the Centre has had
              initial discussions about the EU affairs committee, but more work
              must be done. It is assumed that the committee would be strategic,
              and focus on cross-cutting issues rather than delve into
              departmental issues.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I largely welcome the junior Ministers’
              comments.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Haughey commented on the cost implications
              of the report. Although some recommendations will cost money, the
              majority have no or minimal cost implications. However, I must
              point out the cost of some European Directives. For example, it
              will cost some £400 million in capital alone to deliver the
              current waste management strategy that is being advertised heavily
              on TV. That is not to mention the recurrent year-on-year costs of
              delivering it. The amount of money that it would cost to implement
              this report’s recommendations in full would be peanuts compared
              to the cost of implementing some European Directives. In addition,
              savings could be made if we could, at an early stage, make changes
              to the small number of issues that affect Northern Ireland.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I regret the comments made by the junior
              Minister, Mr Leslie, about the activities of the MEPs. It ill
              behoves a Minister to use his position to attack Members of the
              European Parliament. Perhaps I can put that down to his
              inexperience.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Paisley Jnr:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I agree that the junior Minister Mr Leslie did
              not dress himself in any honour by making those comments. I hope
              that that is not an indication that the junior Ministers are going
              to continue to burn bridges with the MEPs. They should be building
              bridges to allow the MEPs’ expertise and experience to play a
              part because that will lead to a better understanding of, and a
              better commitment to, European affairs. We can all make cheap
              jibes. If the MEP that he was praising is doing such a wonderful
              job, why did he not use the professional staff in his Brussels
              office to make a written submission to the report. However, let us
              not make such silly points.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Poots:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall not take that point any further. I do
              not believe that the junior Minister was speaking on behalf of
              OFMDFM on that occasion.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the increase in the capacity of the
              European Policy Co-ordination Unit. Nevertheless, the Committee
              recommends that it should remain free-standing, and I know that
              Ministers will consider that in more detail.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to NICE, I take Mr Haughey’s
              comments at face value and accept what he says. I shall be
              watching developments on that closely to see what progress can be
              made.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">By and large, I am very encouraged by the
              response of Members and Ministers. Adopting this report will
              ensure better days for Northern Ireland in its dealings with
              European Union affairs and in what it derives from Europe. At some
              stage, it may be useful to conduct some research into how much it
              is costing Northern Ireland to implement European Union
              Directives. We often hear of the benefits of Europe and of how
              much we are drawing down in structural funds, peace fund money et
              cetera. However, it would be interesting to do a comparative study
              to establish how much we are having to spend to adhere to, and
              implement, European Union Directives.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank the Assembly for the time that it gave
              to this report and I look forward to its being adopted by the

              <p ALIGN="left"><b><font SIZE="3">Mr ONeill:</p>
              </font></b><center><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Initially I tabled this debate for November
              2001 when the crisis in maternity services had reached a new peak.
              There had been, and there still remains, urgent concern about the
              future of maternity services in Downpatrick and, indeed, the
              hospital itself. I was anxious that strict new guidelines that
              barred specific women from giving birth in their local hospital
              would reduce the rates of delivery in the hospital by between 10%
              and 20%, thus making the hospital appear less credible. I want to
              re-emphasise that issue. The Minister subsequently gave a
              commitment that the full range of services would be available
              until the outcome of the review was known. While we patiently wait
              for reviews, and sometimes reviews of reviews, there is a great
              danger of the existing services becoming even further eroded. If
              that were to continue, by the time reviews have finally been
              published, the case for maternity services in particular will have
              been reduced.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sceptics might say that that could be seen by
              some people in the Department of Health, Social Services and
              Public Safety as a convenient way to handle the decision without
              having to take responsibility for that decision. Down Lisburn
              Trust is running into an underfunding gap, estimated at £9·1
              million, but some would say that it may well run to £12 million.
              That lack of investment in professional services must be
              responsible for the reduction in the numbers of higher-risk
              pregnancies being taken into the Downe Hospital. Down District
              Council is calling for that shortfall to be made up and for the
              situation to be restored. The local health trust has met the
              Department’s requirements for funding controls, and it has been
              punished because other health trusts had not met their required
              levels. Funding has had to be redistributed, and the impact is now
              being felt.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In November 2001, we were informed that
              anaesthetists were refusing to provide facilities for mothers who
              were overweight, who were expecting multiple births, who had
              previously undergone a Caesarean section, or who were under any
              threat of early labour. Notably, the decision to adopt new
              stringent criteria was taken without consultation with the people
              whom it would affect. The threat to the maternity services in the
              Downe Hospital is a direct threat to the rights of the community.
              It is not a little backwater hospital. In 2001, Downpatrick
              Maternity Hospital was recognised by the Imperial College of
              Science, Technology and Medicine as the third safest unit in
              Northern Ireland. That small rural unit has a history of high
              standards, good service and continuity of care, which is highly
              valued by the local community. The professionals on the ground —
              the obstetricians and midwives — have attacked the criteria as
              being unduly restrictive, and there are statistics that prove that
              they effectively screened out 50 mothers-to-be, who were
              transferred to Belfast hospitals. The numbers being admitted to
              the hospital are being eroded continually, thus undermining the
              case that the Minister will have to report on shortly and the
              recommendations that she will have to make for the continuity of
              the service.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some questions spring to my mind. Have those
              circumstances been properly taken into consideration? What are the
              consequences for the future of Downpatrick Maternity Hospital?
              Have all other hospitals in similar situations been subjected to
              the same criteria? Is the Minister of Health, Social Services and
              Public Safety satisfied that our anaesthetists’ response to the
              needs of our maternity and other acute services in Downe Hospital
              has been the proper one?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When I look back over the years during which we
              have tried to fight for the retention of acute services in Downe
              Hospital, it occurs to me that we, especially in Down district,
              have been subjected to a bureaucratic form of snakes and ladders.
              During the past few years, we have had documents, reports,
              consultations and strategies commenting on various ways by which
              services should be offered by Downe Hospital and Downpatrick
              Maternity Hospital. Each subsequent throw of the dice seems to
              have further eroded the services and further strengthened
              centralist thinking.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We reached the top of a ladder in 1994 when
              Baroness Denton recognised the need for a new Downe Hospital,
              which would incorporate maternity services. We then hit a snake’s
              head with the changes made by Ministers Worthington and McFall and
              slid all the way down. Now, as far as maternity services are
              concerned, it looks as if we have encountered another snake. As a
              public representative, I am concerned that centralist
              professionals, few in number, are using their key professional
              positions to further their centralist political aims. I am
              concerned that their work may result in a lack of will to keep the
              maternity services open.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Then, of course, there is the broader issue.
              Will we always manage our services subject to diktats from royal
              colleges? Now that we have a devolved Administration, should we
              not make policy decisions that meet our particular needs? This is
              the first time that people of our generation have had the
              opportunity to structure our services to meet our particular
              needs, and it is our responsibility to ensure that we base such a
              structure on real, existing and future needs, and not on the need
              to sacrifice maternity services in order to maintain other
              services for the area.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">By threatening the training accreditation,
              royal colleges further risked the future of the hospital. Down
              district has recognised that Downe Hospital and Downpatrick
              Maternity Hospital must be linked to appropriate Belfast hospitals
              for third-level care and specialist diagnosis. If activated at
              this stage, that link would ensure continued accreditation for
              those working in Downpatrick Maternity Hospital through the
              rotation of staff. Rotational training between the hospitals will
              ensure that all our professionals will meet royal colleges
              criteria and is a way around the difficulty that they identified.
              It will ensure that essential services are kept open in the
              district while plans for the new Downe Hospital are implemented.
              The case for the retention of maternity services remains strong in
              Down.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are no immediate plans to upgrade the two
              main roads between south Down and Belfast that pass through
              Downpatrick and Ballynahinch. There are demands for bypasses
              around both towns because they are bottlenecked at significant
              times during the working day. Housing development has increased
              heavily in south Down, and the growing population in the area will
              be most evident in the forthcoming census results. Many people
              travel to and from Belfast to work, thus congesting the already
              inadequate road system. It is clear that access to Belfast
              hospitals, which currently stands at one hour, will not get any
              easier — in fact, it will get worse.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The joint review team said that there is no
              doubt that the standard of services in the community would
              deteriorate if maternity services were removed. In line with their
              human rights, the women of Down district, an area served by
              Downpatrick Maternity Hospital, should have the choice of having
              their babies delivered locally.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is accepted by the joint review team that
              many women will have neither the desire nor the means to travel to
              Belfast to give birth; a rise in home births and related concerns
              is therefore anticipated. It also estimates that in the past five
              years, four or five babies in the area would not have survived the
              journey from their homes to Belfast. To accept the closure of
              Downpatrick Maternity Hospital, would be to accept that it is all
              right to see four or five infants die each year. How can we
              possibly accept that?</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the Down area, it is widely accepted that
              the maternity hospital provides a necessary service for our local
              community, and the entire community will suffer as a result of any
              diminution of that service. I would like to see the threat to its
              existence totally removed.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Wells:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a somewhat younger Member of the House, when
              I was elected here in 1982, the first obvious crisis that arose in
              the constituency of South Down was yet another threat to the
              future of the Downe Hospital. I remember the then Health and
              Social Services Committee visiting the hospital. We were informed
              that the hospital’s entire future, including Downpatrick
              Maternity Hospital, was under imminent threat. Some 20 years
              later, we are debating exactly the same problem.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What is going on in Downe Hospital reminds me
              of plates spinning in a circus. No sooner is one plate spinning
              than another is about to collapse to the floor; no sooner has one
              important aspect of the Downe Hospital come under threat and been
              saved as a result of public outcry than one finds another crucial
              element of the hospital under threat.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If all the newspaper cuttings, reports and
              documents that were printed on Downe Hospital in the past 25 years
              were laid out, they would cover many football pitches. It is only
              as a result of the tenacity of the local council — I pay tribute
              to Councillor ONeill and many others for their stance on the issue
              — and the community that we are even here this evening debating
              anything concerning Downpatrick Maternity Hospital. If it were not
              for that tenacity, there would not currently be a hospital to
              debate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have grave doubts about royal college
              assertions that everything must be bound by numbers. Those numbers
              take no account whatsoever of an expectant mother who goes into
              labour on a wet Saturday night in an area such as Killough,
              Ardglass or Strangford. She is currently faced with a relatively
              straightforward journey into Downpatrick. Without that maternity
              unit, she faces the nightmare of travelling into Belfast.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Not all babies will decide to come at
              convenient times. There will be those who will decide to arrive
              during the rush hour. Councillor ONeill and I have both been
              involved in calls for bypasses for both Downpatrick and
              Ballynahinch. As Mr ONeill said, it is difficult enough to get
              through those towns at the best of occasions. However, the
              situation in which a lady who is about to give birth is trying to
              get through those towns in an ambulance is absolutely horrendous.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I simply do not see the issue as a numbers one.
              We have been set this high threshold target by the royal colleges,
              and I fully accept that Downpatrick Maternity Hospital does not
              meet the target. There are less than than 500 births there a year.
              However, one must look at some of the reasons behind that. So much
              doubt has been cast over the future of the maternity unit in
              Downpatrick that many women have decided to go elsewhere to have
              their babies. A guarantee of the future security of Downpatrick
              Maternity Hospital would increase confidence, and more people
              would choose to have their deliveries in Downpatrick Maternity
              Hospital.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">5.30 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no doubt that the maternity unit will
              die the death of a thousand cuts. At times, I do not know where to
              turn. We thought that the problem had been solved, but then a
              great difficulty arose with the cover for anaesthetists. At one
              stage, there was a real threat that the unit would close due to
              the lack of anaesthetic cover. Then, as the result of a huge
              outcry, we managed — mostly due to the Down community health
              committee — to obtain adequate anaesthetic cover. No sooner had
              that been solved than we found that the future of the maternity
              unit was again in doubt. That ignores the fact that in the Ards
              and Down area plan 7,000 new homes are allocated in the area
              covered by the maternity unit. Most will be starter homes for
              young couples. There could be a significant increase in the number
              of births in Downpatrick. However, we could reach a ridiculous
              situation in which the maternity unit is closed but where a large
              increase in births means that a unit is needed on our doorstep.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I do not understand the mentality that suggests
              that all services must be centralised. I can understand to some
              extent the logic of the royal colleges’ assertion that
              consultants must attend at numerous births if they are to develop
              the full range of specialities and have experience of complex
              births. Why can those specialities not be concentrated in
              Downpatrick? Why must they be concentrated in Greater Belfast? The
              consultants’ tail may be wagging the Department’s dog. Perhaps
              consultants enjoy living in the leafy suburbs of south Belfast or
              on the gold coast of north Down and think that Downpatrick is on
              the edge of the universe. The Government in Northern Ireland —
              even post-devolution — believe that the world ends at
              Glengormley, and the really adventurous believe that the world
              ends at Carryduff. There is life beyond Carryduff. Many live
              fulfilled and happy lives in south Down. They do not believe that
              the concentration of services should be entirely in Belfast.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Possibly the only point that Mr ONeill did not
              raise was that the maternity unit offers employment opportunities
              to people in south Down. So great is the lack of industrial
              investment in south Down that the two major employers in
              Downpatrick are the district council and the hospital. They are
              essential employers. I got an e-mail this morning from Sir Reg
              Empey’s office saying that he was visiting Downpatrick. I
              immediately rushed to find out which factories he was visiting. As
              it turned out, he was going to a function to celebrate the work of
              Mr McGrady — a very good cause, I must say; I do not condemn him
              at all. It shows, however, how little industrial investment there
              is in Downpatrick. It would not take very long to visit all its
              factories.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The maternity unit is a vital employer in the
              town, and it would be appalling to lose it. The campaign will go
              on, and I am convinced that the community will rally round to
              hammer home the point that Downpatrick is not prepared to be a
              second-class citizen to Greater Belfast. We must retain the unit.
              As Mr ONeill said, if the unit closes and a mother dies tragically
              in labour or a newborn child dies in an ambulance that is caught
              in a traffic jam on the way to Belfast, people will then realise
              what a dreadful mistake it would be to have closed this unit.</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr M Murphy:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Éamonn ONeill for bringing this
              serious problem before the Assembly. I am very disappointed that
              only two members of the Committee for Health, Social Services and
              Public Safety are present. That shows how seriously they take the
              Downe Hospital.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To maintain the safety of the facilities, and
              the good health of mothers and babies in South Down, we need a
              fully staffed and equipped maternity service. There has always
              been a high standard of quality and safety in Downpatrick
              Maternity Hospital, where arrangements for mothers and babies have
              worked very well. I wish to see those standards maintained, and I
              take this opportunity to pay tribute to the staff, who have
              maintained those standards under extreme difficulties over this
              period of uncertainty.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Under the Hayes Report, those standards are
              being undermined. I want the same quality of service for the
              people of east Down as is enjoyed by those in Newry and Mourne and
              south Armagh. The people of Kilcoo, Leitrim, Legananny,
              Castlewellan, Newcastle, Ballynahinch, Dromore and Drumaroad need
              a proper service and a proper roads infrastructure for easy
              access. Those considerations have not been properly addressed in
              the Hayes Report.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I shall now address the most important issues
              relating to the provision of a proper maternity service for a new
              hospital in Downpatrick. It is the right of every woman to have
              the required expertise available and to have the birth experience
              that she wants. Pregnancy and giving birth have become medicalised.
              We have some of the highest rates of hospital births in Europe and
              high rates of medical intervention in labour — Caesarean
              sections and other surgical interventions. Our intervention rates
              are far higher than they need to be. The majority of births are
              normal and require no specialist or medical intervention.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am convinced by many of the arguments put
              forward by the Royal College of Midwives in favour of midwife-led
              maternity teams. Indeed, the early evidence suggests that women
              making use of the midwife-led maternity teams in Craigavon are
              very happy. This also means that we need to re-evaluate the role
              and status of the midwife, with the creation of the consultant
              grade midwife becoming standard.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, in the small minority of cases that do
              require medical intervention, it is important that the highest
              levels of professional care and facilities are available. Sinn
              Féin in south Down rejected the proposal for a £15 million
              cottage hospital because it would not have retained acute or
              maternity services in Down. We have consistently argued that a new
              hospital in Downpatrick needs both. Sinn Féin in south Down will
              not settle for far less than is needed for the local population,
              or less than they deserve. That is why we argued against a smaller
              hospital with less capacity and fewer services. The SDLP appears
              to be prepared to accept less than people deserve. That is not
              surprising, given that it has happily settled for less than people
              need or deserve on policing. The people of County Down must not be
              short-changed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The future of maternity services is tied to the
              review of acute hospitals and the Hayes Report. I look forward to
              having the opportunity to examine the proposals put forward by the
              Minister of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, Bairbre de
              Brún, when they have been approved by the Executive. The Hayes
              Report acknowledges that radical changes in the organisation of
              our acute hospitals, and a dramatic increase in resources, are
              required.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Hayes Report has broken with convention,
              and it offers proposals that will create significant change in how
              services are delivered. It highlights the key role of patients and
              service users in making decisions. The proposals will be judged on
              their ability to deliver equality of access to services. The
              Minister, Bairbre de Brún, has begun to win the argument with the
              Executive for increased resources to put right the struggling
              scheme that she inherited. Everyone will welcome the SDLP’s
              commitment to lobby their Finance Minister to support Ms de Brún.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the key issues that has affected the
              delivery of maternity services in the Six Counties is the power of
              the royal colleges to set quotas for the number of births that
              must take place on a site in order for consultants and junior
              doctors to be given accreditation. The removal of maternity
              services from Tyrone clearly demonstrates that the operation of
              quotas is detrimental to the accessible delivery of a quality
              service. The requirements of the medical service for groups of
              doctors to work together stems from the fact that doctors are no
              longer covering the full range of a speciality but, rather, are
              increasingly developing their expertise in more focused areas of
              work. Larger teams have to be assembled to support this approach,
              and that is leading to the concentration of caseloads on fewer
              sites.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As part of maintaining official recognition,
              doctors and nurses need to see a certain number of patients with a
              specific condition in order to maintain their expertise. The royal
              colleges have said that training recognition may be withdrawn from
              a hospital if there is an insufficient number of patients to
              enable trainees to get the right experience, or if there is
              insufficient supervision for trainees. It is quite clear from this
              approach that the maintenance of medical status is being
              prioritised above the requirements of creating a high-quality
              service that is accessible to the people of Down.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is clear that meeting targets is more
              important than the treatment of patients. Guidelines and standards
              have been set in relation to minimum patient numbers that must be
              achieved to maintain services. Some 1,500 to 2,000 deliveries are
              required to sustain a maternity service. In this case, sustaining
              the service means that the royal colleges have decided to set
              quotas that need to be achieved in order for an acceptable quality
              of service to be developed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Women might have to travel greater distances,
              perhaps without the benefit of personal transport. It has been
              said that it takes an hour to travel from Down to one of the
              hospitals in Belfast, but there is no way that it would take an
              hour or less to travel from Newcastle at the height of the tourist
              season. That does not appear to be a concern for the royal
              colleges.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The monetary considerations, the status of the
              medical profession and the setting of targets all call into
              question the goal of achieving a balance between high quality and
              access to the service, with the latter failing to be taken into
              proper account. These decisions highlight the power of vested
              interests — the very interests that have medicalised the natural
              process of pregnancy and giving birth.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I call on the Executive to give priority to
              making the resources available for this new hospital in Down. The
              people of east Down require acute and maternity services, not a
              cottage hospital.</p>

              </i><b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGrady:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I welcome the opportunity to participate in
              this important debate and to endorse what my party Colleague from
              south Down, Mr ONeill, said when he opened the Adjournment debate.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As has already been said, Downpatrick Maternity
              Hospital has been under threat for 20 years — even before the
              original hospital was built — given a constant barrage of
              undermining activity by the Department. There is no question about
              the quality of care in Downpatrick Maternity Hospital. Antenatal
              care, delivery care and postnatal care are excellent, and that has
              been acknowledged by professionals. The surroundings of the
              hospital for the mothers and the babies are also excellent, and if
              only we could get mothers from any part of Northern Ireland
              through the door, they would be registering in the Downpatrick
              Maternity Hospital for their deliveries.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are, however, a number of impediments to
              that. It is not of the Minister’s doing, but of her predecessor’s.
              It may not even be of her predecessor’s doing, but of the
              Department’s doing, and that is the policy of centralising
              maternity services. Unless the Minister and the Executive can
              redirect departmental policy, centralisation will continue to be
              the policy and the drive behind the closure of hospitals such as
              the Downpatrick Maternity Hospital. That is why it is so important
              that we target the source of problem — the policy decision to
              centralise.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many Members have correctly quoted — and it
              has been quoted often — the Royal College of Obstetricians and
              Gynaecologists which has made certain insinuations regarding
              throughput. I want to place on record a reply to a letter that I
              sent it. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists
              replied on 26 June 1998, and I quote directly from it:</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;I should explain that the college has not
              issued any guidelines relating to the minimum number of deliveries
              which a consultant in a maternity unit should have per year.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It has not issued any guidelines, yet this is
              what has been said time and again as part of departmental PR spin
              of the centralists. The Minister and the Department must tackle
              this. That came out officially in the Baird Report some 20 years
              ago, and that is where the figure of 2,000 came from.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A few years ago the Eastern Health and Social
              Services Board dealt with the points made by Members about
              geographical isolation and the needs of the communities of Down
              and Mourne. I quote from its strategy document:</p>
              </font><font SIZE="1">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;In recognition of the relative
              geographical isolation of the area served by the Downpatrick
              Maternity Hospital, the board is prepared to continue to purchase
              consultant-led obstetric services in Downpatrick even though the
              number of births are not expected to reach DHHS guideline numbers.
              That is current board policy.&quot;</p>
              </font><font SIZE="3">
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Again I direct the debate to where the problem
              lies: the centralisation policy in the Department must be changed
              immediately. For instance, when Maurice Hayes was asked to carry
              out a review of acute services, his terms of remit specifically
              excluded maternity services because they were already under the
              diktat of the policy decision of the Department. This was before
              the Minister’s time, so she is not responsible for that.
              However, that is where it still is, so the Minister is responsible
              for continuing that policy if that is what we get in the
              post-Hayes era.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The constant undermining of the Downpatrick
              Maternity Hospital has sadly led to the anticipation that only 54%
              of all births in County Down will take place at that hospital. Why
              is that? As I have said, the care and the surroundings are
              excellent, and my Colleagues have spoken about that. There is the
              constant black propaganda of the Department, which is undermining
              the confidence of young mothers-to-be or not so young
              mothers-to-be that the service will be available by the time their
              deliveries take place, so they do not register in that wonderful
              setting. We only have to look back to the events of 18&nbsp;March,
              when the anaesthetists from the hospital took unilateral action
              that almost led to its immediate closure. That was not a decision
              of the board, the trust or the Department — the Department did
              not know what was happening.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Much has been said about the difficulty of
              travelling from the catchment area of the Downpatrick Maternity
              Hospital to Belfast. Equally important, modern medicine tells us
              that a substantial part of the recovery programme for patients is
              family support. Families can easily and frequently visit a
              hospital like Downpatrick to give support to mothers-to-be or the
              mothers and their babies. That accelerates their sense of
              well-being and they get well quickly.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, there is a problem with service
              delivery in the Downpatrick. For example, the paediatric
              consultant does not have full facilities, and there is no epidural
              procedure available because of the infrequent attendance of
              anaesthetists. These are money-led restrictions, and there is no
              reason, with an equality agenda, for those facilities’ not being
              made available on a partnership basis with the Royal Maternity
              Hospital or the Lagan Valley Hospital to mothers-to-be who want
              them. That would give additional facility and confidence.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the policy of centralisation, which is
              another word for closure, continues, what is to happen to the
              expanded population in these areas? The area served by Downpatrick
              Maternity Hospital is one of the few areas outside Belfast which
              is expanding rapidly — it is the most rapidly expanding area in
              Northern Ireland, according to the last census. For those reasons,
              this matter must be addressed once and for all. The remit of the
              Hayes Report did not include maternity services — I am subject
              to correction on this — but it said that maternity services
              would be centralised in Belfast. However, the Hayes Report was
              dealing with acute services in general medicine and surgery, not
              with maternity services, which was a stand-aside subject at that
              time. In another context the Hayes Report suggested partnership as
              a way forward.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is with regret that I note that Mr Mick
              Murphy, the Sinn Féin Member for South Down, introduced party
              politics to an apolitical subject. Sinn Féin did the same locally
              to great detriment, and now it is doing the same in this debate.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Wells:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Does the hon Member also agree that it does
              enormous damage to the united community front in the Down area,
              where the entire community is united on preserving the hospital,
              when one element uses the issue as a party political football to
              undermine the campaign to return acute and maternity services to
              Downpatrick?</p>
              <b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr McGrady:</p>
              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I can only concur with the hon Member’s
              remarks.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The facts were also grossly wrong; therefore
              the record must be put straight. First, as stated, the new
              hospital for Downpatrick was accepted and supported as the way
              forward by me, the SDLP and the entire cross-party membership of
              Down District Council, with the proviso that it must include
              proper acute services. The support was for the building, rather
              than for the services that were suggested for it.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Secondly, that building — that new start —
              would have been under construction as we speak. I am confident
              that in that building we could have had enhanced facilities for
              acute medical and surgical services and for the maternity
              hospital. We would have had one campus for the consultants and
              their various disciplines, whereas we currently have two campuses.
              However, the money that was set aside for that building has gone
              and must be found again. The procurement of the highest
              technology, which was in train, was cancelled and must be started
              again.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will take no sermons from Sinn Féin in that
              respect. I regret very much that party politics has crept into the
              debate again. That party even opposed the planning permission for
              a hospital, never mind the detail of the plan itself. In that
              context, it ill behoves the Sinn Féin Member to try to divide the
              community again, when it is totally unanimous in its support for
              the Downpatrick Maternity and Downe hospitals. We know, as local
              residents and as patients, that we are getting a first-class
              service from consultants, doctors, nurses and staff at every
              level. Their humanity and their expertise in their respective
              disciplines have helped them to achieve a record that is the envy
              of any part of Northern Ireland. The cost-effectiveness and the
              medical effectiveness of both hospitals have been commented upon
              time and again.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The essential decision about maternity, as
              distinct from acute, services is that the policy of
              centralisation, which has been prescribed and promoted by the
              Department, should be changed. Unless it is changed, the natural
              and inevitable consequence of centralisation will be the closure
              of rural hospitals in favour of central ones. That would sound the
              death knell of flexibility. As has been proven time and again by
              reports, without access to the Downpatrick Maternity Hospital 24
              hours a day, mothers and their unborn babies will be put in
              danger.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In spite of all the requirements of the
              consultant-led diktats, the safety and performance records of the
              Downpatrick Maternity Hospital at the last audit were the best in
              Northern Ireland. Are we going to throw away the best?</p>

              </b>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am aware of the time limit that was set for
              this debate by the Business Committee. With that in mind, I call

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I will make my speech brief, Mr Deputy Speaker;
              I will not even attempt to go over all the facts and figures,
              which Mr ONeill, Mr Wells and Mr McGrady so ably contributed.
              However, Mr Wells touched upon one aspect, which concerns my
              constituents in Strangford. A proportion of constituents in
              Strangford do not look to the likes of the Ulster Hospital —
              much less to Belfast — for services, including maternity
              provision.</p>
              <i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">6.00 pm</p>
              </i>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That group of people seek to receive their
              services from the Downe Hospital. However, due to uncertainty
              about the future of general services at the hospital, those people
              no longer look towards Downpatrick for their services, despite it
              being their first preference when given the choice.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mr Wells mentioned that babies do not choose
              the most convenient time to be born. Ambulances may have to travel
              from the southern part of my constituency via Comber to the Ulster
              Hospital in Dundonald. I do not know if the Minister has ever
              visited Comber, or if she is aware that at the best of times it is
              a difficult town through which to drive. Rush hour is an absolute
              nightmare. A bypass is in the pipeline, and that has been
              welcomed. However, it will be several years before it is
              completed.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is no exaggeration to say that, in an
              emergency, an ambulance trying to get through Comber during rush
              hour may not be able to reach the Ulster Hospital. Recently, the
              local press highlighted a case in which a fire engine that was
              trying to get from one side of Comber to the other during rush
              hour was unable to do so. A tender had to be dispatched from a
              fire station in Carryduff. An emergency vehicle was caught up in
              Comber traffic and was prevented from reaching its destination
              because it could not get through to the other side of the town. If
              that can happen once, it can happen twice. It could happen when an
              ambulance is trying to rush an expectant mother through Comber to
              the Ulster Hospital.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am indebted to the Deputy Speaker for
              allowing me to contribute to the debate at such short notice. The
              people who live in the part of Strangford that I represent, who
              look to the Downe Hospital for maternity care, have a right to
              receive it there and to be given access to the highest level of
              care, delivered in the quickest possible time. That can be found
              at Downpatrick Maternity Hospital. I congratulate Mr ONeill for
              tabling the Adjournment debate.</p>

              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I thank Mr ONeill for tabling the debate. As
              with all hospital services, maternity provision must reflect
              modern standards and best practice. Current good practice requires
              that deliveries should not take place when there is a significant
              likelihood that the mother or the newborn baby will require
              services that are not available on site. The maternity service at
              Downpatrick is classified as a low-risk, consultant-led unit.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Arrangements have been in place for several
              years for the transfer of pregnancies judged as high risk by
              clinicians at the hospital. In his opening address, Éamonn ONeill
              asked about those risk criteria. It is important that risk
              criteria be kept under review to achieve the right balance between
              risk and accessibility. I am advised that the screening of
              referrals at the Downpatrick Maternity Hospital was examined as
              part of that review process.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Similar work is also being undertaken in other
              hospitals. For example, transfer criteria are already in place at
              Lagan Valley Hospital and the Mater Infirmorum Hospital Health and
              Social Services Trust. I am also advised that many variables must
              be considered as part of the risk assessment process and that
              those may lead to the development of different criteria for
              different units.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am further advised that Down Lisburn Trust’s
              recent audit of the new criteria confirmed that less than one
              transfer per week has taken place as a consequence of the
              revisions to the risk management criteria. The Eastern Health and
              Social Services Board considers that that small increase in
              transfers should not cause significant difficulties for other
              units that have been experiencing declines in the number of
              overall births in recent years.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The number of babies born at the Downpatrick
              Maternity Hospital remains the lowest of any of maternity units
              here. By way of comparison, between 1 April 2001 and 31 March
              2002, Lagan Valley Hospital had 1,086 births and Downpatrick
              Maternity Hospital had 462. During that period, the Royal Jubilee
              Maternity Service delivered 4,708 babies and the Mater delivered
              1,058. Mick Murphy and Eddie McGrady both referred to royal
              college guidelines regarding the number of births. I do not accept
              that 1,500 to 2,000 deliveries are necessary to sustain a
              consultant-led maternity service. That would not take account of
              the needs of people here.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Although deliveries at Downpatrick are fewer
              than those at other maternity units, I fully appreciate the high
              regard in which that unit is held, and the skill and expertise of
              all staff at the hospital. Indeed, I recently met a delegation of
              midwives from the hospital to discuss developments there, and I
              was extremely impressed by the excellent work that they have
              undertaken to enhance and develop their skills for the good of all
              those who use the service.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Jim Wells talked about the growing population
              in the Down area. However, in the past 10 years, births fell by
              20% in the Eastern Board area as a whole, in the Down area by 14%
              and in the Downpatrick Maternity Hospital by 30%.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In his opening comments, Éamonn ONeill asked
              about consultation and choice. I am advised that the Eastern
              Health and Social Services Board extended the criteria in
              consultation with medical and midwifery staff at the unit earlier
              this year, and that some of those staff are members of the Royal
              College of Midwives and the Royal College of Obstetricians and
              Gynaecologists.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to consultation with other units, I
              am advised that the trust considered that the one additional
              transfer a week could not cause difficulties. As I said, the trust’s
              recent audit of those criteria has shown that to be the correct
              number. I am further advised that the decision to extend the
              criteria was based on clinical judgement and that such decisions
              are considered necessary for ensuring the safety and well-being of
              service users.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the question of underfunding of the Down
              Lisburn Trust and whether that has undermined the maternity
              service, the trust’s most recent annual general meeting
              confirmed that the maternity service at the Downpatrick Maternity
              Hospital is receiving £500,000 more in funding than it did three
              years ago.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Mick Murphy asked about support for midwife-led
              units. I fully support, and will actively promote, the careful
              development of midwife-led maternity units that are within, or
              adjacent to, a consultant-led maternity unit. I am also aware of
              pilot stand-alone midwife-led units being established in England,
              Wales and the South of Ireland. I am keen to explore the
              opportunities for such developments here.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Members raised concerns about the future of the
              service, with particular reference being made to the report of the
              acute hospitals review group. That group was not constrained in
              any way from looking at maternity services, and it has made
              recommendations on them. The report addressed maternity services
              in Downpatrick and noted the difficulties in sustaining an
              inpatient maternity unit with 24-hour anaesthetic and paediatric
              cover. The review group recommended the phasing out of inpatient
              maternity services in Downpatrick, but considered that it should
              be possible to provide the whole spectrum of maternity services,
              with the exception of inpatient care, at the time of birth.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have on several occasions in the Assembly
              made it clear that no decisions have yet been taken on the future
              of acute hospitals here. Proposals for the future of maternity
              services in Downpatrick will form part of a package of proposals
              that will be published for consultation after discussion by the
              Executive. A draft memorandum has been forwarded to the First
              Minister, the Deputy First Minister and the Minister of Finance
              and Personnel for clearance before consideration by the Executive.
              When proposals are put out to consultation they will provide
              communities and their representatives with an opportunity to
              comment on and contribute to the development of acute services
              here. In the meantime, I expect the Eastern Health and Social
              Services Board and the Down Lisburn Trust to do everything
              possible to maintain services at Downpatrick, pending strategic
              decisions on future arrangements for hospital services.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several significant steps have already been
              taken to sustain the Downpatrick Maternity Hospital, and mention
              was made of some of those in the debate. I pay tribute to all
              involved at every level in the service who have worked together to
              make many of those steps possible. For example, the arrangements
              involving Belfast anaesthetists have been introduced to maintain a
              robust anaesthetic service at Downpatrick Maternity Hospital, and
              I understand that those are working well. Five extra theatre
              nurses have been appointed to assist with the 24-hour anaesthetic
              rota. Moreover, the training programme for midwives has been
              reviewed, and all midwives are now offered the opportunity for
              advanced life-support training. Those measures demonstrate a clear
              commitment to sustaining high-quality maternity services at the
              Downpatrick Maternity Hospital, pending the outcome of the acute
              hospitals review.</p>
              <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I recognise that there are problems in
              sustaining our smaller hospitals, and I am aware of the discussion
              generated by the acute hospitals review. I appreciate that all the
              staff at the Downe Hospital and the Downpatrick Maternity Hospital
              have worked tirelessly to maintain safe and effective services,
              and to provide the highest standard of care to the local
              community. I recently visited the hospital and had the opportunity
              to meet staff and patients. I saw at first hand the high regard in
              which the hospital and staff are held. My aim is to ensure that
              the skills and expertise of all the staff at Downpatrick continue
              to be used in providing effective, high-quality maternity services
              in which the community — and women, in particular — can be
              confident.</p>
